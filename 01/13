These operations are sometimes only possible, or most\nefficiently executed, as resamplings of the Fourier transform $\\tilde F(u)$ of\nthe image onto a $u$-space grid that differs from the one produced by a\ndiscrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the samples. In some applications it is\nessential that the resampled image be accurate to better than 1 part in $10^3$,\nso in this paper we first use standard Fourier techniques to show that\nFourier-domain interpolation with a wrapped sinc function yields the exact\nvalue of $\\tilde F(u)$ in terms of the input samples and kernel. This operation\nscales with image dimension as $N^4$ and can be prohibitively slow, so we next\ninvestigate the errors accrued from approximating the sinc function with a\ncompact kernel. We show that these approximations produce a multiplicative\nerror plus a pair of ghost images (in each dimension) in the simulated image.\nStandard Lanczos or cubic interpolators, when applied in Fourier domain,\nproduce unacceptable artifacts. We find that errors $<1$ part in $10^3$ can be\nobtained by (1) 4-fold zero-padding of the original image before executing the\n$x\\rightarrow u$ DFT, followed by (2) resampling to the desired $u$ grid using\na 6-point, piecewise-quintic interpolant that we design expressly to minimize\nthe ghosts, then (3) executing the DFT back to $x$ domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jan 2014 16:20:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 12:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In the past, global\nfits, based mainly on larger $Q$ Drell-Yan-like processes, have found\nsubstantial contributions from non-perturbative regions in the Collins-Soper\nevolution kernel. In this article, we investigate semi-inclusive deep inelastic\nscattering measurements in the region of relatively small $Q$, of the order of\na few GeV, where sensitivity to non-perturbative transverse momentum dependence\nmay become more important or even dominate the evolution. Using recently\navailable deep inelastic scattering data from the COMPASS experiment, we\nprovide estimates of the regions of coordinate space that dominate in TMD\nprocesses when the hard scale is of the order of only a few GeV. We find that\ndistance scales that are much larger than those commonly probed in large $Q$\nmeasurements become important, suggesting that the details of non-perturbative\neffects in TMD evolution are especially significant in the region of\nintermediate $Q$. We highlight the strongly universal nature of the\nnon-perturbative component of evolution, and its potential to be tightly\nconstrained by fits from a wide variety of observables that include both large\nand moderate $Q$.

A sequence profile is usually represented as a\nposition-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) or an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and\naccordingly PSSM-PSSM or HMM-HMM comparison is used for homolog detection. This\npaper presents a new homology detection method MRFalign, consisting of three\nkey components: 1) a Markov Random Fields (MRF) representation of a protein\nfamily; 2) a scoring function measuring similarity of two MRFs; and 3) an\nefficient ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) algorithm aligning\ntwo MRFs. Compared to HMM that can only model very short-range residue\ncorrelation, MRFs can model long-range residue interaction pattern and thus,\nencode information for the global 3D structure of a protein family.\nConsequently, MRF-MRF comparison for remote homology detection shall be much\nmore sensitive than HMM-HMM or PSSM-PSSM comparison. Experiments confirm that\nMRFalign outperforms several popular HMM or PSSM-based methods in terms of both\nalignment accuracy and remote homology detection and that MRFalign works\nparticularly well for mainly beta proteins. For example, tested on the\nbenchmark SCOP40 (8353 proteins) for homology detection, PSSM-PSSM and HMM-HMM\nsucceed on 48% and 52% of proteins, respectively, at superfamily level, and on\n15% and 27% of proteins, respectively, at fold level. In contrast, MRFalign\nsucceeds on 57.3% and 42.5% of proteins at superfamily and fold level,\nrespectively.

Our imaging method works\nunder ambient conditions and can measure ubiquitous 'dark' spins, which\nconstitute nearly all spin targets of interest and cannot otherwise be\nindividually detected. In this technique, the magnetic quantum-projection noise\nof dark spins is measured using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometer\nlocated near the surface of a diamond chip. The spatial distribution of spins\nsurrounding the NV magnetometer is imaged with a scanning magnetic-field\ngradient. To evaluate the performance of the NV-MRI technique, we image the\nthree-dimensional landscape of dark electronic spins at and just below the\ndiamond surface and achieve an unprecedented combination of resolution (0.8 nm\nlaterally and 1.5 nm vertically) and single-spin sensitivity.

Next, we focus on the extension of these results to\nparallel interference networks, from a sum-capacity/sum-GDoF perspective. To\nthis end, we interpret the explicit characterization of the\nsum-capacity/sum-GDoF of a TIN optimal network (without parallel channels) as a\nminimum weighted matching problem in combinatorial optimization, and obtain a\nsimple characterization in terms of a partition of the interference network\ninto vertex-disjoint cycles. Aided by insights from the cyclic partition, the\nsum-capacity optimality of TIN for $K$ user parallel interference networks is\ncharacterized for the ADT deterministic model, leading ultimately to\ncorresponding GDoF results for the Gaussian setting. In both cases, subject to\na mild invertibility condition the optimality of TIN is shown to extend to\nparallel networks in a separable fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 01:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-14"}

Thanks to\nits simplicity, this model is relevant to various contexts, from industrial\ncontainers (with small oscillations of the rotation rate) to fluid layers of\nterrestial planets (with length-of-day variations). Assuming a multipolar\n$n$-fold boundary deformation, we first obtain the two-dimensional basic flow.\nWe then perform a short-wavelength local stability analysis of the basic flow,\nshowing that an instability may occur in three dimensions. We christen it the\nLibration Driven Multipolar Instability (LDMI). The growth rates of the LDMI\nare computed by a Floquet analysis in a systematic way, and compared to\nanalytical expressions obtained by perturbation methods. We then focus on the\nsimplest geometry allowing the LDMI, a librating deformed cylinder. To take\ninto account viscous and confinement effects, we perform a global stability\nanalysis, which shows that the LDMI results from a parametric resonance of\ninertial modes. Performing numerical simulations of this librating cylinder, we\nconfirm that the basic flow is indeed established and report the first\nnumerical evidence of the LDMI. Numerical results, in excellent agreement with\nthe stability results, are used to explore the non-linear regime of the\ninstability (amplitude and viscous dissipation of the driven flow). We finally\nprovide an example of LDMI in a deformed spherical container to show that the\ninstability mechanism is generic. Our results show that the previously studied\nlibration driven elliptical instability simply corresponds to the particular\ncase $n=2$ of a wider class of instabilities. Summarizing, this work shows that\nany oscillating non-axisymmetric container in rotation may excite intermittent,\nspace-filling LDMI flows, and this instability should thus be easy to observe\nexperimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 07:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Our results indicate that\nunder most nebula conditions `sub-Earth' and Earth-mass planets can lose their\nenvelopes by thermal escape during the first $100$ Myr after the disk\ndissipated. However, if a nebula has a low dust depletion factor or low\naccretion rates resulting in low protoplanetary luminosities, it is possible\nthat even protoplanets with Earth-mass cores may keep their hydrogen envelopes\nduring their whole lifetime. In contrast to lower mass protoplanets,\n`super-Earths' accumulate a huge amount of nebula gas and lose only tiny\nfractions of their primordial envelopes. Our results agree with the fact that\nVenus, Earth, and Mars are not surrounded by dense hydrogen envelopes, as well\nas with the recent discoveries of low density `super-Earths' that most likely\ncould not get rid of their protoatmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 09:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

From a\nBayesian perspective, this task is equivalent to maximum a posteriori\nprobability estimation under a sparsity promoting heavy-tailed prior for the\nparameters of interest. Following a different approach, this paper develops a\nunifying framework of sparse \\emph{variational Bayes} algorithms that employ\nheavy-tailed priors in conjugate hierarchical form to facilitate posterior\ninference. The resulting fully automated variational schemes are first\npresented in a batch iterative form. Then it is shown that by properly\nexploiting the structure of the batch estimation task, new sparse adaptive\nvariational Bayes algorithms can be derived, which have the ability to impose\nand track sparsity during real-time processing in a time-varying environment.\nThe most important feature of the proposed algorithms is that they completely\neliminate the need for computationally costly parameter fine-tuning, a\nnecessary ingredient of sparse adaptive deterministic algorithms. Extensive\nsimulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new\nsparse variational Bayes algorithms against state-of-the-art deterministic\ntechniques for adaptive channel estimation.

In this paper, we show that the lower bound of the\nrepair-cost is achievable for the exact repair of MDS codes in tandem and grid\nnetworks, thus resulting in the minimum-cost exact MDS codes.

We demonstrate\nthat for such shocks, in which the scattering of energetic particles is\nmediated exclusively by ion skin-depth scale structures, as might be expected\nfor a Weibel-mediated shock, there is an intrinsic limit on the maximum energy\nto which particles can be accelerated. This maximum energy is determined from\nthe requirement that particles must be isotropised in the downstream plasma\nframe before the mean field transports them far downstream, and falls\nconsiderably short of what is required to produce ultra-high-energy cosmic\nrays. To circumvent this limit, a highly disorganised field is required on\nlarger scales. The growth of cosmic-ray induced instabilities on wavelengths\nmuch longer than the ion-plasma skin depth, both upstream and downstream of the\nshock, is considered. While these instabilities may play an important role in\nmagnetic field amplification at relativistic shocks, on scales comparable to\nthe gyroradius of the most energetic particles, the calculated growth-rates\nhave insufficient time to modify the scattering. Since strong modification is a\nnecessary condition for particles in the downstream region to re-cross the\nshock, in the absence of an alternative scattering mechanism, these results\nimply that acceleration to higher energies is ruled out.

As a\nresult, the initial potential energy at the entrance of a bending system, which\nwe call pseudo (kinetic) energy, is indistinguishable from the usual kinetic\nenergy offset from the design energy in its perturbation to particle optics\nthrough dispersion and momentum compaction. In this paper, in identifying this\ncentrifugal force on particles as the remnant of the CSR cancellation effect in\ntransverse particle dynamics, we show how the dynamics equation in terms of the\ncanonical momentum for beam motion on a curved orbit is related to the\nPanofsky-Wenzel theorem for wakefields for beam motion on a straight path.

Our analysis shows that their\nTTVs are consistently explained by the three-planet model, and constrains their\nmasses as $M_{\\rm b} = 2.1_{-0.8}^{+1.5} M_{\\oplus}$ (Kepler-51b), $M_{\\rm c} =\n4.0 \\pm 0.4 M_{\\oplus}$ (Kepler-51c), and $M_{02} = 7.6 \\pm 1.1 M_{\\oplus}$\n(KOI-620.02), thus confirming KOI-620.02 as a planet in this system. The masses\ninferred from the TTVs are rather small compared to the planetary radii based\non the stellar density and planet-to-star radius ratios determined from the\ntransit light curves. Combining these estimates, we find that all three planets\nin this system have densities among the lowest determined, $\\rho_p \\lesssim\n0.05\\,{\\rm g\\,cm^{-3}}$.

As a consequence, both the\nlogical content and principles of biology need to be reconsidered. The present\narticle describes an inquiry into the foundations of biology. The foundations\nof biology are built in terms of elements, logic and principles, using both the\nlanguage and the general methods employed in other disciplines.
