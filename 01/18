We here use an ordinary square lattice with the normal periodic\nboundary condition for link-variables $U_\\mu(s)$ in the temporal direction.\nBecause of the factor $\\lambda_n^{N_t -1}$ in the analytical relation, the\ncontribution of low-lying Dirac modes to the Polyakov loop is negligibly small\nin both confined and deconfined phases, while the low-lying Dirac modes are\nessential for chiral symmetry breaking. Also, in lattice QCD simulations, we\nnumerically confirm the analytical relation, non-zero finiteness of $\\langle\nn|\\hat U_4|n \\rangle$ for each Dirac mode, and negligibly small contribution of\nlow-lying Dirac modes to the Polyakov loop. Thus, we conclude that low-lying\nDirac modes are not essential for confinement, which indicates no direct\none-to-one correspondence between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in\nQCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 18:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-20"}

On this basis, we find that i) the observed\nage-metallicity relation is nearly flat in the range of ages between 0 Gyr and\n8 Gyr; ii) at ages older than 9 Gyr, we see a decrease in [Fe/H] and a clear\nabsence of metal-rich stars; this cannot be explained by the survey selection\nfunctions; iii) there is a significant scatter of [Fe/H] at any age; and iv)\n[Mg/Fe] increases with age, but the dispersion of [Mg/Fe] at ages > 9 Gyr is\nnot as small as advocated by some other studies.

Cast in the\nframe of task parallelism, calculations on a spatial domain can be treated as a\ntask. If neighbouring domains interact and share results, access to the\nspecific data needs to be synchronized to avoid race conditions. This is the\ncase for a variety of applications, like most molecular dynamics and many\ncomputational fluid dynamics codes. Here we present an unexpected problem which\ncan occur in dependency-driven task parallelization models like StarSs: the\ntasks accessing a specific spatial domain are treated as interdependent, as\ndependencies are detected automatically via memory addresses. Thus, the order\nin which tasks are generated will have a severe impact on the dependency tree.\nIn the worst case, a complete serialization is reached and no two tasks can be\ncalculated in parallel. We present the problem in detail based on an example\nfrom molecular dynamics, and introduce a theoretical framework to calculate the\ndegree of serialization. Furthermore, we present strategies to avoid this\nunnecessary problem. We recommend treating these strategies as best practice\nwhen using dependency-driven task parallel programming models like StarSs on\nsuch scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 19:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-20"}

As an application, we provide two different\nsets of mass estimators for elliptical galaxies, based on either the velocity\ndispersion at a specific location near the effective radius, or the\naperture-averaged velocity dispersion.

Initially, the analysis of RCs was based on the\nassumption that during the repair process, the newcomer does not distinguish\n(among all surviving nodes) which nodes to access, i.e., the newcomer is\noblivious to the set of helpers being used. Such a scheme is termed the blind\nrepair (BR) scheme. Nonetheless, it is intuitive in practice that the newcomer\nshould choose to access only those \"good\" helpers. In this paper, a new\ncharacterization of the effect of choosing the helper nodes in terms of the\nstorage-bandwidth tradeoff is given. Specifically, answers to the following\nfundamental questions are given: Under what conditions does proactively\nchoosing the helper nodes improve the storage-bandwidth tradeoff? Can this\nimprovement be analytically quantified?\n  This paper answers the former question by providing a necessary and\nsufficient condition under which optimally choosing good helpers strictly\nimproves the storage-bandwidth tradeoff. To answer the latter question, a\nlow-complexity helper selection solution, termed the family repair (FR) scheme,\nis proposed and the corresponding storage/repair-bandwidth curve is\ncharacterized. For example, consider a distributed storage network with 60\ntotal number of nodes and the network is resilient against 50 node failures. If\nthe number of helper nodes is 10, then the FR scheme and its variant\ndemonstrate 27% reduction in the repair-bandwidth when compared to the BR\nsolution. This paper also proves that under some design parameters, the FR\nscheme is indeed optimal among all helper selection schemes. An explicit\nconstruction of an exact-repair code is also proposed that can achieve the\nminimum-bandwidth-regenerating point of the FR scheme. The new exact-repair\ncode can be viewed as a generalization of the existing fractional repetition\ncode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2014 01:51:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 20:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

This topic has\ngained a lot of attention recently. Among others, several factorization methods\nwere proposed to solve the problem, although most of them assume explicit\nfeedback which strongly limits their real-world applicability. While these\nalgorithms apply various loss functions and optimization strategies, the\npreference modeling under context is less explored due to the lack of tools\nallowing for easy experimentation with various models. As context dimensions\nare introduced beyond users and items, the space of possible preference models\nand the importance of proper modeling largely increases.\n  In this paper we propose a General Factorization Framework (GFF), a single\nflexible algorithm that takes the preference model as an input and computes\nlatent feature matrices for the input dimensions. GFF allows us to easily\nexperiment with various linear models on any context-aware recommendation task,\nbe it explicit or implicit feedback based. The scaling properties makes it\nusable under real life circumstances as well.\n  We demonstrate the framework's potential by exploring various preference\nmodels on a 4-dimensional context-aware problem with contexts that are\navailable for almost any real life datasets. We show in our experiments --\nperformed on five real life, implicit feedback datasets -- that proper\npreference modelling significantly increases recommendation accuracy, and\npreviously unused models outperform the traditional ones. Novel models in GFF\nalso outperform state-of-the-art factorization algorithms.\n  We also extend the method to be fully compliant to the Multidimensional\nDataspace Model, one of the most extensive data models of context-enriched\ndata.

These maps in turn are used\nto study the structure of the stars' coronae and winds. This method, however,\nmisses any small-scale magnetic flux whose polarisation signatures cancel out.\nMeasurements of Zeeman broadening show that a large percentage of the surface\nmagnetic flux may be neglected in this way. In this paper we assess the impact\nof this 'missing flux' on the predicted coronal structure and the possible\nrates of spin down due to the stellar wind. To do this we create a model for\nthe small-scale field and add this to the Zeeman-Doppler maps of the magnetic\nfields of a sample of 12 M dwarfs. We extrapolate this combined field and\ndetermine the structure of a hydrostatic, isothermal corona. The addition of\nsmall-scale surface field produces a carpet of low-lying magnetic loops that\ncovers most of the surface, including the stellar equivalent of solar 'coronal\nholes' where the large-scale field is opened up by the stellar wind and hence\nwould be X-ray dark. We show that the trend of the X-ray emission measure with\nrotation rate (the so-called 'activity-rotation relation') is unaffected by the\naddition of small-scale field, when scaled with respect to the large-scale\nfield of each star. The addition of small-scale field increases the surface\nflux; however, the large-scale open flux that governs the loss of mass and\nangular momentum in the wind remains unaffected. We conclude that spin-down\ntimes and mass loss rates calculated from surface magnetograms are unlikely to\nbe significantly influenced by the neglect of small-scale field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2014 14:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The soft hyperon equation of state under consideration is usually treated\nas non-realistic in the standard General Relativity. The numerical analysis of\nMass-Radius relation for massive neutron stars with hyperon equation of state\nin modified gravity turns out to be consistent with observations.

By partitioning the states of the Markov chain into sub-groups (or\nclusters) and then aggregating the states of each cluster as a super state, we\nare able to obtain a limit system of much reduced complexity.
