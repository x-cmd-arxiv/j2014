In this paper we investigate the relationships between the\ncelebrated Good-Turing approach, which is a frequentist nonparametric approach\ndeveloped in the 1940s, and a Bayesian nonparametric approach recently\nintroduced in the literature. Specifically, under the assumption of a two\nparameter Poisson-Dirichlet prior, we show that Bayesian nonparametric\nestimators of discovery probabilities are asymptotically equivalent, for a\nlarge sample size, to suitably smoothed Good-Turing estimators.

Using\ninterferometric observations with a synthesized beam of 0.25\", we find that the\n(10,8) and (9,8) masers originate at the same sky position near IRS1. With\nstrong evidence that the (10,8) and (9,8) masers arise in the same volume, we\ndiscuss the application of pumping models for the simultaneous excitation of\nnonmetastable (J > K) para-ammonia states having the same value of K and\nconsecutive values of J. We also present detections of thermal absorption in\nrotational states ranging in energy from E/k_B ~ 200 K to 2000 K, and several\nnon-detections in higher-energy states. In particular, we describe the\npopulations in eight adjacent rotational states with K=6, including two maser\ntransitions, along with the implications for ortho-ammonia pumping models. An\nexisting torus model for molecular gas in the environment of IRS1 has been\napplied to the masers; a variety of maser species are shown to agree with the\nmodel.

For that reason,\nthere is typically a slight mismatch between the leading logs resummed by those\nevolution equations without finite-energy corrections and the leading logs\nactually present in the perturbative expansion of any observable. That mismatch\nis one of the sources of large corrections at NLO and NLL accuracy.

Considering all three areas, a survey must have sufficient spatial\nresolution to study the tailed galaxies which trace the cluster weather as well\nas the radio lobes driving energy into the cluster from the central AGN. The\nsurvey must also have sensitivity to low surface brightness emission and large\nangular scales to probe radio halos and relics as well as the WHIM residing in\nthe large scale structure filaments.

The\nmost extreme of these hinge clumps have star formation rates of 1 - 9\nM(sun)/yr, comparable to or larger than the `overlap' region of intense star\nformation between the two disks of the colliding galaxy system the Antennae. In\nthe HST images, we have found remarkably large (~70 pc) and luminous (M(I) ~\n12.2 to -16.5) sources at the centers of these hinge clumps, sometimes embedded\nin a linear ridge of fainter star clusters. We have found strong X-ray emission\nfrom several of these hinge clumps. In most cases, this emission is\nwell-resolved with Chandra and has a thermal X-ray spectrum, thus it is likely\ndue to hot gas associated with the star formation. The ratio of the\nextinction-corrected diffuse X-ray luminosity to the mechanical energy rate\n(the X-ray production efficiency) for the hinge clumps is similar to that in\nthe Antennae galaxies, but higher than those for regions in the normal spiral\ngalaxy NGC 2403. Two of the hinge clumps have point-like X-ray emission much\nbrighter than expected for hot gas; these sources are likely `ultra-luminous\nX-ray sources' (ULXs) due to accretion disks around black holes. The most\nextreme of these sources, in Arp 240, has a hard X-ray spectrum and an absorbed\nX-ray luminosity of ~2 X 10^41 erg/s; more than expected by single high mass\nX-ray binaries (HMXBs), thus it may be either a collection of HMXBs or an\nintermediate-mass black hole (>=80 M(sun)).

We present delay times of double-detonation SNe, in which\na sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accretes non-dynamically\nfrom a helium-rich companion. One of the main uncertainties in quantifying SN\nrates from double-detonations is the (assumed) retention efficiency of He-rich\nmatter. Therefore, we implement a new prescription for the treatment of\naccretion/accumulation of He-rich matter on white dwarfs. In addition, we test\nhow the results change depending on which criteria are assumed to lead to a\ndetonation in the helium shell. In comparing the results to our standard case\n(Ruiter et al. 2011), we find that regardless of the adopted He accretion\nprescription, the SN rates are reduced by only 25% if low-mass He shells (<\n0.05 Msun) are sufficient to trigger the detonations. If more massive (0.1\nMsun) shells are needed, the rates decrease by 85% and the delay time\ndistribution is significantly changed in the new accretion model - only SNe\nwith prompt (< 500 Myr) delay times are produced. Since theoretical arguments\nfavour low-mass He shells for normal double-detonation SNe, we conclude that\nthe rates from double-detonations are likely to be high, and should not\ncritically depend on the adopted prescription for accretion of He.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2014 22:32:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 12:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-07"}

We obtained a moderate resolution spectrum of this\ntarget, and classify it as L7pec, confirming its very red nature. Comparison to\ntheoretical models suggests that the object could be a low-gravity L dwarf with\na solar or higher than solar metallicity. Nonetheless, the match of such fits\nto the spectrum is rather poor and this and other peculiar red L dwarfs pose\nnew challenges for the modeling of ultracool atmospheres. We determined the\nproper motion of ULAS J222711-004547 using the data available in the\nliterature, and we find that its kinematics do not suggest membership of any of\nthe known young associations. We show that applying a simple de-reddening curve\nto its spectrum allows it to resemble the spectra of the L7 spectroscopic\nstandards. Given the negligible interstellar reddening of the field containing\nour target, we conclude that the reddening of the spectrum is mostly due to an\nexcess of dust in the photosphere of the target. De-reddening the spectrum\nusing extinction curves for different dust species gives surprisingly good\nresults and suggests a characteristic grain size of $\\sim$0.5 $\\mu$m. We show\nthat by increasing the optical depth, the same extinction curves allow the\nspectrum of ULAS J222711-004547 to resemble the spectra of unusually blue L\ndwarfs and slightly metal-poor L dwarfs. Grains of similar size yield very good\nfits when de-reddening other unusually red L dwarfs in the L5 to L7.5 range.\nThese results suggest that the diversity in near infrared colours and spectra\nseen in late-L dwarfs could be due to differences in the optical thickness of\nthe dust cloud deck.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2014 11:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

A special\nemphasis is put on the differences between conservative and non-conservative\ntransformations. In particular, we show that for the zero initial potential, a\nnon-conservative transformation is always equivalent to a pair of conservative\ntransformations.

A convenient technique where the mixing parameter is\nfitted independently of the eigenphases is developed with iterations of pairs\nof conjugate transformations and applied to the neutron-proton triplet S-D\nscattering matrix, for which exactly-solvable matrix potential models are\nconstructed. For different thresholds, conservative transformations do not seem\nto be able to provide a non-trivial coupling between channels.

The model uses a superposition of gradients of\ndistance functions to directly change the direction of the velocity vector. The\nvelocity is then integrated to obtain the location. The approach differs\nfundamentally from force based models needing only three equations to derive\nthe ODE system, as opposed to four in, e.g., the Social Force Model. Also, as a\nresult, pedestrians are no longer subject to inertia. Several other advantages\nensue: Model induced oscillations are avoided completely since no actual forces\nare present. The derivatives in the equations of motion are smooth and\ntherefore allow the use of fast and accurate high order numerical integrators.\nAt the same time, existence and uniqueness of the solution to the ODE system\nfollow almost directly from the smoothness properties. In addition, we\nintroduce a method to calibrate parameters by theoretical arguments based on\nempirically validated assumptions rather than by numerical tests. These\nparameters, combined with the accurate integration, yield simulation results\nwith no collisions of pedestrians.

Additionally, the strain rate tensor and the gradient of\ntemperature are invariant but, the vorticity and gradient of velocity are\nvariant.
