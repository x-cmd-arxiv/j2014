In this case, one wants to find the ``best\" mapping between these\npolygons, i.e., one that minimizes the maximum angle distortion (the\ndilatation) over \\textit{all} points in $P$. From complex analysis such maps\nare known to exist and are unique. They are called extremal quasiconformal\nmaps, or Teichm\\\"{u}ller maps.\n  Although there are many efficient ways to compute or approximate conformal\nmaps, there is currently no such algorithm for extremal quasiconformal maps.\nThis paper studies the problem of computing extremal quasiconformal maps both\nin the continuous and discrete settings.\n  We provide the first constructive method to obtain the extremal\nquasiconformal map in the continuous setting.

In wireless NCS the\ncommunication between sensors, controllers, and actuators is supported by a\ncommunication channel that is likely to introduce variable communication\ndelays, packet losses, limited bandwidth, and other practical non-idealities\nleading to numerous technical challenges. Although stability properties of NCS\nhave been investigated extensively in the literature, results for NCS under\nmore complex and general objectives, and in particular results dealing with\nverification or controller synthesis for logical specifications, are much more\nlimited. This work investigates how to address such complex objectives by\nconstructively deriving symbolic models of NCS, while encompassing the\nmentioned network non-idealities. The obtained abstracted (symbolic) models can\nthen be employed to synthesize hybrid controllers enforcing rich logical\nspecifications over the concrete NCS models.

In this work the problem of predicting collaborations is addressed\nwhile modeling the collaboration network as a hypergraph network. The problem\nof predicting future multi-actor collaboration is mapped to hyperedge\nprediction problem. Given that the higher order edge prediction is an\ninherently hard problem, in this work we restrict to the task of predicting\nedges (collaborations) that have already been observed in past. In this work,\nwe propose a novel use of hyperincidence temporal tensors to capture time\nvarying hypergraphs and provides a tensor decomposition based prediction\nalgorithm. We quantitatively compare the performance of the hypergraphs based\napproach with the conventional dyadic graph based approach. Our hypothesis that\nhypergraphs preserve the information that simple graphs destroy is corroborated\nby experiments using author collaboration network from the DBLP dataset.

However, simulations that include\nRayleigh friction invariably produce a sub-rotating (retrograde) equatorial jet\nfor Jovian parameter regimes, whilst observations of Jupiter show a\nsuper-rotating (prograde) equatorial jet that has persisted over several\ndecades. Super-rotating equatorial jets have recently been obtained in shallow\nwater simulations that include a Newtonian relaxation of perturbations to the\nlayer thickness to model radiative cooling to space, and in simulations of the\nthermal shallow water equations that include a similar relaxation term in their\ntemperature equation. Simulations of global quasigeostrophic forms of these\ndifferent models produce equatorial jets in the same directions as the parent\nmodels, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for setting the direction\nlies within quasigeostrophic theory. We provide such a mechanism by calculating\nthe effective force acting on the thickness-weighted zonal mean flow due to the\ndecay of an equatorially trapped Rossby wave. Decay due to Newtonian cooling\ncreates an eastward zonal mean flow at the equator, consistent with the\nformation of a super-rotating equatorial jet, while decay due to Rayleigh\nfriction leads to a westward zonal mean flow at the equator, consistent with\nthe formation of a sub-rotating equatorial jet. In both cases the meridionally\nintegrated zonal mean of the absolute zonal momentum is westward, consistent\nwith the standard result that Rossby waves carry westward pseudomomentum, but\nthis does not preclude the zonal mean flow being eastward on and close to the\nequator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 17:25:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 16:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-05"}

Traditional\ntopology optimization methods aim at finding the conceptual design but often\nlack a sufficient resolution of the geometry and structural response, needed to\ndirectly use the optimized design for manufacturing. To overcome these\nlimitations, this paper studies the viability and characteristics of the\neXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) in combination with the Level-Set Method\n(LSM) for topology optimization of three dimensional structural design\nproblems. The LSM describes the geometry by defining the nodal level set values\nvia explicit functions of the optimization variables. The structural response\nis predicted by a generalized version of the XFEM. The LSM-XFEM approach is\ncompared against results from a traditional Solid Isotropic Material with\nPenalization (SIMP) method for two-phase ``solid-void'' and ``solid-solid''\nproblems. The numerical results demonstrate that the LSM-XFEM approach can\ndescribe crisply the geometry and predict the structural response of complex\nthree-dimensional structures with acceptable accuracy even on coarse meshes.\nHowever, the LSM-XFEM studied here lacks a robust and intuitive formulation to\ncontrol the minimum feature size, and the optimization results may depend on\nthe initial design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2014 00:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

In this paper we consider a ``pull'' strategy, where every\nuser maintains a request queue, such that users keep track of the video chunks\nthat are effectively delivered. The pull scheme allows to download the chunks\nin the playback order without skipping or missing them. In addition, motivated\nby the recent/forthcoming progress in small cell networks (e.g., in wave-2 of\nthe recent IEEE 802.11ac standard), we extend our dynamic streaming approach to\nthe case of base stations capable of multiuser MIMO downlink, i.e., serving\nmultiple users on the same time-frequency slot by spatial multiplexing.

This method is based upon\ntools from hypergraph theory. The deletion channel is represented by a\nhypergraph whose edges are the deletion balls (or spheres), so that a\ndeletion-correcting code becomes a matching in this hypergraph. Consequently, a\nbound on the size of such a code can be obtained from bounds on the matching\nnumber of a hypergraph. Classical results in hypergraph theory are then invoked\nto compute an upper bound on the matching number as a solution to a\nlinear-programming problem.\n  The method by Kulkarni and Kiyavash can be applied not only for the deletion\nchannel but also for other error channels. This paper studies this method in\nits most general setup. First, it is shown that if the error channel is regular\nand symmetric then this upper bound coincides with the sphere packing bound and\nthus is called the generalized sphere packing bound. Even though this bound is\nexplicitly given by a linear programming problem, finding its exact value may\nstill be a challenging task. In order to simplify the complexity of the\nproblem, we present a technique based upon graph automorphisms that in many\ncases reduces the number of variables and constraints in the problem. We then\napply this method on specific examples of error channels. We start with the $Z$\nchannel and show how to exactly find the generalized sphere packing bound for\nthis setup. Next studied is the non-binary limited magnitude channel both for\nsymmetric and asymmetric errors, where we focus on the single-error case. We\nfollow up on the deletion and grain-error channels and show how to improve upon\nthe existing upper bounds for single deletion/error. Finally, we apply this\nmethod for projective spaces and find its generalized sphere packing bound for\nthe single-error case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2014 04:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

In addition, existing approaches do\nnot take into account uncertainty information of latent factors, as well as\nmissing entries. To address these issues, we formulate CP factorization using a\nhierarchical probabilistic model and employ a fully Bayesian treatment by\nincorporating a sparsity-inducing prior over multiple latent factors and the\nappropriate hyperpriors over all hyperparameters, resulting in automatic rank\ndetermination. To learn the model, we develop an efficient deterministic\nBayesian inference algorithm, which scales linearly with data size.

The use of a virtual staggered structure arrangement, which stores all\nthe variables at the same physical location and employs only one set of nodes\nusing virtual interpolation points, reduces the geometrical complexity. The\nvirtual staggered structure consists of the virtual interpolation points and\nthe virtual local stencil. Also, computational enhancement of the virtual\ninterpolation point method is considerable since the present method directly\ndiscretizes the strong forms of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations\nwithout numerical integration. It makes a key difference from others. In the\nvirtual interpolation point method, the choice of an accurate interpolation\nscheme satisfying the spatial approximation in the complex domain is important\nbecause there is the virtual staggered structure for computation of the\nvelocities and pressure since there is no explicit staggered structure for\nstability.

In this paper, they\nare simply interpreted by the same mechanism, residual Doppler shift. In a\nbinary system with periodic signals sending to an observer, the drift of the\nsignal frequency actually changes with the varying orbital velocity, projected\nto line of sight at different phases of orbit. And it has been taken for\ngranted that the net red-shift and blue-shift of an full orbit circle be\ncancelled out, so that the effect of Doppler shift to the signal in binary\nmotion cannot be accumulated over the orbital period.

We examine\nthis picture using multi-wavelength observations of the early phase of an\nM-class flare SOL2010-08-07T18:24. We aim to determine the properties of the\nheated plasma in the flare ribbons, and to understand the partition of the\npower input into radiative and conductive losses. Using GOES, SDO/EVE, SDO/AIA\nand RHESSI we measure the temperature, emission measure and differential\nemission measure of the flare ribbons, and deduce approximate density values.\nThe non-thermal emission measure, and the collisional thick target energy input\nto the ribbons are obtained from RHESSI using standard methods. We deduce the\nexistence of a substantial amount of plasma at 10 MK in the flare ribbons,\nduring the pre-impulsive and early-impulsive phase of the flare. The average\ncolumn emission measure of this hot component is a few times 10^28/cm^5, and we\ncan calculate that its predicted conductive losses dominate its measured\nradiative losses. If the power input to the hot ribbon plasma is due to\ncollisional energy deposition by an electron beam from the corona then a\nlow-energy cutoff of around 5 keV is necessary to balance the conductive\nlosses, implying a very large electron energy content. Independent of the\nstandard collisional thick-target electron beam interpretation, the observed\nnon-thermal X-rays can be provided if one electron in 10^3 - 10^4 in the 10 MK\n(1 keV) ribbon plasma has an energy above 10 keV. We speculate that this could\narise if a non-thermal tail is generated in the ribbon plasma which is being\nheated by other means, for example by waves or turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2014 14:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

During each crossing of the instability strip the period of\nradial pulsations is a quadratic function of the stellar evolution time.\nTheoretical rates of the pulsation period change agree with observations but\nthe scatter of observational estimates of dP/dt noticeably exceeds the width of\nthe band (\\delta\\log |dP/dt| <= 0.6) confining evolutionary tracks in the\nperiod - period change rate diagram. One of the causes of the large scatter\nwith very high values of dP/dt in Cepheids with increasing periods might be the\nstars that cross the instability strip for the first time. Their fraction\nranges from 2% for Mzams=5.5M_\\odot to 9% for Mzams=13M_\\odot. Variable stars\n\\alpha UMi and IX Cas seem to belong to such objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2014 15:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-24"}
