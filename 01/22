In\norder to preserve the Hermiticity of the operators, we use the Heisenberg and\nSchroedinger uncertainty relations to derive expressions for the phase\nuncertainty from generalised Susskind-Glogower operators. This formalism not\nonly offers the possibility of directly measuring quantum phase uncertainties\nin a cavity-QED experiment but also gives a significant computational saving\nover the quantum Fisher information approach, which requires diagonalisation of\nthe density matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 16:02:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 12:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-02"}

The delay effect results as the system passes\nslowly from a stable to an unstable regime, and was previously analysed in the\ncontext of ODE's in [P.Mandel, T.Erneux, J.Stat.Phys, 1987]. It was found that\nthe instability would not be fully realized until the system had entered well\ninto the unstable regime. The bifurcation is said to have been \"delayed\"\nrelative to the threshold value computed directly from a linear stability\nanalysis. In contrast, we analyze the delay effect in systems of PDE's. In\nparticular, for spike solutions of singularly perturbed generalized\nGierer-Meinhardt (GM) and Gray-Scott (GS) models, we analyze three examples of\ndelay resulting from slow passage into regimes of oscillatory and competition\ninstability. In the first example, for the GM model on the infinite real line,\nwe analyze the delay resulting from slowly tuning a control parameter through a\nHopf bifurcation. In the second example, we consider a Hopf bifurcation on a\nfinite one-dimensional domain. In this scenario, as opposed to the extrinsic\ntuning of a system parameter through a bifurcation value, we analyze the delay\nof a bifurcation triggered by slow intrinsic dynamics of the PDE system. In the\nthird example, we consider competition instabilities of the GS model triggered\nby the extrinsic tuning of a feed rate parameter. In all cases, we find that\nthe system must pass well into the unstable regime before the onset of\ninstability is fully observed, indicating delay. We also find that delay has an\nimportant effect on the eventual dynamics of the system in the unstable regime.\nWe give analytic predictions for the magnitude of the delays as obtained\nthrough analysis of certain explicitly solvable nonlocal eigenvalue problems.\nThe theory is confirmed by numerical solutions of the full PDE systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 16:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The research\nis explicitly carried out on arbitrarily varying quantum channels (AVQCs). We\ngive an explicit example that answers the recent question whether the\ntransmission of messages over AVQCs can benefit from distribution of randomness\nbetween the legitimate sender and receiver in the affirmative. The specific\nclass of channels introduced in that example is then extended to show that the\ndeterministic capacity does have discontinuity points, while that behaviour is,\nat the same time, not generic: We show that it is continuous around its\npositivity points. This is in stark contrast to the randomness-assisted\ncapacity, which is always continuous in the channel. Our results imply that the\ndeterministic message transmission capacity of an AVQC can be discontinuous\nonly in points where it is zero, while the randomness assisted capacity is\nnonzero. Apart from the zero-error capacities, this is the first result that\nshows a discontinuity of a capacity for a large class of quantum channels. The\ncontinuity of the respective capacity for memoryless quantum channels had,\namong others, been listed as an open problem on the problem page of the ITP\nHannover for about six years before it was proven to be continuous. We also\nquantify the interplay between the distribution of finite amounts of randomness\nbetween the legitimate sender and receiver, the (nonzero) decoding error with\nrespect to the average error criterion that can be achieved over a finite\nnumber of channel uses and the number of messages that can be sent. This part\nof our results also applies to entanglement- and strong subspace transmission.\nIn addition, we give a new sufficient criterion for the entanglement\ntransmission capacity with randomness assistance to vanish.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 16:03:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 17:05:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 10:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In concrete, we\nconstruct (i) a variational iterative regularizing ensemble Levenberg-Marquardt\nmethod (IR-enLM) and (ii) a derivative-free iterative ensemble Kalman smoother\n(IR-ES). The aim of these methods is to provide a robust ensemble approximation\nof the Bayesian posterior. The proposed methods are based on fundamental ideas\nfrom iterative regularization methods that have been widely used for the\nsolution of deterministic inverse problems [21]. In this work we are interested\nin the application of the proposed ensemble methods for the solution of\nBayesian inverse problems that arise in reservoir modeling applications. The\nproposed ensemble methods use key aspects of the regularizing\nLevenberg-Marquardt scheme developed by Hanke [16] and that we recently applied\nfor history matching in [18].\n  In the case where the forward operator is linear and the prior is Gaussian,\nwe show that the proposed IR-enLM and IR-ES coincide with standard randomized\nmaximum likelihood (RML) and the ensemble smoother (ES) respectively. For the\ngeneral nonlinear case, we develop a numerical framework to assess the\nperformance of the proposed ensemble methods at capturing the posterior. This\nframework consists of using a state-of-the art MCMC method for resolving the\nBayesian posterior from synthetic experiments. The resolved posterior via MCMC\nthen provides a gold standard against to which compare the proposed IR-enLM and\nIR-ES. We show that for the careful selection of regularization parameters,\nrobust approximations of the posterior can be accomplished in terms of mean and\nvariance.

The widths of spiral arms increase with distance from the\nGalactic center. Fitting axially symmetric models of the Milky Way with the 3-D\nposition and velocity information and conservative priors for the solar and\naverage source peculiar motions, we estimate the distance to the Galactic\ncenter, Ro, to be 8.34 +/- 0.16 kpc, a circular rotation speed at the Sun, To,\nto be 240 +/- 8 km/s, and a rotation curve that is nearly flat (a slope of -0.2\n+/- 0.4 km/s/kpc) between Galactocentric radii of 5 and 16 kpc.

Utterance\nverification in this work implies the ability to determine when portions of a\nhypothesized word string correspond to incorrectly decoded vocabulary words or\nout-of-vocabulary words that may appear in an utterance. This capability is\nimplemented here as a likelihood ratio (LR). There are two UV techniques that\nare presented here. The first is voice verification along with the vocabulary\ntesting, at the same time the parameters for UV models are generated based on\nthe optimization criterion which is directly related to the LR measure. The\nsecond technique is a pitch recognition based on weighted finite-state\ntransducers. These transducers provide a common and natural representation for\nmajor components of speech recognition systems, including hidden Markov models\n(HMMs), context-dependency models, pronunciation dictionaries, statistical\ngrammars, and word or phone lattices. The finite state machine processes the\nacoustic parameters of UV models. The results of an experimental study\npresented in the paper shows that LR based parameter estimation results in a\nsignificant improvement in UV performance for this task. The study also found\nthat the use of the LR based weighted finite-state transducers along with the\nUV, can provide as much as an 11% improvement in UV performance when compared\nto existing UV procedures. Finally, it was also found that the performance of\nthe finite state machine was highly dependent on the use of the LR criterion in\ntraining acoustic models. Several observations are made in the paper concerning\nthe formation of confidence measures for UV and the interaction of these\ntechniques with statistical language models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 16:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-22"}

The governing linear equations and appropriate boundary conditions,\nincluding gravitational terms, are derived and applied to the case of the RTI\nin a single interface between two partially ionized plasmas. The boundary\nconditions lead to an equation for the frequencies in which some of them have\npositive complex parts, marking the appearance of the RTI.

In the classical stability regime the growth\nrate is small, since the collisions prevent the neutral fluid to fully develop\nthe RTI. For parameters in the classical instability regime the growth rate is\nlowered, but for the considered theoretical values of the collision frequencies\nand diffusion coefficients for solar prominences the differences with the\ncompressible MHD case are small. We conclude that PI modifies some aspects of\nthe linear RTI instability, since it takes into account that neutrals do not\nfeel the stabilizing effect of the magnetic field.

This motivates us to address the issue of writing the\ntransition rate ($w_j$) in a best possible linear form such that the mean\nsquared error in satisfying the detailed balance condition is least. The\nadvantage of this work is that, by studying the LGM analytically, we will be\nable to anticipate how the kinetic properties of an arbitrary Ising system\ndepend on the temperature and the coupling constants. The analytical\nexpressions for the optimal values of the parameters involved in the linear\n$w_j$ are obtained using a simple Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse matrix. This\napproach is quite general, in principle applicable to any system and can\nreproduce the exact results for one dimensional Ising system.

In case the curvature is\nstrictly positive, the prototype is the well known Nadel vanishing theorem,\nwhich is itself a generalized analytic version of the fundamental\nKawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem of algebraic geometry. We are interested\nhere in the case where the curvature is merely semipositive in the sense of\ncurrents, and the base manifold is not necessarily projective. In this\nsituation, one can still obtain interesting information on cohomology, e.g. a\nHard Lefschetz theorem with pseudoeffective coefficients, in the form of a\nsurjectivity statement for the Lefschetz map. More recently, Junyan Cao, in his\nPhD thesis defended in Grenoble, obtained a general K{\\\"a}hler vanishing\ntheorem that depends on the concept of numerical dimension of a given\npseudoeffective line bundle. The proof of these results depends in a crucial\nway on a general approximation result for closed (1,1)-currents, based on the\nuse of Bergman kernels, and the related intersection theory of currents.\nAnother important ingredient is the recent proof by Guan and Zhou of the strong\nopenness conjecture. As an application, we discuss a structure theorem for\ncompact K{\\\"a}hler threefolds without nontrivial subvarieties, following a\njoint work with F.Campana and M.Verbitsky.

These difficulties arise from the\nvery uncertain nature of sub-grid physical energy feedback within models,\naffecting both star formation rates and chemical enrichment. To avoid these\nproblems, we have introduced a new approach which consists of fusing disc\nchemical evolution models with compatible numerical simulations. We demonstrate\nthe power of this method by showing that a range of observational results can\nbe explained by our new model. We show that due to radial migration from\nmergers at high redshift and the central bar at later times, a sizable fraction\nof old metal-poor, high-[alpha/Fe] stars can reach the solar vicinity. This\nnaturally accounts for a number of recent observations related to both the thin\nand thick discs, despite the fact that we use thin-disc chemistry only. Within\nthe framework of our model, the MW thick disc has emerged naturally from (i)\nstars born with high velocity dispersions at high redshift, (ii) stars\nmigrating from the inner disc very early on due to strong merger activity, and\n(iii) further radial migration driven by the bar and spirals at later times.

The current\ntheoretical model for this pollution is accretion of rocky bodies delivered to\nthe WD through perturbations by orbiting planets. Using N-body simulations, we\nexamine the possibility of a single planet as the source of pollution. We\ndetermine the stability of test particles on circular orbits in systems with a\nsingle planet located at 4 au for a range of masses and eccentricities,\ncomparing the fractions that are ejected and accreted. In particular, we\ncompare the instabilities that develop before and after the star loses mass to\nform a WD, a process which causes orbiting bodies to migrate outward. We\ndetermine that a planet must be eccentric (e > 0.02) to deliver significant (>\n0.5 per cent) amounts of material to the host and that the amount increases\nwith the planetary eccentricity. This result is robust with respect to the\ninitial eccentricities of the particles for planetary eccentricity above ~0.4\nand for randomly-distributed particle long. of pericentre. We also find that\nthe efficiency of pollution is enhanced as planetary mass is reduced. We\ndemonstrate that a 0.03 M_Jup planet with substantial eccentricity (e > 0.4)\ncan account for the observed levels of pollution for initial disc masses of\norder 1 M_Earth. Such discs are within the range estimated for initial\nplanetesimals discs and below that estimated for the solar system. However,\ntheir survival to the WD stage is uncertain as estimates for the collisional\nevolution of planetesimal discs suggest they should be ground down below the\nrequired levels on Gyr timescales. Thus, planetary scattering by eccentric,\nsub-Jovian planets can explain the observed levels of WD pollution, but only if\ncurrent estimates of the collisional erosion of planetesimal discs are in\nerror.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 21:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Such a\npopulation could provide clues to the origins of SMBHs and to secular pathways\nfor their growth. Using the all-sky Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)\nsurvey, and bulge-to-disk decompositions from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) Data Release 7, we report the discovery of a population of local (z<0.3)\nbulgeless disk galaxies with extremely red mid-infrared colors highly\nsuggestive of a dominant active galactic nucleus (AGN), despite having no\noptical AGN signatures in their SDSS spectra. Using various mid-infrared\nselection criteria from the literature, there are between 30 to over 300\nbulgeless galaxies with possible AGNs. Other known scenarios that can heat the\ndust to high temperatures do not appear to explain the observed colors of this\nsample. If these galaxies are confirmed to host AGNs, this study will provide a\nbreakthrough in characterizing the properties of SMBHs in the low bulge mass\nregime and in understanding their relation with their host galaxies.\nMid-infrared selection identifies AGNs that dominate their host galaxy's\nemission and therefore reveal a different AGN population than is uncovered by\noptical studies. We find that the fraction of all galaxies identified as\ncandidate AGNs by WISE is highest at lower stellar masses and drops\ndramatically in higher mass galaxies, in striking contrast to the findings from\noptical studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 21:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We argue\nthat for a generic doping in this range, superconductivity at weak coupling is\nof Kohn-Luttinger type, and, due to the presence of electronic interactions\nbeyond on-site repulsion, is a threshold phenomenon, with superconductivity\nemerging only if the attraction generated by the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism\nexceeds the bare repulsion in some channel. For disconnected Fermi pockets, we\npredict that Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity, if it occurs, is likely to be\n$f$-wave. While the Kohn-Luttinger analysis is adequate over most of the doping\nrange, a more sophisticated analysis is needed near Van Hove doping. We treat\nVan Hove doping using a parquet renormalization group, the equations for which\nwe derive and analyze. Near this doping level, superconductivity is a universal\nphenomenon, arising from any choice of bare repulsive interactions. The\nstrongest pairing instability is into a chiral $d-$wave state ($d+id$). At a\ntruly weak coupling, the strongest competitor is a spin-density-wave\ninstability, however, $d-$wave superconductivity still wins. Moreover, the\nfeedback of the spin density fluctuations into the Cooper channel significantly\nenhances the critical temperature over the estimates of the Kohn Luttinger\ntheory. We analyze renormalization group equations at stronger couplings and\nfind that the main competitor to $d-$wave supoerconductivity away from weak\ncoupling is actually ferromagnetism.

These BBN results are compared to those derived independently\nfrom the Planck CMB data. In the absence of a light WIMP (chi), N_eff = 3.05(1\n+ Delta N_nu/3). In this case, there is excellent agreement between BBN and the\nCMB, but the joint fit finds that Delta N_nu = 0.40 +/- 0.17, disfavoring\nstandard big bang nucleosynthesis (SBBN: Delta N_nu = 0) at 2.4 sigma, as well\nas a sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1) at 3.5 sigma. In the presence of a light\nWIMP, the relation between N_eff and Delta N_nu depends on the WIMP mass,\nleading to degeneracies among N_eff, Delta N_nu, and m_chi. The complementary\nand independent BBN and CMB data can break some of these degeneracies.\nDepending on the nature of the light WIMP (Majorana or Dirac fermion, real or\ncomplex scalar) the joint BBN + CMB analyses set a lower bound to m_chi in the\nrange from 0.5 to 5 MeV, and they identify best fit values for m_chi in the\nrange from 5 to 10 MeV.

The simplification of using pure dark\nmatter simulations reduces the concentration further, but increases the\ninternal structure, and results in a more prolate stellar halo.

LU elimination steps can be very\nefficiently parallelized, and are twice as cheap in terms of floating- point\noperations, as QR steps. However, LU steps are not necessarily stable, while QR\nsteps are always stable. The hybrid algorithms execute a QR step when a\nrobustness criterion detects some risk for instability, and they execute an LU\nstep otherwise. Ideally, the choice between LU and QR steps must have a small\ncomputational overhead and must provide a satisfactory level of stability with\nas few QR steps as possible.

Starting with the visions and requirements of 5G\nmulti-tier networks, this article outlines the challenges of interference\nmanagement (e.g., power control, cell association) in these networks with\nshared spectrum access (i.e., when the different network tiers shares the same\nlicensed spectrum). It is argued that the existing interference management\nschemes will not be able to address the interference management problem in\nprioritized 5G multi-tier networks where users in different tiers have\ndifferent priorities for channel access. In this context, a survey and\nqualitative comparison of the potential existing cell association and power\ncontrol schemes is provided to demonstrate their limitations for interference\nmanagement in 5G networks. Open challenges are highlighted and guidelines are\nprovided to modify the existing schemes in order to overcome these limitations\nand make them suitable for the emerging 5G systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 00:54:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 04:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The maximum attainable dust mass in this\nprocess is the cause of the bend-over of the relation. A high dust-formation\nefficiency, a bottom-light initial mass function, and negligible supernova\nshock dust destruction are required to produce sufficiently high dust masses.\n(2) A quiescent star-forming phase in which the subsequent parallel decline in\ndust mass and SFR gives rise to the Mdust-SFR relation, through astration and\ndust destruction. The dust-to-gas ratio is approximately constant along the\nrelation. We show that the power-law slope of the Mdust-SFR relation is\ninversely proportional to the global Schmidt-Kennicutt law exponent (i.e.,\n$\\sim 0.9$) in simple chemical evolution models. (3) A quenching phase which\ncauses star formation to drop while the dust mass stays roughly constant or\ndrops proportionally.

Interestingly, since Kuffler's\npioneering experiments on retinal ganglion cells, mathematical models have been\nvital for advancing our understanding of the receptive fields of visual\nneurons. However, existing models were not designed to describe the most\nsalient attributes of the highly specialized neurons in the V1 to MT motion\nprocessing stream; and they have not been able to do so. Here, we introduce the\nGabor-Einstein wavelet, a new family of functions for representing the\nreceptive fields of V1 to MT neurons. We show that the way space and time are\nmixed in the visual cortex is analogous to the way they are mixed in the\nspecial theory of relativity (STR). Hence we constrained the Gabor-Einstein\nmodel by requiring: (i) relativistic-invariance of the wave carrier, and (ii)\nthe minimum possible number of parameters. From these two constraints, the sinc\nfunction emerged as a natural descriptor of the wave carrier. The particular\ndistribution of lowpass to bandpass temporal frequency filtering properties of\nV1 to MT neurons (Foster et al 1985; DeAngelis et al 1993b; Hawken et al 1996)\nis clearly explained by the Gabor-Einstein basis. Furthermore, it does so in a\nmanner innately representative of the motion-processing stream's neuronal\nhierarchy. Our analysis and computer simulations show that the distribution of\ntemporal frequency filtering properties along the motion processing stream is a\ndirect effect of the way the brain jointly encodes space and time. We uncovered\nthis fundamental link by demonstrating that analogous mathematical structures\nunderlie STR and joint cortical spacetime encoding.

These molecules include CO, SiS and O2. Dust clusters are destroyed by the\nreverse shock and do not reform in the post-reverse shock gas, even for the\nhighest gas density.

We find that a pure size evolution, even mild, is ruled out for\nour galaxies since it would lead them away from both the Kormendy and the\nsize-mass relation. If an evolution of the effective radius takes place, this\nmust be compensated by an increase in the luminosity, hence of the stellar mass\nof the galaxies, to keep them on the local relations. We show that to follow\nthe Kormendy relation, the stellar mass must increase as the effective radius.\nHowever, this mass growth is not sufficient to keep the galaxies on the\nsize-mass relation for the same variation in effective radius. Thus, if we want\nto preserve the Kormendy relation, we fail to satisfy the size-mass relation\nand vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 09:51:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 13:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 12:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

Often mixed up\nwith other system attributes; traditionally used with different meanings in as\nmany different disciplines; sought or applied through diverse approaches in\nvarious application domains, resilience in fact is a multi-attribute property\nthat implies a number of constitutive abilities. To further complicate the\nmatter, resilience is not an absolute property but rather it is the result of\nthe match between a system, its current condition, and the environment it is\nset to operate in. In this paper we discuss this problem and provide a\ndefinition of resilience as a property measurable as a system-environment fit.\nThis brings to the foreground the dynamic nature of resilience as well as its\nhard dependence on the context. A major problem becomes then that, being a\ndynamic figure, resilience cannot be assessed in absolute terms. As a way to\npartially overcome this obstacle, in this paper we provide a number of\nindicators of the quality of resilience. Our focus here is that of collective\nsystems, namely those systems resulting from the union of multiple individual\nparts, sub-systems, or organs. Through several examples of such systems we\nobserve how our indicators provide insight, at least in the cases at hand, on\ndesign flaws potentially affecting the efficiency of the resilience strategies.\nA number of conjectures are finally put forward to associate our indicators\nwith factors affecting the quality of resilience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 10:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-23"}

This is used in conjunction with a calculation of\nthermodynamic parameters of the system, including the temperature dependent\nsensible enthalpy, configurational entropy and vibrational entropy of the\ndifferent crystals in the system, developed from phonon density of states. It\nwas found that precipitation of hydrides is not thermodynamically favourable\nfor Zr-H solid solutions containing less than 300 ppm H, suggesting that a\nmechanism must cause local concentration of H atoms to a greater amount than\nfound globally in experimental samples containing hydrides. Temperature drives\nthe reaction in the direction of solution, primarily due to entropic effects.\nGenerally, {\\gamma} hydride is the most stable phase, although it is very close\nin energy to the {\\delta}-phase. The sensible enthalpy of precipitation assists\nin stabilising HCP hydrides, and the configurational entropy change during\nprecipitation favours FCC hydrides. None of the thermodynamic contributions are\nfound to be negligible in driving precipitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 11:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

The useful information in the documents can\nbe accompanied by a large amount of noise words when using Full Text\nRepresentation, and therefore will affect negatively the result of the\nclustering process. So it is with great need to eliminate the noise words and\nkeeping just the useful information in order to enhance the quality of the\nclustering results. This problem occurs with different degree for any language\nsuch as English, European, Hindi, Chinese, and Arabic Language. To overcome\nthis problem, in this paper, we propose a new and efficient Keyphrases\nextraction method based on the Suffix Tree data structure (KpST), the extracted\nKeyphrases are then used in the clustering process instead of Full Text\nRepresentation. The proposed method for Keyphrases extraction is language\nindependent and therefore it may be applied to any language. In this\ninvestigation, we are interested to deal with the Arabic language which is one\nof the most complex languages. To evaluate our method, we conduct an\nexperimental study on Arabic Documents using the most popular Clustering\napproach of Hierarchical algorithms: Agglomerative Hierarchical algorithm with\nseven linkage techniques and a variety of distance functions and similarity\nmeasures to perform Arabic Document Clustering task. The obtained results show\nthat our method for extracting Keyphrases increases the quality of the\nclustering results.

MAGIC observed FSRQ PKS 1510-089 in February-April 2012 during a high\nactivity state in the high energy (HE, E>100 MeV) gamma-ray band observed by\nAGILE and Fermi. MAGIC observations result in the detection of a source with\nsignificance of 6.0 sigma. In agreement with the previous VHE observations of\nthe source, we find no statistically significant variability during the MAGIC\nobservations in daily, weekly or monthly time scales. The other two known VHE\nFSRQs have shown daily scale to sub-hour variability.\n  We study the multifrequency behaviour of the source at the epoch of MAGIC\nobservation, collecting quasi-simultaneous data at radio and optical (GASP-WEBT\nand F-Gamma collaborations, REM, Steward, Perkins, Liverpool, OVRO and VLBA\ntelescopes), X-ray (Swift satellite) and HE gamma-ray frequencies. The\ngamma-ray SED combining AGILE, Fermi and MAGIC data joins smoothly and shows no\nhint of a break. The multifrequency light curves suggest a common origin for\nthe millimeter radio and HE gamma-ray emission and the HE gamma-ray flaring\nstarts when the new component is ejected from the 43GHz VLBA core. The\nquasi-simultaneous multifrequency SED is modelled with a one-zone inverse\nCompton model. We study two different origins of the seed photons for the\ninverse Compton scattering, namely the infra-red torus and a slow sheath\nsurrounding the jet around the VLBA core. Both models fit the data well.\nHowever, the fast HE gamma-ray variability requires that within the modelled\nlarge emitting region, there must exist more compact regions. We suggest that\nthese observed signatures would be most naturally explained by a turbulent\nplasma flowing at a relativistic speed down the jet and crossing a standing\nconical shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 12:57:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 09:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In this paper, we\npropose a centrality measure for temporal networks based on random walks which\nwe call TempoRank.

The stationary density also\ndepends on the sojourn probability q which regulates the tendency of the walker\nto stay in the node. We apply our method to human interaction networks and show\nthat although it is important for a node to be connected to another node with\nmany random walkers at the right moment (one of the principles of the\nPageRank), this effect is negligible in practice when the time order of link\nactivation is included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 13:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-17"}

This approach suffers from several problems. Firstly, how is estimation\nerror to be quantified, and then taken into account when making statements\nabout the future behaviour of the observed time series? Secondly, decisions may\nbe taken today committing to future actions over some quite long horizon, as in\nthe trading of derivatives; if the model is re-estimated at some intermediate\ntime, our earlier decisions would need to be revised - but the derivative has\nalready been traded at the earlier price. Thirdly, the exact form of the\nparametric model to be used is generally taken as given at the outset; other\ncompetitor models might possibly work better in some circumstances, but the\nmethodology does not allow them to be factored into the inference. What we\npropose here is a very simple (Bayesian) alternative approach to inference and\naction in financial econometrics which deals decisively with all these issues.\nThe key feature is that nothing is being estimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 13:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-23"}

These sources exhibit X-ray spectra\nthat show curvature above 2 keV and the same is likely true of HMXB populations\nat high redshifts. The spectral curvature changes the K-correction for X-rays\nfrom HMXBs in a manner that weakens the constraints on X-ray emission of early\nHMXBs obtained from the soft X-ray background. Applied to deep X-ray surveys of\nstar forming galaxies, the modified K-correction suggests a moderate increase\nin the ratio of X-ray luminosity to star formation rate at intermediate\nredshifts, z=3-5, and is consistent with a large enhancement at high redshifts,\nz=6-7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 14:45:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2014 20:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

While the\nconventional minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator has cubic complexity in\nthe dimension of the covariance matrices, due to an inversion operation, our\nproposed estimators significantly reduce this to square complexity by\napproximating the inverse by a L-degree matrix polynomial.

However, many\ndifferent methods have been used in these studies to identify excellent papers.\nThe present quantitative analysis of the literature has been carried out in\norder to acquire an overview of these methods and an indication of an \"average\"\nor \"most frequent\" bibliometric practice. The search in the Web of Science\nyielded 321 papers dealing with \"highly cited\", \"most cited\", \"top cited\" and\n\"most frequently cited\". Of the 321 papers, 16 could not be used in this study.\nIn around 80% of the papers analyzed in this study, a quantitative definition\nhas been provided with which to identify excellent papers. With definitions\nwhich relate to an absolute number, either a certain number of top cited papers\n(58%) or papers with a minimum number of citations are selected (17%). Around\n23% worked with percentile rank classes. Over these papers, there is an\narithmetic average of the top 7.6% (arithmetic average) or of the top 3%\n(median). The top 1% is used most frequently in the papers, followed by the top\n10%. With the thresholds presented in this study, in future, it will be\npossible to identify excellent papers based on an \"average\" or \"most frequent\"\npractice among bibliometricians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 12:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-24"}

Autonomic, electroencephalographic (EEG), and heart\nrate variability (HRV) metrics were recorded while participants (N = 15) played\nflutes and listened to several styles of music. Flute playing was accompanied\nby an 84% increase in HRV (p < .001). EEG theta (4-8 Hz) activity increased\nwhile playing flutes (p = .007) and alpha (8-12 Hz) increased while playing\nlower-pitched flutes (p = .009). Increase in alpha from baseline to the flute\nplaying conditions strongly correlated with experience playing Native American\nflutes (r = +.700). Wide-band beta (12-25 Hz) decreased from the silence\nconditions when listening to solo Native American flute music (p = .013). The\nfindings of increased HRV, increasing slow-wave rhythms, and decreased beta\nsupport the hypothesis that Native American flutes, particularly those with\nlower pitches, may have a role in music therapy contexts. We conclude that the\nNative American flute may merit a more prominent role in music therapy and that\na study of the effects of flute playing on clinical conditions, such as\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease (COPD), hypertension, anxiety, and major depressive disorder, is\nwarranted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 02:44:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 03:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-27"}

Here we extend the study to other regions including Central England,\nUS and Australia and to several other annual intervals that exhibit strong 27\nday variation in cosmic ray flux and sunspot area. Band pass filtering was used\nto obtain 27 day components of daily maximum temperature in each region and 27\nday components of cloud variation were determined, in Australia only, from\nsolar exposure records. When cosmic ray flux is the dominant influence phase\nlocked variations in surface temperature occur in each of the regions with,\nhowever, in phase or anti phase variation in different regions. Similar phase\nlocking of 27 day variation in surface temperature to sunspot area variation\noccurs when sunspot activity is the dominant influence with indications that\nchanges from in phase to anti phase variation are linked to flipping of sunspot\nactivity from one active longitude to another. The 27 day component of cloud in\nAustralia was phase locked to the 27 day component of temperature in Central\nEngland in two of the intervals studied, 1997 and 2005, indicating the global\nnature of the connection between solar disturbance and the lower atmosphere.

To abstract away from potentially\nemotionally laden opinions, we instead simulate the spread of a zombie outbreak\nin a society. The virus causing this outbreak is different from traditional\napproaches: it not only causes a binary outcome (healthy vs infected) but\nrather a continuous outcome. To counteract the outbreak, a discrete number of\ninfection-level specific treatments is available. This corresponds to acts of\nmild persuasion or the threats of legal action in the opinion spreading use\ncase. This paper offers a genetic and a cultural algorithm that find the\noptimal mixture of treatments during the run of the simulation. They are\nassessed in a number of different scenarios. It is shown, that albeit far from\nbeing perfect, the cultural algorithm delivers superior performance at lower\ncomputational expense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 15:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-27"}
