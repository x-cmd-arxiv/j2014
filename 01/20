To this end, this paper introduces the notion of second-order\nalgebraic theory and develops its basic theory. A crucial role in the\ndefinition is played by the second-order theory of equality $\\M$, representing\nthe most elementary operators and equations present in every second-order\nlanguage. The category $\\M$ can be described abstractly via the universal\nproperty of being the free cartesian category on an exponentiable object.\nThereby, in the tradition of categorical algebra, a second-order algebraic\ntheory consists of a cartesian category $\\Mlaw$ and a strict cartesian\nidentity-on-objects functor $\\M \\to \\Mlaw$ that preserves the universal\nexponentiable object of $\\Mlaw$. Lawvere's functorial semantics for algebraic\ntheories can then be generalised to the second-order setting. To verify the\ncorrectness of our theory, two categorical equivalences are established: at the\nsyntactic level, that of second-order equational presentations and second-order\nalgebraic theories; at the semantic level, that of second-order algebras and\nsecond-order functorial models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2014 16:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}

In this work, we consider bounds on the\nfractional repetition capacity, which is the maximum amount of data that can be\nstored using an FR code. Optimal FR codes which attain these bounds are\npresented. The constructions of these FR codes are based on combinatorial\ndesigns and on families of regular and biregular graphs. These constructions of\nFR codes for given parameters raise some interesting questions in graph theory.\nThese questions and some of their solutions are discussed in this paper.

Like SIC detection, the\nperformance of THP strongly depends on the ordering of the precoded symbols.\nThe optimal ordering algorithm, however, is impractical for multiuser MIMO\n(MU-MIMO) systems with multiple receive antennas due to the fact that the users\nare geographically distributed. In this paper, we propose a multi-branch THP\n(MB-THP) scheme and algorithms that employ multiple transmit processing and\nordering strategies along with a selection scheme to mitigate interference in\nMU-MIMO systems. Two types of multi-branch THP (MB-THP) structures are\nproposed.

Calculating\nthe quantum mean free path (l) in the effective metallic phase from a realistic\ntransport theory including disorder scattering effects, we solve the integral\nequation defined by the Ioffe-Regel criterion to obtain the nonuniversal\ncritical density n_c as a function of the applicable physical experimental\nparameters including disorder strength, in-plane magnetic field, spin and\nvalley degeneracy, background dielectric constant and carrier effective mass,\nand temperature. The key physics underlying the nonuniversal parameter\ndependence of the n_c is the temperature and density dependence of the Coulomb\ndisorder. Our calculated results for the crossover n_c appear to be in\nqualitative and semi-quantitative agreement with the available experimental\ndata in different 2D semiconductor systems lending credence to the possibility\nthat the apparent 2D MIT signals the onset of the strong localization crossover\nin disordered 2D systems. We provide some results for graphene where a\nlow-temperature 2D MIT becomes possible in the presence of intervalley\nscattering. We also provide an extensive comparison with the theoretical\nresults obtained on the basis of 2D MIT being considered as a percolation\ntransition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 00:24:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 19:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

The\nsuperconducting circuit behind the proposed simulator entails an array of\ntransmon qubits and microwave resonators. By applying microwave driving fields\nto the qubits, a small-polaron Bloch state with an arbitrary quasimomentum can\nbe prepared in this system within times several orders of magnitude shorter\nthan the typical qubit decoherence times.

Bayes' risk is the\nminimum expected classification cost that is achieved by the Bayes' test, the\noptimal decision rule. When no cost incurs for correct classification and unit\ncost is charged for misclassification, Bayes' test reduces to the maximum a\nposteriori decision rule, and Bayes risk simplifies to Bayes' error, the\nprobability of error. Since calculating this probability of error is often\nintractable, several techniques have been devised to bound it with closed-form\nformula, introducing thereby measures of similarity and divergence between\ndistributions like the Bhattacharyya coefficient and its associated\nBhattacharyya distance. The Bhattacharyya upper bound can further be tightened\nusing the Chernoff information that relies on the notion of best error\nexponent. In this paper, we first express Bayes' risk using the total variation\ndistance on scaled distributions. We then elucidate and extend the\nBhattacharyya and the Chernoff upper bound mechanisms using generalized\nweighted means. We provide as a byproduct novel notions of statistical\ndivergences and affinity coefficients. We illustrate our technique by deriving\nnew upper bounds for the univariate Cauchy and the multivariate\n$t$-distributions, and show experimentally that those bounds are not too\ndistant to the computationally intractable Bayes' error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 04:05:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

We start by looking at the background field\nquantisation of a general N=1 super-Yang-Mills theory, rederiving the\nwell-known 1 loop finiteness conditions. This is followed by a reexamination of\nthe effective potential of the Wess-Zumino model, focusing on a derivation of\nthe full auxiliary fields' potential. Next, the 2 loop Euler-Heisenberg\neffective action is constructed for N=1 supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics;\nits renormalisation properties and self-dual limit are studied.

This is the\nfirst of a series of papers presenting the results of the Giraffe Inner Bulge\nSurvey, carried out at the ESO-VLT with the multifibre spectrograph FLAMES.\nSpectra of ~5000 red clump giants in 24 bulge fields have been obtained at\nresolution R=6500, in the infrared Calcium triplet wavelength region at 8500\n{\\AA}. They are used to derive radial velocities and metallicities, based on\nnew calibration specifically devised for this project. Radial velocities for\nanother ~1200 bulge red clump giants, obtained from similar archive data, have\nbeen added to the sample. Higher resolution spectra have been obtained for 450\nadditional stars at latitude b=-3.5, with the aim of investigating chemical\nabundance patterns variations with longitude, across the inner bulge. In total\nwe present here radial velocities for 6392 RC stars. We derive a radial\nvelocity, and velocity dispersion map of the Milky Way bulge, useful to be\ncompared with similar maps of external bulges, and to infer the expected\nvelocities and dispersion at any line of sight. The K-type giants kinematics is\nconsistent with the cylindrical rotation pattern of M-giants from the BRAVA\nsurvey. Our sample enables to extend this result to latitude b=-2, closer to\nthe Galactic plane than probed by previous surveys. Finally, we find strong\nevidence for a velocity dispersion peak at (0,-1) and (0,-2), possibly\nindicative of a high density peak in the central 250 pc of the bulge\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 12:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Furthermore, it is probable that some of these magnetic\nfields are generated locally by a convective dynamo mechanism. In addition to\nthe well-known granular and supergranular convective scales, various\nobservations have indicated that there is an intermediate scale of convection,\nknown as mesogranulation, with vertical magnetic flux concentrations\naccumulating preferentially at mesogranular boundaries. Our aim is to\ninvestigate the small-scale dynamo properties of a convective flow that\nexhibits both granulation and mesogranulation, comparing our findings with\nsolar observations. Adopting an idealised model for a localised region of quiet\nSun, we use numerical simulations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics, in a 3D\nCartesian domain, to investigate the parametric dependence of this system\n(focusing particularly upon the effects of varying the aspect ratio and the\nReynolds number). In purely hydrodynamic convection, we find that\nmesogranulation is a robust feature of this system provided that the domain is\nwide enough to accommodate these large-scale motions. The mesogranular peak in\nthe kinetic energy spectrum is more pronounced in the higher Reynolds number\nsimulations. We investigate the dynamo properties of this system in both the\nkinematic and the nonlinear regimes and we find that the dynamo is always more\nefficient in larger domains, when mesogranulation is present. Furthermore, we\nuse a filtering technique in Fourier space to demonstrate that it is indeed the\nlarger scales of motion that are primarily responsible for driving the dynamo.\nIn the nonlinear regime, the magnetic field distribution compares very\nfavourably to observations, both in terms of the spatial distribution and the\nmeasured field strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 14:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Molecular emission\nlines play a crucial role in the cooling of the excited gas. With SPIRE on the\nHerschel Space Observatory we have observed the rich molecular spectrum towards\nthe central region of NGC 253. CO transitions from J=4-3 to 13-12 are observed\nand together with low-J line fluxes from ground based observations, these lines\ntrace the excitation of CO. By studying the CO excitation ladder and comparing\nthe intensities to models, we investigate whether the gas is excited by UV\nradiation, X-rays, cosmic rays, or turbulent heating. Comparing the $^{12}$CO\nand $^{13}$CO observations to large velocity gradient models and PDR models we\nfind three main ISM phases. We estimate the density, temperature,and masses of\nthese ISM phases. By adding $^{13}$CO, HCN, and HNC line intensities, we are\nable to constrain these degeneracies and determine the heating sources.

A given generalization allows describing of such non\nequilibrium processes as Levy flights in a classical differential form without\nuse of fractal PDE. Besides it takes into account mixing properties that are\nobligatory for a certain class of chaotic systems such as Kolmogorov K system.\nIt was shown that an abnormal transport is a consequence of the equilibrium\ndistortion and not stationary diffusion. The particular case of fixed\nboundaries was considered. According to the received solutions it was shown\nthat a system structure can resist a weak disturbance in the vicinity of the\ndiscrete regimes, defined by a system scale and its nonlinear properties. These\nregimes correspond to the exponential increase of quasi regular structure\nfluctuations. Only fast disruption of regime is possible for other states of\nthe system. It leads to an immediate transition to the chaos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 09:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-30"}
