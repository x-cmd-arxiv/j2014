Despite this superficial\nsimilarity, the control objectives in microgrids across these three layers are\nvaried and ambitious, and they must be achieved while allowing for robust\nplug-and-play operation and maximal flexibility, without hierarchical decision\nmaking and time-scale separations. In this work, we explore control strategies\nfor these three layers and illuminate some possibly-unexpected connections and\ndependencies among them. Building from a first-principle analysis of\ndecentralized primary droop control, we study centralized, decentralized, and\ndistributed architectures for secondary frequency regulation. We find that\naveraging-based distributed controllers using communication among the\ngeneration units offer the best combination of flexibility and performance. We\nfurther leverage these results to study constrained AC economic dispatch in a\ntertiary control layer. Surprisingly, we show that the minimizers of the\neconomic dispatch problem are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of\nsteady-states reachable by droop control. In other words, the adoption of droop\ncontrol is necessary and sufficient to achieve economic optimization. This\nequivalence results in simple guidelines to select the droop coefficients,\nwhich include the known criteria for power sharing.

Our simulations include the physics\nnecessary to model the signal during both the late emission regime and the\nearly absorption regime, namely X-ray and Lyman-band 3D radiative transfer in\naddition to the usual dynamics and ionizing UV transfer. The signal is analysed\nusing correlation functions perpendicular and parallel to the line of sight\n(LOS). We reproduce general findings from previous theoretical studies: the\noverall amplitude of the correlations and the fact that the light cone\nanisotropy is visible only on large scales (100 cMpc). However, the detailed\nbehaviour is different. At 3 different epochs, the amplitude of the\ncorrelations along and perpendicular to the LOS differ from each other,\nindicating anisotropy. These 3 epochs are associated with 3 events of the\nglobal reionization history: the overlap of ionized bubbles, the onset of mild\nheating by X-rays in regions around the sources, and the onset of efficient\nLyman-alpha coupling in regions around the sources. A 20x20 deg^2 survey area\nmay be necessary to mitigate sample variance when we use the directional\ncorrelation functions. On a 100 cMpc scale the light cone anisotropy dominates\nover the anisotropy generated by peculiar velocity gradients computed in the\nlinear regime. By modelling instrumental noise and limited resolution, we find\nthat the anisotropy should be easily detectable by the SKA, assuming perfect\nforeground removal, the limiting factor being a large enough survey size. In\nthe case of the LOFAR, it is likely that only first anisotropy episode will\nfall in the observing frequency range and will be detectable only if sample\nvariance is much reduced (i.e. a larger than 20x20 deg^2 survey, which is not\npresently planned).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 20:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-09"}

The\nmechanism powering such events is thought to be linked to tapping of the\nangular momentum (spin) of the black hole, the rate of accretion through the\ndisc or some combination of the two. We can attempt to discriminate between\nthese possibilities by comparing proxies for jet power with spin estimates. Due\nto the small number of sources reaching Eddington rates and have therefore been\nsuggested to act as 'standard candles', there has been much recent debate as to\nwhether a significant correlation exists between jet power and spin. We perform\ncontinuum fitting to the high-quality, disc-dominated XMM-Newton spectra of the\nextragalactic microquasar discovered in M31. Assuming prograde spin, we find\nthat, for sensible constraints the spin is always very low (a < 0.15 at\n3-sigma). When combined with a proxy for jet power derived from the maximum 5\nGHz radio luminosity during a bright flaring event, we find that the source\nsits well above the previously reported, rising correlation that would indicate\nthat spin tapping is the dominant mechanism for powering the jets. The notable\nexceptions require the inclination to be improbably small or the jet to be very\nfast. We investigate whether this could be a by-product of selecting\nprograde-only spin, finding that the data statistically favour a substantially\nretrograde spin for the same constraints (a < -0.17 at 3-sigma). Although\ntheoretically improbable, this remarkable finding could be confirmation that\nretrograde spin can power such jets via spin-tapping, as has been suggested for\ncertain radio quasars. In either case this work demonstrates the value of\nstudying local extragalactic microquasars as a means to better understand the\nphysics of jet launching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 21:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Furthermore, we carry out theoretical\ninvestigations into the least squares estimation that is widely used in the\nliterature. A simulation study is presented that supports our theorems.\nFinally, an application to a climate data set is provided to demonstrate the\napplicability of our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 21:23:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 18:46:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 18 Jan 2015 19:32:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 21:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-12"}

A fraction of their radiation can be reprocessed into\nthe thermal nebular emission, seen in the spectrum from the near-UV to longer\nwavelengths. In the case of symbiotic X-ray binaries (SyXBs) a strong\ncontribution from their cool giants is indicated in the optical/near-IR. In\nthis paper I introduce a method of multiwavelength modelling the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) of SSSs from the supersoft X-rays to the near-IR with\nthe aim to determine the physical parameters of their composite spectra. The\nmethod is demonstrated on two extragalactic SSSs, the SyXB RX J0059.1-7505 (LIN\n358) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), RX J0439.8-6809 in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) and two Galactic SSSs, the classical nova RX\nJ2030.5+5237 (V1974 Cyg) during its supersoft phase and the classical symbiotic\nstar RX J1601.6+6648 (AG Dra) during its quiescent phase. The multiwavelength\napproach overcomes the problem of the mutual dependence between the\ntemperature, luminosity and amount of absorption, which appears when only the\nX-ray data are fitted.Thus, the method provides an unambiguous solution. It was\nfound that selection of the model (a blackbody or an atmospheric model) is not\nof crucial importance in fitting the global X-ray/IR SED. The multiwavelength\nmodelling of the SED of SSSs is essential in determining their physical\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 22:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The advent of cirquent calculus arose from the need for a deductive\nsystem with a more explicit ability to reason about resources. Unlike the more\ntraditional proof-theoretic approaches that manipulate tree-like objects\n(formulas, sequents, etc.), cirquent calculus is based on circuit-style\nstructures called cirquents, in which different \"peer\" (sibling, cousin, etc.)\nsubstructures may share components. It is this resource sharing mechanism to\nwhich cirquent calculus owes its novelty (and its virtues). From its inception,\ncirquent calculus has been paired with an abstract resource semantics. This\nsemantics allows for reasoning about the interaction between a resource\nprovider and a resource user, where resources are understood in the their most\ngeneral and intuitive sense. Interpreting resources in a more restricted\ncomputational sense has made cirquent calculus instrumental in axiomatizing\nvarious fundamental fragments of Computability Logic, a formal theory of\n(interactive) computability. The so-called \"classical\" rules of cirquent\ncalculus, in the absence of the particularly troublesome contraction rule,\nproduce a sound and complete system CL5 for Computability Logic.

Multimoded bolometers provide a unique solution to achieve such\nsensitivity, for which hundreds of single-mode sensors would otherwise be\nrequired. The primary concern in employing such multimoded sensors for\npolarimetery is the control of the polarization systematics. In this paper, we\nexamine the angular- and polarization- dependent absorption pattern of a thin\nresistive grid or membrane, which models an absorber used for a multimoded\nbolometer. The result shows that a freestanding thin resistive absorber with a\nsurface resistivity of \\eta/2, where \\eta\\ is the impedance of free space,\nattains a beam pattern with equal E- and H-plane responses, leading to zero\ncross polarization. For a resistive-grid absorber, the condition is met when a\npair of grids is positioned orthogonal to each other and both have a\nresistivity of \\eta/2. When a reflective backshort termination is employed to\nimprove absorption efficiency, the cross-polar level can be suppressed below\n-30 dB if acceptance angle of the sensor is limited to <60degrees. The small\ncross-polar systematics have even-parity patterns and do not contaminate the\nmeasurements of odd-parity polarization patterns, for which many of recent\ninstruments for cosmic microwave background are designed. Underlying symmetry\nthat suppresses these cross-polar systematics is discussed in detail.

Moreover, recent\nsignatures of magnetization in gated SrTiO$_3$ have further galvanized interest\nin the emergent properties of this nominally nonmagnetic material. Here we\nobserve an optically induced and persistent magnetization in oxygen-deficient\nSrTiO$_{3-\\delta}$ using magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy and\nSQUID magnetometry. This zero-field magnetization appears below ~18K, persists\nfor hours below 10K, and is tunable via the polarization and wavelength of\nsub-bandgap (400-500nm) light. These effects occur only in oxygen-deficient\nsamples, revealing the detailed interplay between magnetism, lattice defects,\nand light in an archetypal oxide material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 00:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-11"}

We find that atmospheres with a low\nmean-molecular weight have strong day-night temperature variations at pressures\nabove the infrared photosphere that lead to equatorial superrotation. For these\natmospheres, the enhancement of atmospheric opacities with increasing\nmetallicity lead to shallower atmospheric heating, larger day-night temperature\nvariations and hence stronger superrotation. In comparison, atmospheres with a\nhigh mean-molecular weight have larger day-night and equator-to-pole\ntemperature variations than low mean-molecular weight atmospheres, but\ndifferences in opacity structure and energy budget lead to differences in jet\nstructure. The circulation of a water-dominated atmosphere is dominated by\nequatorial superrotation, while the circulation of a CO2-dominated atmosphere\nis instead dominated by high-latitude jets. By comparing emergent flux spectra\nand lightcurves for 50x solar and water-dominated compositions, we show that\nobservations in emission can break the degeneracy in determining the\natmospheric composition of GJ 1214b. The variation in opacity with wavelength\nfor the water-dominated atmosphere leads to large phase variations within water\nbands and small phase variations outside of water bands.

This notion, introduced by B{\\'u}jtas and Tuza, generalises\nboth classical hypergraph colourings and the more general Voloshin colourings\nof hypergraphs. In fact, for $r$-uniform hypergraphs, classical colourings\ncorrespond to $(2,r)$-colourings while an important instance of Voloshin\ncolourings of $r$-uniform hypergraphs gives $(2, r-1)$-colourings. One\nintriguing aspect of all these colourings, not present in classical colourings,\nis that $H$ can have gaps in its $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-spectrum, that is, for $k_1 <\nk_2 < k_3$, $H$ would be $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-colourable using $k_1$ and using\n$k_3$ colours, but not using $k_2$ colours.\n  In an earlier paper, the first two authors introduced, for $\\sigma$ a\npartition of $r$, a very versatile type of $r$-uniform hypergraph which they\ncalled $\\sigma$-hypergraphs. They showed that, by simple manipulation of the\nparameters of a $\\sigma$-hypergraph $H$, one can obtain families of hypergraphs\nwhich have $(2,r-1)$-colourings exhibiting various interesting chromatic\nproperties. They also showed that, if the smallest part of $\\sigma$ is at least\n2, then $H$ will never have a gap in its $(2,r-1)$-spectrum but, quite\nsurprisingly, they found examples where gaps re-appear when $\\alpha=\\beta=2$.\n  In this paper we extend many of the results of the first two authors to more\ngeneral $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-colourings, and we study the phenomenon of the\ndisappearanace and re-appearance of gaps and show that it is not just the\nbehaviour of a particular example but we place it within the context of a more\ngeneral study of constrained colourings of $\\sigma$-hypergraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 08:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-10"}

For such studies, it is crucial to\nevaluate the distance to group members in order to access their physical\nproperties. Membership of several stars is strongly debated and age estimates\nvary from one author to another with doubts about coevality. We revisit the\nkinematic properties of the TWA in light of new trigonometric parallaxes and\nproper motions to derive the dynamical age of the association and physical\nparameters of kinematic members. Using observations performed with the NTT/ESO\ntelescope we measured trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions for 13 stars\nin TWA. With the convergent point method we identify a co-moving group with 31\nTWA stars. We deduce kinematic distances for 7 members of the moving group that\nlack trigonometric parallaxes. A traceback strategy is applied to the stellar\nspace motions of a selection of 16 of the co-moving objects with accurate and\nreliable data yielding a dynamical age for the association of t = 7.5 +/- 0.7\nMyr. Using our new parallaxes and photometry available in the literature we\nderive stellar ages and masses from theoretical evolutionary models. With new\nparallax and proper motion measurements from this work and current astrometric\ncatalogs we provide an improved and accurate database for TWA stars to be used\nin kinematical analysis. We conclude that the dynamical age obtained via\ntraceback strategy is consistent with previous age estimates for the TWA, and\nis also compatible with the average ages derived in the present paper from\nevolutionary models for pre-main sequence stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 09:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In\nparticular, in each time slot, a single user is scheduled to receive\ninformation, while the remaining users opportunistically harvest the ambient\nradio frequency energy. We devise novel online scheduling schemes in which the\ntradeoff between the users' ergodic rates and their average amount of harvested\nenergy can be controlled. In particular, we modify the well-known maximum\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and maximum normalized-SNR (N-SNR) schedulers by\nscheduling the user whose SNR/N-SNR has a certain ascending order (selection\norder) rather than the maximum one. We refer to these new schemes as\norder-based SNR/N-SNR scheduling and show that the lower the selection order,\nthe higher the average amount of harvested energy in the system at the expense\nof a reduced ergodic sum rate. The order-based N-SNR scheduling scheme provides\nproportional fairness among the users in terms of both the ergodic achievable\nrate and the average harvested energy. Furthermore, we propose an order-based\nequal throughput (ET) fair scheduler, which schedules the user having the\nminimum moving average throughput out of the users whose N-SNR orders fall into\na given set of allowed orders. We show that this scheme provides the users with\nproportionally fair average harvested energies.

Often, views from all around the\nobject have to be acquired for a full 3D description of the object surface. We\npresent a sensor principle called \"Flying Triangulation\" which avoids an\nelaborate \"stop-and-go\" procedure. It combines a low-cost classical\nlight-section sensor with an algorithmic pipeline. A hand-guided sensor\ncaptures a continuous movie of 3D views while being moved around the object.\nThe views are automatically aligned and the acquired 3D model is displayed in\nreal time. In contrast to most existing sensors no bandwidth is wasted for\nspatial or temporal encoding of the projected lines. Nor is an expensive color\ncamera necessary for 3D acquisition. The achievable measurement uncertainty and\nlateral resolution of the generated 3D data is merely limited by physics. An\nalternating projection of vertical and horizontal lines guarantees the\nexistence of corresponding points in successive 3D views. This enables a\nprecise registration without surface interpolation. For registration, a variant\nof the iterative closest point algorithm - adapted to the specific nature of\nour 3D views - is introduced. Furthermore, data reduction and smoothing without\nlosing lateral resolution as well as the acquisition and mapping of a color\ntexture is presented. The precision and applicability of the sensor is\ndemonstrated by simulation and measurement results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 10:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-10"}

In this framework, initially proposed to explain\nGRBs with precursor activity, the prompt emission is produced by accretion of\nmatter onto a newly-born magnetar, and the observed power is related to the\naccretion rate. The emission is eventually halted if the centrifugal forces are\nable to pause accretion. We show that the X-ray and optical afterglow is well\nexplained as the forward shock emission with a jet break plus a contribution\nfrom the spin-down of the magnetar. Our modelling does not require any\ncontribution from the reverse shock, that may still influence the afterglow\nlight curve at radio and mm frequencies, or in the optical at early times. We\nderive the magnetic field ($B\\sim 10^{16}$ G) and the spin period ($P\\sim 20$\nms) of the magnetar and obtain an independent estimate of the minimum\nluminosity for accretion. This minimum luminosity results well below the prompt\nemission luminosity of GRB 130427A, providing a strong consistency check for\nthe scenario where the entire prompt emission is the result of continuous\naccretion onto the magnetar. This is in agreement with the relatively long spin\nperiod of the magnetar.

In particular, two very important\nissues that may limit the application of green networking techniques concern,\nrespectively, network survivability, i.e. the network capability to react to\ndevice failures, and robustness to traffic variations. We propose novel\nmodelling techniques to minimize the daily energy consumption of IP networks,\nwhile explicitly guaranteeing, in addition to typical QoS requirements, both\nnetwork survivability and robustness to traffic variations. The impact of such\nlimitations on final network consumption is exhaustively investigated. Daily\ntraffic variations are modelled by dividing a single day into multiple time\nintervals (multi-period problem), and network consumption is reduced by putting\nto sleep idle line cards and chassis. To preserve network resiliency we\nconsider two different protection schemes, i.e. dedicated and shared\nprotection, according to which a backup path is assigned to each demand and a\ncertain amount of spare capacity has to be available on each link. Robustness\nto traffic variations is provided by means of a specific modelling framework\nthat allows to tune the conservatism degree of the solutions and to take into\naccount load variations of different magnitude. Furthermore, we impose some\ninter-period constraints necessary to guarantee network stability and preserve\nthe device lifetime. Both exact and heuristic methods are proposed.\nExperimentations carried out with realistic networks operated with flow-based\nrouting protocols (i.e. MPLS) show that significant savings, up to 30%, can be\nachieved also when both survivability and robustness are fully guaranteed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 12:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-10"}

'Earthshine' is the dim light seen on the otherwise dark side of the\nMoon, particularly when it is close to new. 'Earthlight', or reflected sunlight\nfrom the Earth, is the source of Earthshine.

From these measurements we are also able to quantify the colour of\nEarthlight. Methods. We present images of the Moon taken with a small refractor\nin Hawaii, in B and V bands and taken under favourable conditions so that\nscattered light in both bands almost completely cancels, yielding a map of the\nsurface in B-V colour. Co-addition of 100 such images taken in rapid succession\nsubstantially improves the signal to noise ratio, and several sources of\nphotometric bias are eliminated by use of relative methods.

The\nearthlit dark side of the Moon is observed to be 0.150 +/- 0.005 mag bluer in\nB-V than the sunlit bright side, in good agreement with the only known previous\nmeasurement of this quantity from 1967.

Frailty models assume that conditional on a frailty term for\neach cluster, the hazard functions of individuals within that cluster are\nindependent. These unknown frailty terms with their imposed distribution are\nused to express the association between the different individuals in a cluster.\nCopula models on the other hand assume that the joint survival function of the\nindividuals within a cluster is given by a copula function, evaluated in the\nmarginal survival function of each individual.

The\npure symmetry components of the electronic response are derived from the\npolarization dependent spectra. The $E$ and $T_2$ responses agree by and large\nwith longitudinal and optical transport data. However, an anomaly is observed\nright above the magnetic ordering temperature $T_{\\rm C}=29\\,{\\rm K}$ that is\nassociated with the fluctuations that drive the transition into the\nhelimagnetic phase first order. The $T_1$ spectra, reflecting mostly chiral\nspin excitations, have a temperature dependence similar to that of the $E$ and\n$T_2$ symmetries. The response in the fully symmetric $A$ representation has a\nconsiderably weaker temperature dependence than that in the other symmetries.\nAll nine Raman active phonon lines can be resolved at low temperature. The\npositions and line widths of the strongest four lines in $E$ and $T_2$ symmetry\nare analyzed in the temperature range $4<T<310\\,{\\rm K}$. Above $50\\,{\\rm K}$,\nthe temperature dependence is found to be conventional and given by anharmonic\nphonon decay and the lattice expansion. Distinct anomalies are observed in the\nrange of the helimagnetic transition and in the ordered phase. Applying a\nmagnetic field of $4\\,{\\rm T}$, well above the critical field, removes all\nanomalies and restores a conventional behavior highlighting the relationship\nbetween the anomalies and magnetism. The anomaly directly above $T_{\\rm C}$ in\nthe fluctuation range goes along with an anomaly in the thermal expansion.\nWhile the lattice constant changes continuously and has only a kink at $T_{\\rm\nC}$, all optical phonons soften abruptly suggesting a direct microscopic\ncoupling between spin order and optical phonons rather than a reaction to\nmagnetostriction effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 13:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

The new\nformulation is compared with Ertel's version and with others based on virtual\nand equivalent potential temperatures. The new potential vorticity is subject\nto conservative properties ensured by the Second Law applied to the moist-air\nmaterial derivatives. It is shown that the upper tropospheric and stratospheric\n(dry) structures are nearly the same as those obtained with Ertel's component.\nMoreover, new structures are observed in the low troposphere, with negative\nvalues associated with moist frontal regions. The negative values are observed\nin the frontal regions where slantwise convection instabilities may take place,\nbut they are smaller than those observed with the equivalent potential\nvorticity. The main purpose of the article is to diagnose the behaviour of the\nnew potential vorticity from numerical output generated by the ARPEGE NWP\nmodel, with the help of isobaric charts and vertical cross-sections. Two\ninversion methods are suggested.

Here, we discuss these features and compare and contrast the RFOT\nwith other types of transitions with an emphasis on the structural glass\ntransition problem. An important feature of the complete RFOT theory is that it\nhas at least two distinct transition temperatures, one of which is a dynamical\n(avoided) transition signaling loss of effective ergodicity, and the other is\nan equilibrium ideal glass transition. Particular attention is paid to the\ncoherence, or correlation, length associated with these transitions in the\nRFOT. We also derive universal scaling relations for several experimentally\nmeasurable quantities that are valid near the ideal glass transition. In\nparticular, activated scaling ideas are used to obtain a scaling equation for\nthe non-linear structural glass susceptibility as the ideal glass transition is\napproached. Important finite corrections to the ideal glass transition\ntemperature are also discussed.

The mean relative deviation is determined to be within 2%, and\nthe pixel-by-pixel scatter is ~7%. The scatter increases towards the edges of\nthe maps. The uncertainty in the frequency scale is also studied, and the\nspread in the line centre velocity across the maps is found to be ~15 km/s.\nOther causes of uncertainty are also discussed including the effect of pointing\nand the additive uncertainty in the continuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 15:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Traditionally tasks acquire and release locks to\nsynchronize operations on shared memory. Unfortunately, lock management can add\nsignificant processing overhead especially for multicore deployments where\ntasks on different cores convoy in queues waiting to acquire a lock.\nImplementing more than one lock introduces the risk of deadlock and using\nspinlocks constrains which cores a task can run on. The better alternative is\nto eliminate locks and validate that real-time properties are met, which is not\ndirectly considered in many embedded applications. Removing the locks is\nnon-trivial and packaging lock-free algorithms for developers reduces the\npossibility of concurrency defects. This paper details how a multicore\ncommunication API implementation is enhanced to support lock-free messaging and\nthe impact this has on data exchange latency between tasks. Throughput and\nlatency are compared on Windows and Linux between lock-based and lock-free\nimplementations for data exchange of messages, packets, and scalars. A model of\nthe lock-free exchange predicts performance at the system architecture level\nand provides a stop criterion for the refactoring. The results show that\nmigration from single to multicore hardware architectures degrades lock-based\nperformance, and increases lock-free performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 00:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-24"}
