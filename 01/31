We present the Passivity-based Selective Belief Filtering (PSBF)\nmethod, which maintains a factored belief representation and exploits passivity\nto perform selective updates over the belief factors. PSBF produces exact\nbelief states under certain assumptions and approximate belief states\notherwise, where the approximation error is bounded by the degree of\nuncertainty in the process.

We aim to understand the nature of the Li enrichment by performing a\nspectroscopic analysis of the star, in particular of its beryllium (Be)\nabundance, and by investigating its binary nature. We observe the near UV\nregion where the Beii resonance doublet and the NH bands are located. We could\nnot detect the Beii lines and derive an upper limit of log (Be/H)< -12.2, that\nis consistent with the Be observed in other stars of the cluster. We could\ndetect a weak G-band, which implies a mild carbon enhancement\n[C/Fe]$+0.4\\pm0.2$. We could not detect the UV NH band, and we derive an upper\nlimit [N/Fe]$< 0.0$. For oxygen we could notdetect any of the near UV OH lines,\nwhich implies that oxygen cannot be strongly enhanced in this star. This is\nconsistent with the detection of the Oi triplet at 777nm, which is consistent\nwith [O/Fe]~0.5. Combining the UVES and Mike data, we could not detect any\nvariation in the radial velocity greater than 0.95 kms$^{-1}$ over 8 years. The\nchemical composition of the star strongly resembles that of `first generation'\nNGC6397 stars, with the huge Li as the only deviating abundance. Not detecting\nBe rules out two possible explanations of the Li overabundance: capture of a\nsubstellar body and spallation caused by a nearby type II SNe.

A small quantum dot (QD), having a single relevant\nelectronic level, is coupled to source and drain electrodes. A larger QD, whose\nmultilevel nature is considered, is tunnel-coupled to the small QD. A Fermi\nliquid analysis shows that the low temperature conductance of the device is\ndetermined by the total electronic occupation of the double QD. When the small\ndot is in the Kondo regime, an even number of electrons in the large dot leads\nto a conductance that reaches the unitary limit, while for an odd number of\nelectrons a two stage Kondo effect is observed and the conductance is strongly\nsuppressed. The Kondo temperature of the second stage Kondo effect is strongly\naffected by the multilevel structure of the large QD. For increasing level\nspacing, a crossover from a large Kondo temperature regime to a small Kondo\ntemperature regime is obtained when the level spacing becomes of the order of\nthe large Kondo temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 19:34:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 14:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-12"}

This work extends in a natural way the well-studied\nmodel by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos (2003), where a designer selects a\n(small) seed set of nodes in a social network to influence directly, this\ninfluence cascades when other nodes reach certain thresholds of neighbor\ninfluence, and the goal is to maximize the final number of influenced nodes.\nDespite extensive study from both practical and theoretical viewpoints, this\nmodel limits the designer to a binary choice for each node, with no way to\napply intermediate levels of influence. This model captures some settings\nprecisely, e.g. exposure to an idea or pathogen, but it fails to capture very\nrelevant concerns in others, for example, a manufacturer promoting a new\nproduct by distributing five \"20% off\" coupons instead of giving away one free\nproduct.\n  While fractional versions of problems tend to be easier to solve than\nintegral versions, for influence maximization, we show that the two versions\nhave essentially the same computational complexity. On the other hand, the two\nversions can have vastly different solutions: the added flexibility of\nfractional allocation can lead to significantly improved influence. Our main\ntheoretical contribution is to show how to adapt the major positive results\nfrom the integral case to the fractional case. Specifically, Mossel and Roch\n(2006) used the submodularity of influence to obtain their integral results; we\nintroduce a new notion of continuous submodularity, and use this to obtain\nmatching fractional results. We conclude that we can achieve the same greedy\n$(1-1/e-\\epsilon)$-approximation for the fractional case as the integral case.\nIn practice, we find that the fractional model performs substantially better\nthan the integral model, according to simulations on real-world social network\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 20:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-31"}

Within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae\n(SN) of all types, out to z~2.5.

We argue that this is necessary in\norder to apply standard statistical mechanics to the study of the interaction\nbetween a thermalized system and a reference. We then derive a condition for\nrelative thermalization of quantum systems interacting with an arbitrary\nenvironment. This condition has two components: the first is state-independent,\nreflecting the structure of invariant subspaces, like energy shells, and the\nrelative sizes of system and environment; the second depends on the initial\ncorrelations between reference, system and environment, measured in terms of\nconditional entropies. Intuitively, a small system interacting with a large\nenvironment is likely to thermalize relative to a reference, but only if,\ninitially, the reference was not highly correlated with the system and\nenvironment.

Here we perform a systematic study of turbulent mixing in magnetized\nmedia, using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations that include a\nscalar concentration field. We focus on how mixing depends on the magnetic\nPrandtl number, Pm, from 1 to 4 and the Mach number, M}, from 0.3 to 2.4. For\nall subsonic flows, we find that the velocity power spectrum has a k^-5/3 slope\nin the early, kinematic phase, but steepens due to magnetic back reactions as\nthe field saturates. The scalar power spectrum, on the other hand, flattens\ncompared to k^-5/3 at late times, consistent with the Obukohov-Corrsin picture\nof mixing as a cascade process. At higher Mach numbers, the velocity power\nspectrum also steepens due to the presence of shocks, and the scalar power\nspectrum again flattens accordingly. Scalar structures are more intermittent\nthan velocity structures in subsonic turbulence while for supersonic\nturbulence, velocity structures appear more intermittent than the scalars only\nin the kinematic phase. Independent of the Mach number of the flow, scalar\nstructures are arranged in sheets in both the kinematic and saturated phases of\nthe magnetic field evolution. For subsonic turbulence, scalar dissipation is\nhindered in the strong magnetic field regions, probably due to Lorentz forces\nsuppressing the buildup of scalar gradients, while for supersonic turbulence,\nscalar dissipation increases monotonically with increasing magnetic field\nstrength. At all Mach numbers, mixing is significantly slowed by the presence\nof dynamically-important small-scale magnetic fields, implying that mixing in\nthe interstellar medium and in galaxy clusters is less efficient than modeled\nin hydrodynamic simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 21:07:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 05:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Particle aggregation is driven by a temperature-tunable attractive\npotential which controls the growth of clusters under isothermal conditions. A\nseries of frequency resolved time sweeps is used to systematically reconstruct\nthe frequency dependent dynamic moduli as a function of time and temperature or\nattraction strength. The data display typical hallmarks of gelation with an\nabrupt transition from a fluid state into a dynamically arrested gel state\nafter a characteristic gelation time $t_g$ that varies exponentially with\ntemperature and serves to collapse the evolution of the system onto a universal\ncurve. We observe the viscoelastic properties of the critical gel where we find\nthat $G'(\\omega)\\approxeq G''(\\omega)\\sim \\omega^{n_c}$ where $n_c=0.5$ in a\nnarrow time window across all attraction strengths. We measure a dynamic\ncritical exponent of $\\kappa=0.25$ which is similar to that observed in\ncrosslinked polymer gels. The approach to the critical gel is therefore\ngoverned by $\\eta_0\\sim-\\epsilon^{-s}$ and $G_e\\sim\\epsilon^z$ with $s=z=2$\nwhere $\\epsilon=p/p_c-1$ is the distance to the gel point. Remarkably, the\nrelaxation moduli of the near-critical gels are identical across the\ntemperatures considered, with $G(t)\\approx0.33t^{-0.5}$. This suggests an\nunderlying strong similarity in gel structure in the regime of attraction\nstrengths considered, despite the differences in aggregation kinetics. We\ncontrast these findings with the behavior of a colloidal glass undergoing\ndynamical arrest where no critical state is observed and where the arrest time\nof the system displays a marked frequency dependence. These findings highlight\nthe underlying structural differences between colloidal gels and glasses which\nare manifest in their dynamic properties in the vicinity of the liquid-to-solid\ntransition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 22:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-03"}

Stellar radiation zones with baroclinic\nstratification can be unstable. Instabilities in radiation zones are of crucial\nimportance for angular momentum transport, mixing of chemical species and,\npossibly, for magnetic field generation. This paper performs linear analysis of\nbaroclinic instability in differentially rotating stars. Linear stability\nequations are formulated for differential rotation of arbitrary shape and then\nsolved numerically for rotation non-uniform in radius. As the differential\nrotation increases, r- and g-modes of initially stable global oscillations\ntransform smoothly into growing modes of baroclinic instability. The\ninstability can therefore be interpreted as stability loss to r- and g-modes\nexcitation. Regions of stellar parameters where r- or g-modes are\npreferentially excited are defined. Baroclinic instability onsets at a very\nsmall differential rotation of below 1%. The characteristic time of instability\ngrowth is about one thousand rotation periods. Growing disturbances possess\nkinetic helicity. Magnetic field generation by the turbulence resulting from\nbaroclinic instability in differentially rotating radiation zones is,\ntherefore, possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 05:49:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2014 05:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Based on the\nseries of filtergrams, the trajectories of corks are computed, using a\ntechnique similar to but more reliable than local correlation tracking (LCT),\nand compared with the magnetic maps. At this stage of the investigation, only\nthe vertical magnetic field and the horizontal flows are used for a qualitative\nanalysis. According to our preliminary findings, the velocity pattern in the\ngrowing active region has nothing to do with a spreading flow on the scale of\nthe entire bipolar region, which could be expected if a tube of strong magnetic\nfield emerged. No violent spreading flows on the scale of the entire growing\nmagnetic region can be identified. Instead, normal mesogranular and\nsupergranular flows are preserved. The observed scenario of evolution seems to\nagree with Bumba's inference that the development of an active region does not\nentail the destruction of the existing convective-velocity field. The\nconvective mechanism appears to be better compatible with observations than the\nrising-tube mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 07:46:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 19:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-15"}

Events are\nassociated with the entering of a new cycle. The feedback is modeled by an\ninstantaneous increase (positive feedback) or decrease (negative feedback) of\nthe oscillators frequency, whenever an event occurs followed by an exponential\ndecay on a slow timescale. In contrast to previous works, we also consider\npositive feedback that leads to various novel effects. For instance, besides\nthe known excitable and oscillatory regime, that are separated by a saddle-node\non invariant circle bifurcation, positive feedback can lead to bistable\ndynamics and a change of the system's excitability. The feedback has also a\nstrong effect on noise-induced phenomena like coherence resonance or\nanti-coherence resonance. Both positive and negative feedback can lead to more\nregular output for particular noise strengths. Finally, we investigate serial\ncorrelation in the sequence of interevent intervals that occur due to the\nadditional slow dynamics. We derive approximations for the serial correlation\ncoefficient and show that positive feedback results in extended positive\ninterval correlations whereas negative feedback yields short-ranging negative\ncorrelations. Investigating the interplay of feedback and the nonlinear phase\ndynamics close to the bifurcation, we find that correlations are most\npronounced for an optimal feedback strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 10:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

If the apparent horizon is taken as the boundary of\nthe universe, we have shown that the rate of change of the total entropy of the\nuniverse is proportional to $(1+q)^2,$ which in fact shows that the GSL is\nvalid at the apparent horizon irrespective of the sign of $q,$ the deceleration\nparameter. Hence for any form of dark energy the apparent horizon can be\nconsidered as a perfect thermodynamic boundary of the universe. We made a\nconfirmation of this conclusion by using the holographic dark energy. When\nevent horizon is taken as the boundary, we found that the GSL is only partially\nsatisfied.

Whereas some discrete models allow pedestrians (or\ncars, when applied to traffic modelling) to move more than a single cell per\ntime step, the present work proposes a maximum speed of one cell per step, but\nwe model lower speeds by having pedestrians yielding their movement in some\nturns. Different classes of pedestrians are associated to different desired\nwalking speeds and we define a stochastic mechanism ensuring that they maintain\nan average speed close to this threshold. In the paper we formally describe the\nmodel and we show the results of its application in benchmark scenarios.\nFinally, we also show how this approach can also support the definition of\nslopes and stairs as elements reducing the walking speed of pedestrians\nclimbing them in a simulated scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 11:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-03"}

In this\nstudy, an attempt is made to understand how the scales of convective motions\nare affected by the particularities of the static temperature stratification of\na fluid layer. To this end, simple models are considered. The equations of\ntwo-dimensional thermal convection are solved numerically for a plane\nhorizontal fluid layer heated from below, in an extended Boussinesq\napproximation that admits thermal-diffusivity variations. These variations\nspecify the stratification of the layer. The static temperature gradient in a\nthin sublayer near the upper surface of the layer is assumed to be many times\nlarger than in the remainder of the layer. In some cases, distributed heat\nsinks are assumed to produce a stably stratified region overlying the\nconvective layer.

This situation occurs in single-dish HI\nobservations of the local universe, but also frequently in high-redshift\nobservations. M_dyn-measurements in high-redshift galaxies are commonly\nobtained through observations of the CO line, the most abundant tracer of the\nmolecular medium. Even though the CO linewidth can in most cases be determined\nwith reasonable accuracy, a measurement of the size of the emitting region is\ntypically challenging given current facilities. We show how the integrated\nspectra (`global profiles') of a variety of galaxy models depend on the spatial\ndistribution of the tracer gas as well as its velocity dispersion. We\ndemonstrate that the choice of tracer emission line significantly affects the\nshape of the global profiles. In particular, in the case of high (~50 kms-1)\nvelocity dispersions, compact tracers (such as CO) result in Gaussian-like\n(non-double-horned) profiles, as is indeed frequently seen in high-redshift\nobservations. We determine at which radii the rotation curve reaches the\nrotation velocity corresponding to the velocity width, and find that for each\ntracer this happens at a well-defined radius: HI velocity widths typically\noriginate at ~5 optical scale lengths, while CO velocity widths trace the\nrotation velocity at ~2 scale lengths. We additionally explore other\ndistributions to take into account that CO distributions at high redshift\nlikely differ from those at low redshift. Our models, while not trying to\nreproduce individual galaxies, define characteristic radii that can be used in\nconjunction with the measured velocity widths in order to define dynamical\nmasses consistent with the assumed gas distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 13:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We propose an empirical model to fit the radial\nprofile of the HI surface density, an exponential function with a depression\nnear the center. The radial HI surface density profiles are very homogeneous in\nthe outer regions of the galaxy; the exponentially declining part of the\nprofile has a scale-length of $\\sim 0.18$ R1, where R1 is the radius where the\ncolumn density of the HI is 1 M$_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$. This holds for all\ngalaxies, independent of their stellar or HI mass. The homogenous outer\nprofiles, combined with the limited range in HI surface density in the\nnon-exponential inner disk, results in the well-known tight relation between HI\nsize and HI mass. By comparing the radial profiles of the HI-rich galaxies with\nthose of the control systems, we deduce that in about half the galaxies, most\nof the excess gas lies outside the stellar disk, in the exponentially declining\nouter regions of the HI disk. In the other half, the excess is more centrally\npeaked. We compare our results with existing smoothed-particle hydrodynamical\nsimulations and semi-analytic models of disk galaxy formation in a $\\Lambda$\nCold Dark Matter universe. Both the hydro simulations and the semi-analytic\nmodels reproduce the HI surface density profiles and the HI size-mass relation\nwithout further tuning of the simulation and model inputs. In the semi-analytic\nmodels, the universal shape of the outer HI radial profiles is a consequence of\nthe {\\em assumption} that infalling gas is always distributed exponentially.\nThe conversion of atomic gas to molecular form explains the limited range of HI\nsurface densities in the inner disk.

(ii) Each TCP packet is randomly dropped\nwith probability p; independently of previous drops or any other\nevent/parameter. (iii) The - never changing - receiver window limits the amount\nof outstanding data. (iv) The receiver acknowledges every packet.

The approach treats the curve defined by the height of the\noverdensity fluctuation field when changing the smoothing scale as a random\nwalk. The steps of the walks are often assumed to be uncorrelated, so that the\nwalk heights are a Markov process, even though this assumption is known to be\ninaccurate for physically relevant filters. We develop a model in which the\nwalk steps, rather than heights, are a Markov process, and correlations between\nsteps arise because of nearest neighbour interactions.

The MCO-3D plans used\nthe same number of beams, beam geometry and machine parameters of the\ncorresponding 3D plans, but were limited to an energy of 6 MV. The MCO-3D plans\nwere optimized using a fluence-based MCO IMRT algorithm and then, after MCO\nnavigation, segmented with a low number of segments. The 3D and MCO-3D plans\nwere compared by evaluating mean doses to individual organs at risk (OARs),\nmean doses to combined OARs, homogeneity indexes (HI), monitor units (MUs),\nphysician preference, and qualitative assessments of planning time and plan\ncustomizability.\n  Results: The MCO-3D plans significantly reduced the OAR mean doses and\nmonitor units while maintaining good coverage and homogeneity of target\nvolumes.

After a short\nreview of the formalism, we consider its use in the quantification of both\ngeneral non-local and beyond-quantum correlations. We argue that the unified\nframework for correlations provides a simple approach to such a quantification,\nin particular when the quantification is meant to be operational and meaningful\nin a resource-theory scenario, i.e., when considering the processing of\nresources by means of non-resources. We relate different notions of robustness\nof correlations, both at the level of (pseudo-)states and abstract probability\ndistributions, with particular focus on the beyond-quantum robustness of\ncorrelations and pseudo-states. We revisit known results and argue that, within\nthe unified framework, the relation between the two levels---that of operators\nand that of probability distributions---is very strict. We point out how the\nconsideration of robustness at the two levels leads to a natural framework for\nthe quantification of entanglement in a device-independent way. Finally, we\nshow that the beyond-quantum robustness of the non-positive operators needed to\nachieve beyond-quantum correlations coincides with their negativity and their\ndistance from the set of quantum states.

Freire et al. (2009, MNRAS,\n396, 1764) have put forward a technique using the modulation of B by A to\ndetermine the sense of rotation of pulsar A relative to its orbital motion,\namong other quantities. In this paper, we present another technique with the\nsame purpose. While the Freire et al. approach analyzes pulse arrival times,\nours instead uses periods or frequencies (their inverses), which can be\nexperimentally determined via power spectral analysis similar to that used in\npulsar searches. Our technique is based on the apparent change in spin period\nof a body when it is measured from an orbiting platform (the other pulsar), and\nis shown to be entirely analogous to the difference between the sidereal and\nsolar spin period of the Earth (i.e., the sidereal and solar day). Two benefits\nof this approach are its conceptual and computational simplicity. The direct\ndetection of spin with this technique will observationally validate the\nrotating lighthouse model of pulsar emission, while the detection of the\nrelative directions of spin and orbital angular momenta has important\nevolutionary implications. Our technique can be used on other binary systems\nexhibiting mutually induced phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 15:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-01"}

We emphasize the role that\nthe geometry of the extended manifold plays. Firstly we consider basic\nexamples. We give a projective line of diff($M$)-equivariant pencil liftings\nfor first order operators, and the canonical second order self-adjoint lifting.\nSecondly we study pencil liftings equivariant with respect to volume preserving\ntransformations. This helps to understand the role of self-adjointness for the\ncanonical pencils. Then we introduce the Duval-Lecomte-Ovsienko (DLO)-pencil\nlifting which is derived from the full symbol calculus of projective\nquantisation. We use the DLO-pencil lifting to describe all regular\nproj-equivariant pencil liftings. In particular the comparison of these pencils\nwith the canonical pencil for second order operators leads to objects related\nto the Schwarzian. Within this paper the question of whether the pencil lifting\nfactors through a full symbol map naturally arises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 14:59:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 07:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-16"}
