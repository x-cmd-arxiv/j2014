This function is given by the sum of a conformal term and of a\ncontribution due to quark confinement, depending on IR hard-wall parameter\n$z_0$ and on the mean square distances, related to a parameter $Q^\\prime$,\namong quarks and gluons in the target. The holographic structure function per\nnucleon in a nucleus $A$ is evaluated showing that a rescaling of the typical\nnucleon size, $z_0$ and $Q^\\prime$, due to nuclear binding, can be reabsorbed\nin a $Q^2$-rescaling scheme. The difference between neutron and proton\nstructure functions and the effects of the longitudinal structure functions can\nalso be taken into account.

In particular,\nwe define a simple model, based on the majority rule voting, in order to\nconsider the role of conformity. Conformity is a central issue in social\npsychology as it represents one of people's behaviors that emerges as a result\nof their interactions. The proposed model represents agents, arranged in a\nnetwork and provided with an individual behavior, that change opinion in\nfunction of those of their neighbors. In particular, agents can behave as\nconformists or as nonconformists. In the former case, agents change opinion in\naccordance with the majority of their social circle (i.e., their neighbors); in\nthe latter case, they do the opposite, i.e., they take the minority opinion.\nMoreover, we investigate the nonconformity both on a global and on a local\nperspective, i.e., in relation to the whole population and to the social circle\nof each nonconformist agent, respectively. We perform a computational study of\nthe proposed model, with the aim to observe if and how the conformity affects\nthe related outcomes. Moreover, we want to investigate whether it is possible\nto achieve some kind of equilibrium, or of order, during the evolution of the\nsystem. Results highlight that the amount of nonconformist agents in the\npopulation plays a central role in these dynamics. In particular, conformist\nagents play the role of stabilizers in fully-connected networks, whereas the\nopposite happens in complex networks. Furthermore, by analyzing complex\ntopologies of the agent network, we found that in the presence of radical\nnonconformist agents the topology of the system has a prominent role; otherwise\nit does not matter since we observed that a conformist behavior is almost\nalways more convenient. Finally, we analyze the results of the model by\nconsidering that agents can change also their behavior over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2014 19:13:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 07:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-18"}

Different\nfrom other partitioning concepts for the empirical interpolation method we\nperform an adaptive decomposition of the spatial domain.

We propose a novel\nsolution that addresses this problem without assuming detailed packet-level\nknowledge, which is unavailable at resource allocation time. Instead, we\ntranslate the transmission delay deadlines of each sender's video packets into\na monotonically-decreasing weight distribution within the considered time\nhorizon. Higher weights are assigned to the slots that have higher probability\nfor deadline-abiding delivery. Given the sets of weights of the senders' video\nstreams, we propose the low-complexity Delay-Aware Resource Allocation (DARA)\napproach to compute the optimal slot allocation policy that maximizes the\ndeadline-abiding delivery of all senders. A unique characteristic of the DARA\napproach is that it yields a non-stationary slot allocation policy that depends\non the allocation of previous slots. We prove that the DARA approach is optimal\nfor weight distributions that are exponentially decreasing in time.

Relying\non subjective, visual methods, scholars have grappled with their classification\nand regional attribution for over a century. This study combines visual\napproaches with machine-learning techniques to offer data-driven perspectives\non the classification and attribution of this early Iron Age corpus. The study\nsample consisted of 162 sculptures of female figures. We have developed an\nalgorithm that clusters the ivories based on a combination of descriptive and\nanthropometric data. The resulting categories, which are based on purely\nstatistical criteria, show good agreement with conventional art historical\nclassifications, while revealing new perspectives, especially with regard to\nthe contested Syrian/South Syrian/Intermediate tradition. Specifically, we have\nidentified that objects of the Syrian/South Syrian/Intermediate tradition may\nbe more closely related to Phoenician objects than to North Syrian objects; we\noffer a reconsideration of a subset of Phoenician objects, and we confirm\nSyrian/South Syrian/Intermediate stylistic subgroups that might distinguish\nnetworks of acquisition among the sites of Nimrud, Khorsabad, Arslan Tash and\nthe Levant. We have also identified which features are most significant in our\ncluster assignments and might thereby be most diagnostic of regional carving\ntraditions. In short, our study both corroborates traditional visual\nclassification methods and demonstrates how machine-learning techniques may be\nemployed to reveal complementary information not accessible through the\nexclusively visual analysis of an archaeological corpus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2014 08:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-07"}

To sparsely represent\nsignals residing on weighted graphs, an additional design challenge is to\nincorporate the intrinsic geometric structure of the irregular data domain into\nthe atoms of the dictionary. In this work, we propose a parametric dictionary\nlearning algorithm to design data-adapted, structured dictionaries that\nsparsely represent graph signals. In particular, we model graph signals as\ncombinations of overlapping local patterns. We impose the constraint that each\ndictionary is a concatenation of subdictionaries, with each subdictionary being\na polynomial of the graph Laplacian matrix, representing a single pattern\ntranslated to different areas of the graph. The learning algorithm adapts the\npatterns to a training set of graph signals. Experimental results on both\nsynthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the dictionaries learned by the\nproposed algorithm are competitive with and often better than unstructured\ndictionaries learned by state-of-the-art numerical learning algorithms in terms\nof sparse approximation of graph signals. In contrast to the unstructured\ndictionaries, however, the dictionaries learned by the proposed algorithm\nfeature localized atoms and can be implemented in a computationally efficient\nmanner in signal processing tasks such as compression, denoising, and\nclassification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2014 12:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

For DR\nand CR induced reactions, we adopt two well behaved rate formulas.

The\nability to induce strongly-correlated electron-hole states paves the way for\nthe realization of coherent circuits with minimal dissipation and nanodevices\nincluding analog-to-digital converters and topologically protected quantum\nbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2014 15:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-09"}

A Wiener-Hopf argument allows one to prove that this system (in\nwhich the kernel matrix is the unknown) possesses a unique causal solution and\nconsequently that the second-order properties fully characterize a Hawkes\nprocess. The numerical inversion of this system of integral equations allows us\nto propose a fast and efficient method, which main principles were initially\nsketched in [Bacry and Muzy, 2013], to perform a non-parametric estimation of\nthe Hawkes kernel matrix. In this paper, we perform a systematic study of this\nnon-parametric estimation procedure in the general framework of marked Hawkes\nprocesses. We describe precisely this procedure step by step. We discuss the\nestimation error and explain how the values for the main parameters should be\nchosen. Various numerical examples are given in order to illustrate the broad\npossibilities of this estimation procedure ranging from 1-dimensional\n(power-law or non positive kernels) up to 3-dimensional (circular dependence)\nprocesses. A comparison to other non-parametric estimation procedures is made.\nApplications to high frequency trading events in financial markets and to\nearthquakes occurrence dynamics are finally considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2014 15:28:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 08:33:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-16"}

In this paper, we present a comparative study on the ergodic\ncapacity of a downlink single-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system\nwhere BS antennas are either co-located at the center or grouped into uniformly\ndistributed antenna clusters in a circular cell. By assuming that the number of\nBS antennas and the number of user antennas go to infinity with a fixed ratio\n$L\\gg 1$, the asymptotic analysis reveals that the average per-antenna\ncapacities in both cases logarithmically increase with $L$, but in the orders\nof $\\log_2 L$ and $\\tfrac{\\alpha}{2}\\log_2 L$, for the co-located and\ndistributed BS antenna layouts, respectively, where $\\alpha>2$ denotes the\npath-loss factor. The analysis is further extended to the multi-user case where\na 1-tier (7-cell) MIMO cellular network with $K\\gg 1$ uniformly distributed\nusers in each cell is considered. By assuming that the number of BS antennas\nand the number of user antennas go to infinity with a fixed ratio $L\\gg K$, an\nasymptotic analysis is presented on the downlink rate performance with block\ndiagonalization (BD) adopted at each BS. It is shown that the average\nper-antenna rates with the co-located and distributed BS antenna layouts scale\nin the orders of $\\log_2 \\tfrac{L}{K}$ and $\\log_2\n\\frac{(L-K+1)^{\\alpha/2}}{K}$, respectively. The rate performance of MIMO\ncellular networks with small cells is also discussed, which highlights the\nimportance of employing a large number of distributed BS antennas for the\nnext-generation cellular networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2014 14:02:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 14:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

It is observed that the branching ratio with\npolarized $\\phi$ are quite sensitive to the $Z^{\\prime}$ contributions which\nare coming through the modification of Wilson coefficients $C^{eff}_{9}$ and\n$C_{10}$. Moreover, the off-diagonal elements of the chiral $Z^{\\prime}$\ncouplings contain new weak phase $\\phi_{sb}$ that provide a new source of $CP$\nviolation.

Our results indicate that these $CP$ violation asymmetries are\nremarkably significant and can attribute the any new physics coming through the\n$Z^{\\prime}$ boson.
