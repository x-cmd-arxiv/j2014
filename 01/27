To remedy this, we\ndevelop a large-deviation theory of scalar dispersion that provides an\napproximation to the scalar concentration valid at much larger distances away\nfrom the centre of mass, specifically distances that are $O(t)$ rather than\n$O(t^{1/2})$, where $t \\gg 1$ is the time from the scalar release.

We consider two classes of flows in some\ndetail: shear flows and cellular flows. In both cases, large deviation\ngeneralises classical results on effective diffusivity and captures new\nphenomena relevant to the tails of the scalar distribution.

Aims: We would like to\nexploit high-angular (~ 0.8\") resolution and high-sensitivity images to\ninvestigate the origin of protostellar jets using typical molecular tracers of\nshocked regions, such as SiO and SO. Methods: We mapped the inner 22\" of the\nNGC1333-IRAS2A protostar in SiO(5-4), SO(65-54), and the continuum emission at\n1.4 mm using the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer in the framework of the\nCALYPSO IRAM large program.

Silicon monoxide emission is a powerful tracer of\nhigh-excitation (Tkin > 100 K; n(H2) > 10^5 cm-3) jets close to the launching\nregion. At the highest velocities, SO appears to mimic SiO tracing the jets,\nwhereas at velocities close to the systemic one, SO is dominated by extended\nemission, tracing the cavity opened by the jet.

The dynamical time of the\nSiO clumps is < 30-90 yr, indicating that one-sided ejections from protostars\ncan take place on these timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2014 17:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

Due to\nthe well-known ill conditioning problem, no precisely resolved DEM can be\ninverted directly from the spectrum, so often only a gross parametrization of\nthe DEM is used to approximate the data, in hopes that the parametrization can\nprovide useful model-independent constraints on the heating process. However,\nill conditioning also introduces ambiguity into the various different\nparametrizations that could approximate the data, which may spoil the perceived\nadvantages of model independence. Thus, this paper instead suggests a single\nparametrization for both the heating mechanism and the X-ray sources, based on\na model of impulsive heating followed by complete cooling. This approach is\nsimilar to a ``cooling flow'' approach, but allows injection at multiple\ninitial temperatures, and applies even when the steady state is distribution of\ndifferent shock strengths, as for a standing shock with a range of obliquities,\nor for embedded stochastic shocks that are only steady in a statistical sense.\nThis produces an alternative parametrization for X-ray spectra that is\nespecially streamlined for higher density plasmas with efficient radiative\ncooling, and provides internal consistency checks on the assumption of\nimpulsive heating followed by complete cooling. The result is no longer model\nindependent, but the results are more directly interpretable in terms of useful\nphysical constraints on the impulsive heating distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2014 19:13:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

Due\nto the increasing number of autonomous heterogeneous devices in future mobile\nnetworks, an efficient resource allocation scheme is required to maximize\nnetwork throughput and achieve higher spectral efficiency. In this paper,\nperformance of network-integrated D2D communication under channel uncertainties\nis investigated where D2D traffic is carried through relay nodes. Considering a\nmulti-user and multi-relay network, we propose a robust distributed solution\nfor resource allocation with a view to maximizing network sum-rate when the\ninterference from other relay nodes and the link gains are uncertain. An\noptimization problem is formulated for allocating radio resources at the relays\nto maximize end-to-end rate as well as satisfy the quality-of-service (QoS)\nrequirements for cellular and D2D user equipments under total power constraint.\nEach of the uncertain parameters is modeled by a bounded distance between its\nestimated and bounded values. We show that the robust problem is convex and a\ngradient-aided dual decomposition algorithm is applied to allocate radio\nresources in a distributed manner. Finally, to reduce the cost of robustness\ndefined as the reduction of achievable sum-rate, we utilize the \\textit{chance\nconstraint approach} to achieve a trade-off between robustness and optimality.\nThe numerical results show that there is a distance threshold beyond which\nrelay-aided D2D communication significantly improves network performance when\ncompared to direct communication between D2D peers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2014 19:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

In order\nto obtain our main theorem we prove a key result on the multiple divisor\nfunctions of level N and then use it to solve a complicated under-determined\nsystem of linear equations by some standard techniques from linear algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2014 22:02:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2015 07:43:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-06"}

The most common practice to\ndeal with these issues is to use another similar or \"closely related\" asset or\nindex which is traded, for hedging purposes. Implicitly, traders assume here\nthat the higher the correlation between the traded and nontraded assets, the\nbetter the hedge is expected to perform. This raises the question as to how\n\\textquoteleft{}closely related\\textquoteright{} the assets really are. In this\npaper, the concept of twin assets is introduced, focusing the discussion\nprecisely in what does it mean for two assets to be similar. Our findings point\nto the fact that, in order to have very similar assets, for example identical\ntwins, high correlation measures are not enough. Specifically, two basic\ncriteria of similarity are pointed out: i) the coefficient of variation of the\nassets and ii) the correlation between assets. From here, a method to measure\nthe level of similarity between assets is proposed, and secondly, an option\npricing model of twin assets is developed. The proposed model allows us to\nprice an option of one nontraded asset using its twin asset, but this time\nknowing explicitly what levels of errors we are facing. Finally, some numerical\nillustrations show how twin assets behave depending upon their levels of\nsimilarities, and how their potential differences will traduce in MAPE (mean\nabsolute percentage error) for the proposed option pricing model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 04:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

However, the advantage of the\nsparsity has not been fully exploited in training phases because it is\ngenerally difficult to know which sample turns out to be SV beforehand. In this\npaper, we introduce a new approach called safe sample screening that enables us\nto identify a subset of the non-SVs and screen them out prior to the training\nphase. Our approach is different from existing heuristic approaches in the\nsense that the screened samples are guaranteed to be non-SVs at the optimal\nsolution. We investigate the advantage of the safe sample screening approach\nthrough intensive numerical experiments, and demonstrate that it can\nsubstantially decrease the computational cost of the state-of-the-art SVM\nsolvers such as LIBSVM.

A key assumption in our treatment is that the wave packet\nsizes of the particles, in particular, the neutrino producing source particles\nand the neutrino absorbing detector particles, are taken to be negligible\ncompared with their mean free path in their respective medium. With this\nassumption, and taking into considerations of the finite time of neutrino\nproduction, neutrino wave packets with well-defined edges are generated. This\nfact, together with the locality of weak interactions, enable us to relate the\npropagation time to the propagation distance, thus doing away with the ad hoc\ntime averaging procedure normally employing in derivations of neutrino\noscillation formula. No assumptions on the particular forms of particle wave\nfunctions; for example, Gaussians, need to be made.

We present and explain the\ncharacteristic response features that each type of density structures in the\nmedium leaves on the forward shock (FS) and reverse shock (RS) dynamics, for\nblast waves with either a long-lived or short-lived RS. We show that, when the\nambient medium density drops, the blast waves exhibit in some cases a period of\nan actual acceleration (even during their deceleration stage), due to adiabatic\ncooling of blast waves. Comparing numerical examples that have different shapes\nof bumps or voids, we propose a number of consistency tests that correct\nmodeling of blast waves needs to satisfy. Our model results successfully pass\nthese tests. Employing a Lagrangian description of blast waves, we perform a\nsophisticated calculation of afterglow emission.

The rod is covered by the textolite biconical\nbushing and has a fluoroplastic insert in the vicinity of the bushing.\nMathematical modeling was used to obtain the parameters of the feed for the\noptimal tabletop form of the radiation pattern. The problem of the\nelectromagnetic radiation was solved for metal-dielectric bodies of rotation by\nmethod of integral equations with further solving of the problem of the\nsynthesis for feed parameters. The dielectric rod feed was fabricated for the\nX-frequency range. Feed amplitude and phase patterns were measured in the\nfrequency range 8.2-12.5 GHz. Presented results of mathematical modeling and\nmeasurements for X-range radiation patterns correlate well. It is shown that\nthis feed increases by 20-25% the quiet zone of the compact range with\nreflector in the form of nonsymmetrical cutting of the paraboloid of revolution\n5.0 x 4.5 m in size in the frequency range 8.5-10.0 GHz as compared to a\nconical horn feed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 09:40:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

The object, SDSS J113323.97+550415.8, exhibits broad\nemission lines and strong variability. While originally classified as a\nsupernova (SN) because of its nondetection in 2005, we detect it in recent and\npast observations over 63 yr and find over a magnitude of rebrightening in the\nlast 2 years. Using high-resolution adaptive optics observations, we constrain\nthe source emission region to be <12 pc and find a disturbed host-galaxy\nmorphology indicative of recent merger activity. Observations taken over more\nthan a decade show narrow [O III] lines, constant ultraviolet emission, broad\nBalmer lines, a constant putative black hole mass over a decade of observations\ndespite changes in the continuum, and optical emission-line diagnostics\nconsistent with an active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, the optical spectra\nexhibit blueshifted absorption, and eventually narrow Fe II and [Ca II]\nemission, each of which is rarely found in AGN spectra. While this peculiar\nsource displays many of the observational properties expected of a potential\nblack hole recoil candidate, some of the properties could also be explained by\na luminous blue variable star (LBV) erupting for decades since 1950, followed\nby a Type IIn SN in 2001. Interpreted as an LBV followed by a SN analogous to\nSN 2009ip, the multi-decade LBV eruptions would be the longest ever observed,\nand the broad Halpha emission would be the most luminous ever observed at late\ntimes (>10 yr), larger than that of unusually luminous supernovae such as SN\n1988Z, suggesting one of the most extreme episodes of pre-SN mass loss ever\ndiscovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 10:51:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 19:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The answer is positive, and is the result\nof the analysis of four lists of flux ropes, including magnetic clouds (MCs),\nobserved at 1 AU. The in situ data for the four lists have been fitted with the\nsame cylindrical force-free field model, which provides an estimation of the\nlocal flux-rope parameters such as its radius and orientation. Since the\nflux-rope distributions have a large dynamic range, we go beyond a simple\nhistogram analysis by developing a partition technique that uniformly\ndistributes the statistical fluctuations over the radius range. By doing so, we\nfind that small flux ropes with radius R<0.1 AU have a steep power-law\ndistribution in contrast to the larger flux ropes (identified as MCs), which\nhave a Gaussian-like distribution. Next, from four CME catalogs, we estimate\nthe expected flux-rope frequency per year at 1 AU. We find that the predicted\nnumbers are similar to the frequencies of MCs observed in situ. However, we\nalso find that small flux ropes are at least ten times too abundant to\ncorrespond to CMEs, even to narrow ones.

This spectral variability is rather well characterized\non a colour-colour and hardness-intensity diagram in terms of suitably defined\nhardness ratios. We suggest the existence of a variability pattern on the\nhardness-intensity diagram and we interpret it in terms of the switch between a\nnear-Eddington and a super-Eddington accretion regime. The transition between\nthe two regimes seems to be driven mostly by changes in the contribution of the\nsoft component, which can be explained in terms of the increasing importance of\nwind emission. The analysis is complemented by an investigation of the\nshort-term time variability of all the sources. In general, no clear\ncorrelation between the spectral and temporal properties is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 11:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

We study one\nsuch geometry, the toroidal one, where the periodic boundary conditions must be\nproperly taken into account.\n  As a tool to study the torus we investigate the properties of various types\nof localized states, similar to the coherent states of the harmonic oscillator,\nwhich are maximally localized in phase space. We consider two alternative\ndefinitions of localized states in the lowest Landau level (LLL) on a torus.\nOne is the projection of the coordinate delta function onto the LLL. Another\ndefinition, proposed by Haldane & Rezayi, is to consider the set of functions\nwhich have all their zeros at a single point. Since all LLL wave functions on a\ntorus, are uniquely defined by the position of their zeros, this defines a set\nof functions that are expected to be localized around the point maximally far\naway from the zeros.\n  These two families of localized states have many properties in common with\nthe coherent states on the plane and on the sphere, e.g. a simple resolution of\nunity and a simple self-reproducing kernel. However, we show that only the\nprojected delta function is maximally localized.\n  We find that because of modular covariance, there are severe restrictions on\nwhich wave functions that are acceptable on the torus. As a result, we can\nwrite down a trial wave function for the $\\nu=\\frac{2}{5}$ state, that respects\nthe modular covariance, and has good numerical overlap with the exact coulomb\nground state.\n  Finally we present preliminary calculations of the antisymmetric component of\nthe viscosity tensor for the proposed, modular covariant, $\\nu=\\frac{2}{5}$\nstate, and find that it is in agreement with theoretical predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 12:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

This is applied to CFHTLenS, a 154 square degree\nimaging survey with a median redshift of 0.7 and an effective number density of\n11 galaxies per square arcminute usable for weak lensing. To account for survey\nmasks we apply a 3D pseudo-Cl approach on weak lensing data, and to avoid\nuncertainties in the highly non-linear regime, we separately analyse radial\nwave numbers k<=1.5h/Mpc and k<=5.0h/Mpc, and angular wavenumbers l~400-5000.\nWe show how one can recover 2D and tomographic power spectra from the full 3D\ncosmic shear power spectra and present a measurement of the 2D cosmic shear\npower spectrum, and measurements of a set of 2-bin and 6-bin cosmic shear\ntomographic power spectra; in doing so we find that using the 3D power in the\ncalculation of such 2D and tomographic power spectra from data naturally\naccounts for a minimum scale in the matter power spectrum. We use 3D cosmic\nshear to constrain cosmologies with parameters OmegaM, OmegaB, sigma8, h, ns,\nw0, wa. For a non-evolving dark energy equation of state, and assuming a flat\ncosmology, lensing combined with WMAP7 results in h=0.78+/-0.12,\nOmegaM=0.252+/-0.079, sigma8=0.88+/-0.23 and w=-1.16+/-0.38 using only scales\nk<=1.5h/Mpc. We also present results of lensing combined with first year Planck\nresults, where we find no tension with the results from this analysis, but we\nalso find no significant improvement over the Planck results alone. We find\nevidence of a suppression of power compared to LCDM on small scales 1.5 < k <\n5.0 h/Mpc in the lensing data, which is consistent with predictions of the\neffect of baryonic feedback on the matter power spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 13:19:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 13:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-06"}

For example, this occurs under\nintermittent interference. We devise the backward retransmission (BRQ) scheme,\nwhich uses the delayed CSIT to send the optimal amount of incremental\nredundancy (IR). BRQ uses fixed-length packets, fixed-rate R transmission\ncodebook, and operates as Markov block coding, where the correlation between\nthe adjacent packets depends on the amount of IR parity bits. When the delayed\nCSIT is full and R grows asymptotically, the average throughput of BRQ becomes\nequal to the value achieved with prior CSIT and a fixed-power transmitter;\nhowever, at the expense of increased delay. The second contribution is a method\nfor employing BRQ when a limited number of feedback bits is available to report\nthe delayed CSIT. The main novelty is the idea to assemble multiple feedback\nopportunities and report multiple SINRs through vector quantization. This\nchallenges the conventional wisdom in ARQ protocols where feedback bits are\nused to only quantize the CSIT of the immediate previous transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 13:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Unlike with the better-known\nMIP, here the assumption is that each Merlin receives an independent random\nchallenge from Arthur. One motivation for this model (which we explore in\ndetail) comes from the close analogies between it and the quantum complexity\nclass QMA(k), but the AM(k) model is also natural in its own right.\n  We illustrate the power of multiple Merlins by giving an AM(2) protocol for\n3SAT, in which the Merlins' challenges and responses consist of only\nn^{1/2+o(1)} bits each. Our protocol has the consequence that, assuming the\nExponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), any algorithm for approximating a dense CSP\nwith a polynomial-size alphabet must take n^{(log n)^{1-o(1)}} time. Algorithms\nnearly matching this lower bound are known, but their running times had never\nbeen previously explained. Brandao and Harrow have also recently used our 3SAT\nprotocol to show quasipolynomial hardness for approximating the values of\ncertain entangled games.\n  In the other direction, we give a simple quasipolynomial-time approximation\nalgorithm for free games, and use it to prove that, assuming the ETH, our 3SAT\nprotocol is essentially optimal. More generally, we show that multiple Merlins\nnever provide more than a polynomial advantage over one: that is, AM(k)=AM for\nall k=poly(n). The key to this result is a subsampling theorem for free games,\nwhich follows from powerful results by Alon et al. and Barak et al. on\nsubsampling dense CSPs, and which says that the value of any free game can be\nclosely approximated by the value of a logarithmic-sized random subgame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 13:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

The components of the nearby binary aCentauri have higher\nthan solar metallicities, which is thought to promote giant planet formation.\nWe aim to determine the level of emission from debris in the aCen system.\nHaving already detected the temperature minimum, Tmin, of aCenA, we here\nattempt to do so also for the companion aCenB. Using the aCen stars as\ntemplates, we study possible effects Tmin may have on the detectability of\nunresolved dust discs around other stars. We use Herschel and APEX photometry\nto determine the stellar spectral energy distributions. In addition, we use\nAPEX for spectral line mapping to study the complex background around aCen seen\nin the photometric images. Models of stellar atmospheres and discs are used to\nestimate the amount of debris around these stars. For solar-type stars, a\nfractional dust luminosity fd 2e-7 could account for SEDs that do not exhibit\nthe Tmin-effect. Slight excesses at the 2.5 sigma level are observed at 24 mu\nfor both stars, which, if interpreted to be due to dust, would correspond to fd\n(1-3)e-5. Dynamical disc modelling leads to rough mass estimates of the\nputative Zodi belts around the aCen stars, viz. <~4e-6 MMoon of 4 to 1000 mu\nsize grains, distributed according to n a^-3.5. Similarly, for filled-in Tmin\nemission, corresponding EKBs could account for ~1e-3 MMoon of dust. Light\nscattered and/or thermally emitted by exo-Zodi discs will have profound\nimplications for future spectroscopic missions designed to search for\nbiomarkers in the atmospheres of Earth-like planets. The F-IR SED of aCenB is\nmarginally consistent with the presence of a minimum temperature region in the\nupper atmosphere.

Assuming a constant dust to gas ratio and homogeneous 1MK\nhot gas filling the cavities, we modeled in a simple way the 0.25 keV surface\nbrightness along the Galactic plane as seen from the Sun, taking into account\nthe absorption by the mapped clouds. The data-model comparison favors the\nexistence of hot gas in the Local Bubble (LB). The average mean pressure in the\nlocal cavities is found to be on the order of about 10,000 cm-3K, in agreement\nwith previous studies. The model overestimates the emission from the huge\ncavities in the 3rd quadrant. Using CaII absorption data, we show that the dust\nto CaII ratio is very small in this region, implying the presence of a large\nquantity of lower temperature (non-X-ray emitting) ionized gas, explaining at\nleast part of the discrepancy. In the meridian plane, the two main brightness\nenhancements coincide well with the chimneys connecting the LB to the halo.

When evasion occurs, both individuals involved in a binary\ninteraction take advantage of it, while the rest of the society is deprived of\na part of the planned redistribution. In general, the effect of evasion on the\nincome distribution is to decrease the population of the middle classes and\nincrease that of the poor and rich classes. We study the dependence of the Gini\nindex on several parameters (mainly taxation rates and evasion rates), also in\nthe case when the evasion rate increases proportionally to a taxation rate\nwhich is perceived by citizens as unfair. Finally, we evaluate the relative\nprobability of class advancement of individuals due to direct interactions and\nwelfare provisions, and some typical temporal rates of convergence of the\nincome distribution to its equilibrium state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 08:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-25"}
