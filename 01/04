Using the Optical/UV Monitor\non board XMM-Newton, we present the very first upper limits of the flux density\nof IRC +10420 in the UV domain (between 1800 and 2250 A, and between 2050 and\n2450 A). Finally, we also report on the detection in this field of 10 X-ray and\n7 UV point sources, and we briefly discuss their properties and potential\ncounterparts at longer wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2014 20:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-06"}

The focus of the workshop was on time domain radio astronomy and sky\nsurveys. For the time domain, the extent to which radio and visible wavelength\nobservations are required to understand several classes of transients was\nstressed, but there are also classes of radio transients for which no visible\nwavelength counterpart is yet known, providing an opportunity for discovery.\nFrom the LSST perspective, the LSST is expected to generate as many as 1\nmillion alerts nightly, which will require even more selective specification\nand identification of the classes and characteristics of transients that can\nwarrant follow up, at radio or any wavelength. The LSST will also conduct a\ndeep survey of the sky, producing a catalog expected to contain over 38 billion\nobjects in it. Deep radio wavelength sky surveys will also be conducted on a\ncomparable time scale, and radio and visible wavelength observations are part\nof the multi-wavelength approach needed to classify and understand these\nobjects. Radio wavelengths are valuable because they are unaffected by dust\nobscuration and, for galaxies, contain contributions both from star formation\nand from active galactic nuclei. The workshop touched on several other topics,\non which there was consensus including the placement of other LSST \"Deep\nDrilling Fields,\" inter-operability of software tools, and the challenge of\nfiltering and exploiting the LSST data stream. There were also topics for which\nthere was insufficient time for full discussion or for which no consensus was\nreached, which included the procedures for following up on LSST observations\nand the nature for future support of researchers desiring to use LSST data\nproducts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2014 20:54:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

This is important because waterworlds lack a silicate\nweathering thermostat so their climate is predicted to be less stable than that\nof planets with exposed continents. In other words, the continuously habitable\nzone for waterworlds is much narrower than for Earth-like planets. A planet's\nwater is partitioned, however, between a surface reservoir, the ocean, and an\ninterior reservoir, the mantle. Plate tectonics transports water between these\nreservoirs on geological timescales. Degassing of melt at mid-ocean ridges and\nserpentinization of oceanic crust depend negatively and positively on seafloor\npressure, respectively, providing a stabilizing feedback on long-term ocean\nvolume. Motivated by Earth's approximately steady-state deep water cycle, we\ndevelop a two-box model of the hydrosphere and derive steady-state solutions to\nthe water partitioning on terrestrial planets. Critically, hydrostatic seafloor\npressure is proportional to surface gravity, so super-Earths with a deep water\ncycle will tend to store more water in the mantle. We conclude that a\ntectonically active terrestrial planet of any mass can maintain exposed\ncontinents if its water mass fraction is less than ~0.2%, dramatically\nincreasing the odds that super-Earths are habitable. The greatest source of\nuncertainty in our study is Earth's current mantle water inventory: the greater\nits value, the more robust planets are to inundation. Lastly, we discuss how\nfuture missions can test our hypothesis by mapping the oceans and continents of\nmassive terrestrial planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2014 20:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-06"}

Several experiments have\nbeen performed by different groups to identify the nature of the collective\nground state in BLG. However, so far, there is no consensus: some experiments\nshow evidence that suggests the establishment of a nematic gapless state, while\nothers present results that are more consistent with the establishment of a\nfully gapped state. Moreover, even among the experiments that appear to see a\nbulk gap, some of the samples are found to be conducting (suggesting existence\nof gapless edge states), while others are insulating.

The\nlatter half of this paper presents the analysis of PAH features in 20\ncarbon-rich post-AGB stars in the LMC, assembled from the Spitzer archive as\nwell as from our own programme. We found that five post-AGB stars showed a\nbroad feature with a peak at 7.7 micron, that had not been classified before.\nFurther, the 10--13 micron PAH spectra were classified into four classes, one\nof which has three broad peaks at 11.3, 12.3 and 13.3 micron rather than two\ndistinct sharp peaks at 11.3 and 12.7 micron, as commonly found in HII regions.\nOur studies suggest that PAHs are gradually processed while the central stars\nevolve from post-AGB phase to PNe, changing their composition before PAHs are\nincorporated into the interstellar medium. Although some metallicity dependence\nof PAH spectra exists, the evolutionary state of an object is more significant\nthan its metallicity in determining the spectral characteristics of PAHs for\nLMC and Galactic post-AGB stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2014 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Usually, a\njet is triggered by a brightening or a flare, which provides the first driving\nforce to push plasma upward. In this process, magnetic reconnection is thought\nto be the mechanism to convert magnetic energy into thermal, nonthermal, and\nkinetic energies. However, most jets could reach an unusual high altitude and\nend much later than the end of its associated flare. This fact implies that\nthere is another way to continuously transfer magnetic energy into kinetic\nenergy even after the reconnection. The picture described above is well known\nin the community, but how and how much magnetic energy is released through a\nway other than reconnection is still unclear. By studying a prominence-like jet\nobserved by SDO/AIA and STEREO-A/EUVI, we find that the continuous relaxation\nof the post-reconnection magnetic field structure is an important process for a\njet to climb up higher than it could through only reconnection. The kinetic\nenergy of the jet gained through the relaxation is 1.6 times that gained from\nthe reconnection. The resultant energy flux is hundreds of times larger than\nthe flux required for the local coronal heating, suggesting that such jets are\na possible source to keep the corona hot. Furthermore, rotational motions\nappear all the time during the jet.

We focus in this paper on the plateau phase whose origin remains\nhighly debated. We confront several newly discovered correlations between\nprompt and afterglow quantities (isotropic emitted energy in gamma-rays,\nluminosity and duration of the plateau) to several models proposed for the\norigin of plateaus in order to check if they can account for these observed\ncorrelations. We first show that the scenario of plateau formation by energy\ninjection into the forward shock leads to an efficiency crisis for the prompt\nphase and therefore study two possible alternatives: the first one still takes\nplace within the framework of the standard forward shock model but allows for a\nvariation of the microphysics parameters to reduce the radiative efficiency at\nearly times; in the second scenario the early afterglow results from a\nlong-lived reverse shock. Its shape then depends on the distribution of energy\nas a function of Lorentz factor in the ejecta. In both cases, we first present\nsimple analytical estimates of the plateau luminosity and duration and then\ncompute detailed light curves. In the two considered scenarios we find that\nplateaus following the observed correlations can be obtained under the\ncondition that specific additional ingredients are included. In the forward\nshock scenario, the preferred model supposes a wind external medium and a\nmicrophysics parameter epsilon_e that first varies as n^{-\\nu} (n being the\nexternal density), with \\nu~1 to get a flat plateau, before staying constant\nbelow a critical density n_0.

In\nthis paper, we propose a context-aware hypergraph similarity measure (CAHSM),\nwhich leads to robust spectral clustering in the case of noisy data. We\nconstruct three types of hypergraph---the pairwise hypergraph, the\nk-nearest-neighbor (kNN) hypergraph, and the high-order over-clustering\nhypergraph. The pairwise hypergraph captures the pairwise similarity of data\npoints; the kNN hypergraph captures the neighborhood of each point; and the\nclustering hypergraph encodes high-order contexts within the dataset. By\ncombining the affinity information from these three hypergraphs, the CAHSM\nalgorithm is able to explore the intrinsic topological information of the\ndataset. Therefore, data clustering using CAHSM tends to be more robust.\nConsidering the intra-cluster compactness and the inter-cluster separability of\nvertices, we further design a discriminative hypergraph partitioning criterion\n(DHPC).

We use GALEX, XMM\nOptical Monitor, and HST data to explore the UV attenuation in the outer parts\nof spiral disks which are backlit by other UV-bright galaxies, starting with\ncandidates provided by Galaxy Zoo participants. Our analysis incorporates\ngalaxy symmetry, using non-overlapping regions of each galaxy to derive error\nestimates on the attenuation measurements. The entire sample has an attenuation\nlaw close to the Calzetti et al. (1994) form; the UV slope for the overall\nsample is substantially shallower than found by Wild et al. (2011), a\nreasonable match to the more distant galaxies in our sample but not to the\nweighted combination including NGC 2207. The nearby, bright spiral NGC 2207\nalone gives accuracy almost equal to the rest of our sample, and its outer arms\nhave a very low level of foreground starlight. This \"grey\" law can be produced\nfrom the distribution of dust alone, without a necessary contribution from\ndifferential escape of stars from dense clouds. The extrapolation needed to\ncompare attenution between backlit galaxies at moderate redshifts, and local\nsystems from SDSS data, is mild enough to allow use of galaxy overlaps to trace\nthe cosmic history of dust. For NGC 2207, the covering factor of clouds with\nsmall optical attenuation becomes a dominant factor farther into the\nultraviolet, which opens the possibility that widespread diffuse dust dominates\nover dust in star-forming regions deep into the ultraviolet.

A detailed analysis of the limit case\n$\\beta\\rightarrow\\infty$ is performed for the seven-dimensional black holes. It\nis shown that for the spherical topology, $P-V$ criticality exists for both the\nuncharged and charged cases. Our results demonstrate again that the charge is\nnot the indispensable condition of $P-V$ criticality. It may be attributed to\nthe effect of higher derivative terms of curvature because similar phenomenon\nwas also found for Gauss-Bonnet black holes. For $k=0$, there would be no $P-V$\ncriticality. Interesting findings occur in the case $k=-1$, in which positive\nsolutions of critical points are found for both the uncharged and charged\ncases. However, the $P-v$ diagram is quite strange. To check whether these\nfindings are physical, we give the analysis on the non-negative definiteness\ncondition of entropy. It is shown that for any nontrivial value of $\\alpha$,\nthe entropy is always positive for any specific volume $v$. Since no $P-V$\ncriticality exists for $k=-1$ in Einstein gravity and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we\ncan relate our findings with the peculiar property of third order Lovelock\ngravity. The entropy in third order Lovelock gravity consists of extra terms\nwhich is absent in the Gauss-Bonnet black holes, which makes the critical\npoints satisfy the constraint of non-negative definiteness condition of\nentropy.

The Vasiliev theories in\nAdS$_{d+1}$, which contain each integer spin once, are related to the $U(N)$\nsinglet sector of the $d$-dimensional CFT of $N$ free complex scalar fields;\nthe minimal theories containing each even spin once -- to the $O(N)$ singlet\nsector of the CFT of $N$ free real scalar fields. Using analytic continuation\nof higher spin zeta functions, which naturally regulate the spin sums, we\ncalculate one loop vacuum energies in Euclidean AdS$_{d+1}$. In even $d$ we\ncompare the result with the $O(N^0)$ correction to the $a$-coefficient of the\nWeyl anomaly; in odd $d$ -- with the $O(N^0)$ correction to the free energy $F$\non the $d$-dimensional sphere. For the theories of integer spins, the\ncorrection vanishes in agreement with the CFT of $N$ free complex scalars. For\nthe minimal theories, the correction always equals the contribution of one real\nconformal scalar field in $d$ dimensions. As explained in arXiv:1308.2337, this\nresult may agree with the $O(N)$ singlet sector of the theory of $N$ real\nscalar fields, provided the coupling constant in the higher spin theory is\nidentified as $G_N\\sim 1/(N-1)$. Our calculations in even $d$ are closely\nrelated to finding the regularized $a$-anomalies of conformal higher spin\ntheories. In each even $d$ we identify two such theories with vanishing\n$a$-anomaly: a theory of all integer spins, and a theory of all even spins\ncoupled to a complex conformal scalar. We also discuss an interacting UV fixed\npoint in $d=5$ obtained from the free scalar theory via an irrelevant\ndouble-trace quartic interaction. This interacting large $N$ theory is dual to\nthe Vasiliev theory in AdS$_6$ where the bulk scalar is quantized with the\nalternate boundary condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2014 15:57:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2014 16:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

The electronic\nbandstructures are calculated by means of the full-potential linear augmented\nplane wave method, using the Tran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson potential. The\ncalculated band gap of 1.23 eV is in agreement with the experimental value of\n1.2 eV. The carrier concentration- and temperature dependent thermoelectric\nproperties of CuGaTe$_2$ are derived, and a figure of merit of $zT= 1.69$ is\nobtained at 950 K for a hole concentration of $3.7\\cdot10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, in\nagreement with a recent experimental finding of $zT= 1.4$, confirming that\nCuGaTe$_2$ is a promising material for high temperature thermoelectric\napplications.

Poorly designed\noutdoor lighting not only wastes energy, money, and valuable Earth resources,\nbut also robs us of our beautiful night sky. Effects of light pollution on the\nnight sky can be evaluated by the skyglow caused by these artificial lighting\nsources, through measurements of the night sky brightness (NSB). The Hong Kong\nNight Sky Brightness Monitoring Network (NSN) was established to monitor in\ndetail the conditions of light pollution in Hong Kong. Monitoring stations were\nset up throughout the city covering a wide range of urban and rural settings to\ncontinuously measure the variations of the NSB. Over 4.6 million night sky\nmeasurements were collected from 18 distinct locations between May 2010 and\nMarch 2013. This huge dataset, over two thousand times larger than our previous\nsurvey, forms the backbone for studies of the temporal and geographical\nvariations of this environmental parameter and its correlation with various\nnatural and artificial factors. The concepts and methodology of the NSN were\npresented here, together with an analysis of the overall night sky conditions\nin Hong Kong. The average NSB in Hong Kong, excluding data affected by the\nMoon, was 16.8 mag arcsec$^{-2}$, or 82 times brighter than the dark site\nstandard established by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).
