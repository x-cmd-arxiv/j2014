These thin sensors are\ndesigned as candidates for the ATLAS pixel detector upgrade to be operated at\nthe HL-LHC, as they ensure radiation hardness at high fluences. They are\ninterconnected to the ATLAS FE-I3 and FE-I4 read-out chips. Moreover, the\nn-in-p technology only requires a single side processing and thereby it is a\ncost-effective alternative to the n-in-n pixel technology presently employed in\nthe LHC experiments. High precision beam test measurements of the hit\nefficiency have been performed on these devices both at the CERN SpS and at\nDESY, Hamburg. We studied the behavior of these sensors at different bias\nvoltages and different beam incident angles up to the maximum one expected for\nthe new Insertable B-Layer of ATLAS and for HL-LHC detectors.

Two main evolutionary channels are\nproposed for the WD to reach the critical density required for a thermonuclear\nexplosion: the single degenerate scenario (SD), in which a CO WD accretes from\na non-degenerate companion, and the double degenerate scenario (DD), in which\ntwo CO WDs merge. However, it remains difficult to reproduce the observed SN Ia\nrate with these two scenarios.\n  With a binary population synthesis code we study the main evolutionary\nchannels that lead to SNe Ia and we calculate the SN Ia rates and the\nassociated delay time distributions. We find that the DD channel is the\ndominant formation channel for the longest delay times. The SD channel with\nhelium-rich donors is the dominant channel at the shortest delay times. Our\nstandard model rate is a factor five lower than the observed rate in galaxy\nclusters.\n  We investigate the influence of ill-constrained aspects of single- and\nbinary-star evolution and uncertain initial binary distributions on the rate of\ntype Ia SNe. These distributions, as well as uncertainties in both helium star\nevolution and common envelope evolution, have the greatest influence on our\ncalculated rates. Inefficient common envelope evolution increases the relative\nnumber of SD explosions such that for $\\alpha_{\\rm ce} = 0.2$ they dominate the\nSN Ia rate. Our highest rate is a factor three less than the galaxy-cluster SN\nIa rate, but compatible with the rate determined in a field-galaxy dominated\nsample. If we assume unlimited accretion onto WDs, to maximize the number of SD\nexplosions, our rate is compatible with the observed galaxy-cluster rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 16:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We perform a detailed study of a sample of subdwarfs to determine their\nstellar parameters and constrain the stat-of-the art atmospheric models.\n  Methods. We present UVES/VLT high resolution spectra of three late-K\nsubdwarfs and 18 M subdwarfs. Our atlas covers the optical region from 6400 AA\nup to the near infrared at 8900 AA. We show spectral details of cool\natmospheres at very high resolution (R= 40 000) and compare with synthetic\nspectra computed from the recent BT-Settl atmosphere models.\n  Results. Our comparison shows that molecular features (TiO, VO, CaH), and\natomic features (Fe I, Ti I, Na I, K I) are well fitted by current models. We\nproduce an effective temperature versus spectral type relation all over the\nsubdwarf spectral sequence.

In particular, the Big Bang nucleosynthesis\nprovides a strong test for every dark matter candidate, since it is well\nstudied and involves relatively few free parameters. The necessity of accurate\nstudies of primordial nucleosynthesis with mirror matter has then emerged. In\norder to fill this lack, I present here the results of accurate numerical\nsimulations of the primordial production of both ordinary nuclides and nuclides\nmade of mirror baryons, in presence of a hidden mirror sector with unbroken\nparity symmetry and with gravitational interactions only. These elements are\nthe building blocks of all the structures forming in the Universe, therefore\ntheir chemical composition is a key ingredient for astrophysics with mirror\ndark matter. The production of ordinary nuclides show differences from the\nstandard model for a ratio of the temperatures between mirror and ordinary\nsectors x = T'/T > 0.3, and they present an interesting decrease of the\nabundance of 7Li. For the mirror nuclides, instead, one observes an enhanced\nproduction of 4He, that becomes the dominant element for x < 0.5, and much\nlarger abundances of heavier elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 17:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-14"}

In both cases, we find that the twisting leads to the expansion\nof the overlying field. As a consequence of the progressively reduced magnetic\ntension, the flux-rope quasi-statically adapts to the changed environmental\nfield, rising slowly. Once the tension is sufficiently reduced, a distinct\nsecond phase of evolution occurs where the flux-rope enters an unstable regime\ncharacterized by a strong acceleration.

Both theory and observations are not yet fully\nconclusive regarding this question, and numerical simulations have,\nsurprisingly, barely been used to address it. Here we quantify the evolution of\nelectric currents during the formation of a bipolar active region by\nconsidering a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the emergence\nof a sub-photospheric, current-neutralized magnetic flux rope into the solar\natmosphere. We find that a strong deviation from current neutralization\ndevelops simultaneously with the onset of significant flux emergence into the\ncorona, accompanied by the development of substantial magnetic shear along the\nactive region's polarity inversion line. After the region has formed and flux\nemergence has ceased, the strong magnetic fields in the region's center are\nconnected solely by direct currents, and the total direct current is several\ntimes larger than the total return current.

We revisit the\nbehavior of in-plane $H_{c2}$ in $d$-wave superconductors by considering both\nthe orbital effect and Pauli paramagnetic effect. After carrying out systematic\nanalysis, we show that the maxima of $H_{c2}$ could be along either nodal or\nantinodal directions of a $d$-wave superconducting gap, depending on the\nspecific values of a number of tuning parameters. This behavior is in contrast\nto the common belief that the maxima of in-plane $H_{c2}$ are along the\ndirection where the superconducting gap takes its maximal value. Therefore,\nidentifying the precise $d$-wave gap symmetry through fitting experiments\nresults of angle-resolved $H_{c2}$ with model calculations at a fixed\ntemperature, as widely used in previous studies, is difficult and practically\nunreliable. However, our extensive analysis of angle-resolved $H_{c2}$ show\nthat there is a critical temperature $T^{*}$: in-plane $H_{c2}$ exhibits its\nmaxima along nodal directions at $T < T^{*}$ and along antinodal directions at\n$T^{*} < T < T_c$. The concrete value of $T^{*}$ may change as other parameters\nvary, but the existence of $\\pi/4$ shift of $H_{c2}$ at $T^{\\ast}$ appears to\nbe a general feature. Thus a better method to identify the precise $d$-wave gap\nsymmetry is to measure $H_{c2}$ at a number of different temperatures, and\nexamine whether there is a $\\pi/4$ shift in its angular dependence at certain\n$T^{*}$. We further show that Landau level mixing does not change this general\nfeature. However, in the presence of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state,\nthe angular dependence of $H_{c2}$ becomes quite complicated, which makes it\nmore difficult to determine the gap symmetry by measuring $H_{c2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 19:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2016 23:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

GLMM extends the linear mixed\nmodels allowing for different types of response variable. Three most common\ndata types are continuous, counts and binary and standard distributions for\nthese types of response variables are Gaussian, Poisson and Binomial,\nrespectively. Despite that flexibility, there are situations where the response\nvariable is continuous, but bounded, such as rates, percentages, indexes and\nproportions. In such situations the usual GLMM's are not adequate because\nbounds are ignored and the beta distribution can be used. Likelihood and\nBayesian inference for beta mixed models are not straightforward demanding a\ncomputational overhead.

However, theoretical models and\nnumerical simulations can result in a slower equator and faster poles when the\nrotation is slow. Aims: We study the critical rotational influence under which\ndifferential rotation flips from solar-like (fast equator, slow poles) to an\nanti-solar one (slow equator, fast poles). We estimate the non-diffusive\n($\\Lambda$ effect) and diffusive (turbulent viscosity) contributions to the\nReynolds stress. Methods: We present the results of three-dimensional numerical\nsimulations of mildly turbulent convection in spherical wedge geometry. Here we\napply a fully compressible setup which would suffer from a prohibitive time\nstep constraint if the real solar luminosity was used. We regulate the\nconvective velocities by varying the amount of heat transported by thermal\nconduction, turbulent diffusion, and resolved convection. Results: Increasing\nthe efficiency of resolved convection leads to a reduction of the rotational\ninfluence on the flow and a sharp transition from solar-like to anti-solar\ndifferential rotation for Coriolis numbers around 1.3. We confirm the recent\nfinding of a large-scale flow bistability: contrasted with running the models\nfrom an initial condition with unprescribed differential rotation, the\ninitialization of the model with certain kind of rotation profile sustains the\nsolution over a wider parameter range. Conclusions: Our results may have\nimplications for real stars that start their lives as rapid rotators implying\nsolar-like rotation in the early main-sequence evolution. As they slow down,\nthey might be able to retain solar-like rotation for lower Coriolis numbers\nbefore switching to anti-solar rotation. This could partially explain the\npuzzling findings of anti-solar rotation profiles for models in the solar\nparameter regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 20:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 06:53:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-17"}

Satellite galaxies in the\nsame groups reach masses as low as twice that of the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(M=6.5x10^9 M\\solar). Using statistical background subtraction, we measure the\naverage rest-frame colors of galaxies in our groups and calculate the evolving\nquiescent fractions of centrals and satellites over seven redshift bins. Our\nanalysis shows clear evidence for star formation quenching in group halos, with\na different quenching onset for centrals and their satellite galaxies. Using\nhalo mass estimates for our central galaxies, we find that star formation shuts\noff in centrals when typical halo masses reach between 10^12 and 10^13 M\\solar,\nconsistent with predictions from the halo quenching model. In contrast,\nsatellite galaxies in the same groups most likely undergo quenching by\nenvironmental processes, whose onset is delayed with respect to their central\ngalaxy. Although star formation is suppressed in all galaxies over time, the\nprocesses that govern quenching are different for centrals and satellites.\nWhile mass plays an important role in determining the star formation activity\nof central galaxies, quenching in satellite galaxies is dominated by the\nenvironment in which they reside.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

According to the design of\nthe halo model, the large-scale power spectra of the various matter components\nare physically connected with the distribution of each component within bound\nstructures and thus, ultimately, with the complete set of physical processes\nthat drive the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Besides being\npractical for cosmological and parametric studies, the semi-analytic model\npresented here has also other advantages. Most importantly, it allows one to\nunderstand on physical ground what is the relative contribution of each matter\ncomponent to the total clustering of mass as a function of scale, and thus it\nopens an interesting new window to infer the distribution of baryons through\nhigh precision cosmic shear measurements. This is particularly relevant for\nfuture wide-field photometric surveys such as Euclid.

Converting these observations to an estimate of the CO J=1-0 intensity,\nand thus inferring H2 gas masses, requires knowledge of the CO excitation\nladder, or spectral line energy distribution (SLED). The few available multi-J\nCO observations of galaxies show a very broad range of SLEDs, even at fixed\ngalaxy mass and star formation rate, making the conversion to J=1-0 emission\nand hence molecular gas mass highly uncertain. Here, we combine numerical\nsimulations of disk galaxies and galaxy mergers with molecular line radiative\ntransfer calculations to develop a model for the physical parameters that drive\nvariations in CO SLEDs in galaxies. An essential feature of our model is a\nfully self-consistent computation of the molecular gas temperature and\nexcitation structure. We find that, while the shape of the SLED is ultimately\ndetermined by difficult-to-observe quantities such as the gas density,\ntemperature, and optical depth distributions, all of these quantities are\nwell-correlated with the galaxy's mean star formation rate surface density\n(Sigma_SFR), which is observable. We use this result to develop a model for the\nCO SLED in terms of Sigma_SFR, and show that this model quantitatively\nreproduces the SLEDs of galaxies over a dynamic range of ~200 in SFR surface\ndensity, at redshifts from z=0-6. This model should make it possible to\nsignificantly reduce the uncertainty in deducing molecular gas masses from\nobservations of high-J CO emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 21:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 19:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

A global custodial $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R$\nsymmetry guarantees that the symmetry breaking in the weak interaction sector\nagrees with electroweak data. The non-Abelian $SU(2)_C$ color dynamics\nsatisfies asymptotic freedom, which resolves the gauge and Higgs mass hierarchy\nproblems and makes the model ultraviolet complete. The composite constituent\ndynamics model can realize a $SU(3)_C\\times SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ electroweak\nand strong interaction model that satisfies the naturalness principle. The\nthree generations of colorless quarks $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ with charges $Q=+1e$\nand $Q=0$, respectively, which are predicted to exist in the composite model\ncan form bound states which can be identified with the spectrum of exotic\nmesons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 22:31:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 21:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-05"}

Some of the\nstellar material does not receive enough energy to escape the potential well of\nthe newly formed neutron star and it falls back on to the core. This fallback\nplays an important role in setting compact remnant masses and has been invoked\nto explain a number of observed phenomena: late-time neutrino emission,\nr-process element production, peculiar supernovae, and long-duration gamma-ray\nbursts. To examine the link between fallback and these observed phenomena, we\nmust understand the nature of fallback and currently, multiple mechanisms have\nbeen proposed that lead to different characteristics of the fallback. In this\npaper, we model a series of three-dimensional explosions by following the\nfallback for two different massive progenitors to study both the nature of the\nfallback and the role of asymmetric explosions on this fallback. One of the\nmost-cited mechanisms behind fallback argues that it is caused by the reverse\nshock produced when the outward moving supernova shock decelerates in the\nrelatively flat density profile of the stellar envelope. We show that this\nmechanism plays a minor, if any, role in driving fallback and most supernova\nfallback is produced by prompt mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 22:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-15"}

The initial structure of the disk significantly affects\nthe Moon forming process, including the Moons mass, its accretion time scale,\nand its isotopic similarity to Earth. The dynamics of the impact event\ndetermines the initial structure of a nearly hydrostatic Moon forming disk.\nHowever, the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic models have been studied separately\nand their connection has not previously been well quantified. Here, we show the\nextent to which the properties of the disk can be inferred from Smoothed\nParticle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations. By using entropy, angular momentum and\nmass distributions of the SPH outputs as approximately conserved quantities, we\ncompute the two dimensional disk structure. We investigate four different\nmodels: (a) standard, the canonical giant impact model, (b) fast spinning\nEarth, a collision between a fast spinning Earth and a small impactor, (c) sub\nEarths, a collision between two objects with half Earths mass, and (d)\nintermediate, a collision of two bodies whose mass ratio is 7:3. Our SPH\ncalculations show that the initial disk has approximately uniform entropy. The\ndisks of the fast spinning Earth and sub Earths cases are hotter and more\nvaporized (80-90% vapor) than the standard case (20%). The intermediate case\nfalls between these values. In the highly vaporized cases, our procedure fails\nto establish a unique surface density profile of the disk because the disk is\nunstable according to the Rayleigh criterion. In these cases, we estimate\nnon-unique disk models by conserving global quantities. We also develop a semi\nanalytic model for the thermal structure of the disk, which requires only two\ninputs: the average entropy and the surface density of the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 00:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-15"}

Overall, these monitoring observations\nreveal several apparent patterns in the behavior of this sample of AXPs: large\nradiative changes in AXPs (including long-lived flux enhancements, short\nbursts, and pulse profile changes) are rare, occurring typically only every few\nyears per source; large radiative changes are almost always accompanied by some\nform of timing anomaly, usually a spin-up glitch; only 20-30% of timing\nanomalies are accompanied by any form of radiative change. We find that AXP\nradiative behavior at the times of radiatively loud glitches is sufficiently\nsimilar to suggest common physical origins. The similarity in glitch properties\nwhen comparing radiatively loud and radiatively silent glitches in AXPs\nsuggests a common physical origin in the stellar interior. Finally, the overall\nsimilarity of AXP and radio pulsar glitches suggests a common physical origin\nfor both phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 06:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The recent detection of mixed modes\nthat contain the signature of rotation in the spectra of Kepler subgiants and\nred giants gives us the opportunity to make progress on this issue.\n  Aims: Our aim is to probe the radial dependance of the rotation profiles for\na sample of Kepler targets. For this purpose, subgiants and early red giants\nare particularly interesting targets because their rotational splittings are\nmore sensitive to the rotation outside the deeper core than is the case for\ntheir more evolved counterparts.\n  Methods: We first extract the rotational splittings and frequencies of the\nmodes for six young Kepler red giants. We then perform a seismic modeling of\nthese stars using the evolutionary codes CESAM2k and ASTEC. By using the\nobserved splittings and the rotational kernels of the optimal models, we\nperform inversions of the internal rotation profiles of the six stars.\n  Results: We obtain estimates of the mean rotation rate in the core and in the\nconvective envelope of these stars. We show that the rotation contrast between\nthe core and the envelope increases during the subgiant branch. Our results\nalso suggest that the core of subgiants spins up with time, contrary to the RGB\nstars whose core has been shown to spin down. For two of the stars, we show\nthat a discontinuous rotation profile with a deep discontinuity reproduces the\nobserved splittings significantly better than a smooth rotation profile.\nInterestingly, the depths that are found most probable for the discontinuities\nroughly coincide with the location of the H-burning shell, which separates the\nlayers that contract from those that expand. These results will bring\nobservational constraints to the scenarios of angular momentum transport in\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 08:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The FD receiver, however,\nsuffers from inevitable self-interference (SI) from the much more powerful\ntransmit signal. Analogue radio-frequency (RF) and baseband, as well as digital\nbaseband, cancellation techniques have been proposed for suppressing the SI,\nbut so far most of the studies have failed to take into account the inherent\nnonlinearities of the transmitter and receiver front-ends. To fill this gap,\nthis article proposes a novel digital nonlinear interference cancellation\ntechnique to mitigate the power amplifier (PA) induced nonlinear SI in a FD\ntransceiver. The technique is based on modeling the nonlinear SI channel, which\nis comprised of the nonlinear PA, the linear multipath SI channel, and the RF\nSI canceller, with a parallel Hammerstein nonlinearity. Stemming from the\nmodeling, and appropriate parameter estimation, the known transmit data is then\nprocessed with the developed nonlinear parallel Hammerstein structure and\nsuppressed from the receiver path at digital baseband. The results illustrate\nthat with a given IIP3 figure for the PA, the proposed technique enables higher\ntransmit power to be used compared to existing linear SI cancellation methods.\nAlternatively, for a given maximum transmit power level, a lower-quality PA\n(i.e., lower IIP3) can be used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 10:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-15"}

The objective of this paper is to\ninvestigate, in the context of bounded financial positions, the class of\nsurplus-invariant acceptance sets. These are characterized by the fact that\nacceptability does not depend on the positive part, or surplus, of a capital\nposition. We argue that surplus invariance is a reasonable requirement from a\nregulatory perspective, because it focuses on the interests of liability\nholders of a financial institution. We provide a dual characterization of\nsurplus-invariant, convex acceptance sets, and show that the combination of\nsurplus invariance and coherence leads to a narrow range of capital adequacy\ntests, essentially limited to scenario-based tests. Finally, we emphasize the\nadvantages of dealing with surplus-invariant acceptance sets as the primary\nobject rather than directly with risk measures, such as loss-based and\nexcess-invariant risk measures, which have been recently studied by Cont,\nDeguest, and He (2013) and by Staum (2013), respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 10:46:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 22:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-05"}

Only continuum, with no traces of emissions, was detected in the\nspectrum obtained in 2009 when the comet was at a distance of 9.86 au.

Furthermore, unlike other formal identities of this\ngeneral nature in quantum field theory (such as the formal expression for the\nLagrangian perturbation of a correlation function), our formula is completely\nwell-defined from the start, i.e. requires no further UV-renormalization. This\nfeature is a result of a cancelation of UV-divergences between various terms in\nour identity.

These allow the model galaxies to\nreduce an inherent tendency to saturate their star-formation efficiency.

The generated\ncircuits can be used directly, or as miters that check the correctness of a\nlogic design. Typically, those techniques generate non-deterministic finite\nstate automata, which can be determinized at a possibly exponential cost.\nRecent results show multiple advantages of using deterministic automata in\nsymbolic and bounded model checking of LTL safety properties. In this paper, we\npresent a technique with a supporting tool that takes a sequential extended\nregular expression specification {\\Phi}, and a logic design implementation S,\nand generates a sequential circuit C, expressed as an And-Inverted-Graph, that\nchecks whether S satisfies {\\Phi}. The technique passes the generated circuit C\nto ABC, a bounded model checker, to validate correctness. We use free input\nvariables to encode the non- determinism in {\\Phi} and we obtain a number of\nstates in miter linear in the size of {\\Phi}. Our technique succeeds to\ngenerate the input to the model checker while other techniques fail because of\nthe exponential blowup, and in most cases, ABC succeeds to either find defects\nin the design that was otherwise uncheckable, or validate the design. We\nevaluated our technique against several industrial benchmarks including the IBM\narbiter, a load balancer, and a traffic light system, and compared our results\nwith the NuSMV framework.

We find a large diversity of HI masses and\nmorphologies within both families. Surprisingly, SRs are detected as often,\nhost as much HI and have a similar rate of HI discs/rings as FRs. Accretion of\nHI is therefore not always linked to the growth of an inner stellar disc. The\nweak relation between HI and stellar disc is confirmed by their frequent\nkinematical misalignment in FRs, including cases of polar and counterrotating\ngas. In SRs the HI is usually polar. This complex picture highlights a\ndiversity of ETG formation histories which may be lost in the relative\nsimplicity of their inner structure and emerges when studying their outer\nregions.\n  We find that LCDM hydrodynamical simulations have difficulties reproducing\nthe HI properties of ETGs.

The\nagent's action at each time step is to specify the probability distribution for\nthe next state given the current state. Following the set-up of Todorov, the\nstate-action cost at each time step is a sum of a state cost and a control cost\ngiven by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the agent's next-state\ndistribution and that determined by some fixed passive dynamics. The online\naspect of the problem is due to the fact that the state cost functions are\ngenerated by a dynamic environment, and the agent learns the current state cost\nonly after selecting an action. An explicit construction of a computationally\nefficient strategy with small regret (i.e., expected difference between its\nactual total cost and the smallest cost attainable using noncausal knowledge of\nthe state costs) under mild regularity conditions is presented, along with a\ndemonstration of the performance of the proposed strategy on a simulated target\ntracking problem.

The new algorithm proposed here is aimed at\nrevealing these key connections by measuring a node's vicinity to nodes of\nanother community.

The method relies on independent random walks\nof a chosen fixed number of steps, originating from nodes with edges in more\nthan one community.

As its primary physics goal, IAXO will look for axions or\naxion-like particles (ALPs) originating in the Sun via the Primakoff conversion\nof the solar plasma photons. In terms of signal-to-noise ratio, IAXO will be\nabout 4-5 orders of magnitude more sensitive than CAST, currently the most\npowerful axion helioscope, reaching sensitivity to axion-photon couplings down\nto a few $\\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ and thus probing a large fraction of the\ncurrently unexplored axion and ALP parameter space. IAXO will also be sensitive\nto solar axions produced by mechanisms mediated by the axion-electron coupling\n$g_{ae}$ with sensitivity $-$for the first time$-$ to values of $g_{ae}$ not\npreviously excluded by astrophysics. With several other possible physics cases,\nIAXO has the potential to serve as a multi-purpose facility for generic axion\nand ALP research in the next decade. In this paper we present the conceptual\ndesign of IAXO, which follows the layout of an enhanced axion helioscope, based\non a purpose-built 20m-long 8-coils toroidal superconducting magnet. All the\neight 60cm-diameter magnet bores are equipped with focusing x-ray optics, able\nto focus the signal photons into $\\sim 0.2$ cm$^2$ spots that are imaged by\nultra-low-background Micromegas x-ray detectors. The magnet is built into a\nstructure with elevation and azimuth drives that will allow for solar tracking\nfor $\\sim$12 h each day.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 15:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

In the past\nyears, some evaluation methods are presented that utilize only a single feature\nlike color feature to detect similarity between automatic video summaries and\nground-truth user summaries. One of the drawbacks of using a single feature is\nthat sometimes it gives a false similarity detection which makes the assessment\nof the quality of the generated video summary less perceptual and not accurate.\nIn this paper, a novel method for evaluating automatic video summaries is\npresented. This method is based on comparing automatic video summaries\ngenerated by video summarization techniques with ground-truth user summaries.\nThe objective of this evaluation method is to quantify the quality of video\nsummaries, and allow comparing different video summarization techniques\nutilizing both color and texture features of the video frames and using the\nBhattacharya distance as a dissimilarity measure due to its advantages. Our\nExperiments show that the proposed evaluation method overcomes the drawbacks of\nother methods and gives a more perceptual evaluation of the quality of the\nautomatic video summaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 09:30:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 23:04:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 16:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

Here we review that approach, together\nwith the functional Taylor expansion that the KPZ nonequilibrium potential\n(NEP) admits. Such expansion becomes naturally truncated at third order, giving\nrise to a nonlinear stochastic partial differential equation to be regarded as\na gradient-flow counterpart to the KPZ equation. A dynamic renormalization\ngroup analysis at one-loop order of this new mesoscopic model yields the KPZ\nscaling relation alpha+z=2, as a consequence of the exact cancelation of the\ndifferent contributions to vertex renormalization. This result is quite\nremarkable, considering the lower degree of symmetry of this equation, which is\nin particular not Galilean invariant. In addition, this scheme is exploited to\ninquire about the dynamical behavior of the KPZ equation through a\npath-integral approach. Each of these aspects offers novel points of view and\nsheds light on particular aspects of the dynamics of the KPZ equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 19:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-27"}
