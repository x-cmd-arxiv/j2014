In contrast, the\namplitude of the BAO feature has received relatively little study, mainly due\nto limited signal-to-noise, and complications due to galaxy biasing, effects of\nnon-linear clustering and dependence on several cosmological parameters. As\nexpected, the amplitude of the BAO feature is sensitive to the cosmic baryon\nfraction: for standard radiation content, the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nacoustic peaks constrain this precisely and the BAO amplitude is largely a\nredundant cross-check. However, the CMB mainly constrains the redshift of\nmatter-radiation equality, z_eq, and the baryon/photon ratio: if a non-standard\nradiation density N_eff is allowed, increasing N_eff while matching the CMB\npeaks leads to a reduced baryon fraction and a lower relative BAO amplitude. We\nconstruct an observable for the relative area of the BAO feature from the\ngalaxy correlation function (Eq.~8); from linear-theory models, we find that\nthis is mainly sensitive to N_eff and quite insensitive to other cosmological\nparameters. More detailed work from N-body simulations will be needed to\nconstrain the effects of non-linearity and scale-dependent galaxy bias on this\nobservable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 16:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-20"}

The main\nnovelty of the present contribution consists in the fact that the effects of\ntemperature on the flow are taken into account. In the mathematical model, the\nevolution of the macroscopic velocity is ruled by the Navier-Stokes system with\ntemperature-dependent viscosity, while the order parameter representing the\nconcentration of one of the components of the fluid is assumed to satisfy a\nconvective Cahn-Hilliard equation. The effects of the temperature are\nprescribed by a suitable form of the heat equation. However, due to quadratic\nforcing terms, this equation is replaced, in the weak formulation, by an\nequality representing energy conservation complemented with a differential\ninequality describing production of entropy. The main advantage of introducing\nthis notion of solution is that, while the thermodynamical consistency is\npreserved, at the same time the energy-entropy formulation is more tractable\nmathematically. Indeed, global-in-time existence for the initial-boundary value\nproblem associated to the weak formulation of the model is proved by deriving\nsuitable a-priori estimates and showing weak sequential stability of families\nof approximating solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 16:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-15"}

Eventually, these stars can travel through the\nmolecular clouds, which are highly inhomogeneous. The powerful winds of massive\nrunaway stars interact with the medium forming bowshocks. Recent observations\nand theoretical modelling suggest that these bowshocks emit non-thermal\nradiation. As the massive stars move through the inhomogeneous ambient gas the\nphysical properties of the bowshocks are modified, producing changes in the\nnon-thermal emission. We aim to compute the non-thermal radiation produced in\nthe bowshocks of runaway massive stars when travelling through a molecular\ncloud. We calculate the non-thermal emission and absorption for two types of\nmassive runaway stars, an O9I and an O4I, as they move through a density\ngradient.

Thus, the development of ab initio methods that allow\nfor an accurate and computationally inexpensive treatment of charge-transfer\nexcitations is a topic that nowadays attracts a lot of scientific attention. In\nthis paper we extend an approach recently introduced for the description of\nsingle and double excitations (M. Tassi, I. Theophilou and S. Thanos, Int. J.\nQuantum Chem., (113), 690 (2013), M.

We describe an excitation where an\nelectron is transferred from a donor system to an acceptor one, keeping the\nexcited state orthogonal to the ground state and avoiding variational collapse.\nThese conditions are achieved by decomposing the space spanned by the\nHartree-Fock (HF) ground state orbitals into four subspaces: The subspace\nspanned by the occupied orbitals that are localized in the region of the donor\nmolecule, the corresponding for the acceptor ones and two more subspaces\ncontaining the virtual orbitals that are localized in the neighborhood of the\ndonor and the acceptor, respectively. Next, we create a Slater determinant with\na hole in the subspace of occupied orbitals of the donor and a particle in the\nvirtual subspace of the acceptor. Subsequently we optimize both the hole and\nthe particle by minimizing the HF energy functional in the corresponding\nsubspaces. Finally, we test our approach by calculating the lowest\ncharge-transfer excitation energies for a set of tetracyanoethylene-hydrocarbon\ncomplexes, that have been used earlier as a test set for such kind of\nexcitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 18:02:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 17:53:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 13:08:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2014 14:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-25"}

Traditionally,\npredictive compression focused on the lossless and near-lossless modes of\noperation where the maximum error can be bounded but the rate of the compressed\nimage is variable. Rate control is considered a challenging problem for\npredictive encoders due to the dependencies between quantization and prediction\nin the feedback loop, and the lack of a signal representation that packs the\nsignal's energy into few coefficients. In this paper, we show that it is\npossible to design a rate control scheme intended for onboard implementation.\nIn particular, we propose a general framework to select quantizers in each\nspatial and spectral region of an image so as to achieve the desired target\nrate while minimizing distortion. The rate control algorithm allows to achieve\nlossy, near-lossless compression, and any in-between type of compression, e.g.,\nlossy compression with a near-lossless constraint. While this framework is\nindependent of the specific predictor used, in order to show its performance,\nin this paper we tailor it to the predictor adopted by the CCSDS-123 lossless\ncompression standard, obtaining an extension that allows to perform lossless,\nnear-lossless and lossy compression in a single package. We show that the rate\ncontroller has excellent performance in terms of accuracy in the output rate,\nrate-distortion characteristics and is extremely competitive with respect to\nstate-of-the-art transform coding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 18:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-15"}

However,\ncurrent methods do not allow for individual variation in parameters, such as\ndetection or survival probability. Here we develop misidentification models for\ncapture-recapture data that can simultaneously account for temporal variation,\nbehavioral effects and individual heterogeneity in parameters. To facilitate\nBayesian inference using our approach, we extend standard probit regression\ntechniques to latent multinomial models where the dimension and zeros of the\nresponse cannot be observed. We also present a novel Metropolis-Hastings within\nGibbs algorithm for fitting these models using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Using\nclosed population abundance models for illustration, we re-visit a DNA\ncapture-recapture population study of black bears in Michigan, USA and find\nevidence of misidentification due to genotyping error, as well as temporal,\nbehavioral and individual variation in detection probability. We also estimate\na salamander population of known size from laboratory experiments evaluating\nthe effectiveness of a marking technique commonly used for amphibians and fish.\nOur model was able to reliably estimate the size of this population and\nprovided evidence of individual heterogeneity in misidentification probability\nthat is attributable to variable mark quality. Our approach is more\ncomputationally demanding than previously proposed methods, but it provides the\nflexibility necessary for a much broader suite of models to be explored while\nproperly accounting for uncertainty introduced by misidentification and\nimperfect detection. In the absence of misidentification, our probit\nformulation also provides a convenient and efficient Gibbs sampler for Bayesian\nanalysis of traditional closed population capture-recapture data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 19:14:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 18:44:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 20:59:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 12:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

We are motivated to revisit this older formulation of dynamical\ntriangulations by hints from renormalization group approaches that gravity may\nbe asymptotically safe and by the emergence of a semiclassical phase in causal\ndynamical triangulations (CDT). We study the phase diagram of this model and\nidentify the two phases that are well known from previous work: the branched\npolymer phase and the collapsed phase. We verify that the order of the phase\ntransition dividing the branched polymer phase from the collapsed phase is\nalmost certainly first-order. The nontrivial measure term enlarges the phase\ndiagram, allowing us to explore a region of the phase diagram that has been\ndubbed the crinkled region. Although the collapsed and branched polymer phases\nhave been studied extensively in the literature, the crinkled region has not\nreceived the same scrutiny. We find that the crinkled region is likely a part\nof the collapsed phase with particularly large finite-size effects.\nIntriguingly, the behavior of the spectral dimension in the crinkled region at\nsmall volumes is similar to that of CDT, as first reported in arXiv:1104.5505,\nbut for sufficiently large volumes the crinkled region does not appear to have\n4-dimensional semiclassical features.

By a systematic analysis of\nmagnetic point groups, we show that the ME sum rule is applicable to a broad\nvariety of non-centrosymmetric magnets including ME multiferroic compounds. Due\nto the dynamical ME effect, the optical excitations in these materials can\nexhibit directional dichroism, i.e. the absorption coefficient can be different\nfor counter-propagating light beams. According to the ME sum rule, the\nmagnitude of the linear ME effect of a material is mainly determined by the\ndirectional dichroism of its low-energy optical excitations. Application of the\nsum rule to the multiferroic Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$, Sr$_2$CoSi$_2$O$_7$ and\nCa$_2$CoSi$_2$O$_7$ shows that in these compounds the static ME effect is\nmostly governed by the directional dichroism of the spin-wave excitations in\nthe GHz-THz spectral range.

On\nthe one hand, as a counter example to NIST SP800-22 test suite, it is easy to\nconstruct functions that are considered as GOOD pseudorandom generators by NIST\nSP800-22 test suite though the output of these functions are easily\ndistinguishable from the uniform distribution. Thus these functions are not\npseudorandom generators by definition. On the other hand, NIST SP800-22 does\nnot cover some of the important laws for randomness. Two fundamental limit\ntheorems about random binary strings are the central limit theorem and the law\nof the iterated logarithm (LIL). Several frequency related tests in NIST\nSP800-22 cover the central limit theorem while no NIST SP800-22 test covers\nLIL.\n  This paper proposes techniques to address the above challenges that NIST\nSP800-22 testing suite faces. Firstly, we propose statistical distance based\ntesting techniques for (pseudo) random generators to reduce the above mentioned\nType II errors in NIST SP800-22 test suite. Secondly, we propose LIL based\nstatistical testing techniques, calculate the probabilities, and carry out\nexperimental tests on widely used pseudorandom generators by generating around\n30TB of pseudorandom sequences. The experimental results show that for a sample\nsize of 1000 sequences (2TB), the statistical distance between the generated\nsequences and the uniform distribution is around 0.07 (with $0$ for\nstatistically indistinguishable and $1$ for completely distinguishable) and the\nroot-mean-square deviation is around 0.005.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 19:46:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-15"}

This data release is comprised\nof all transient sources brighter than r~22.5 mag with no history of\nvariability prior to 2004. Dedicated spectroscopic observations were performed\non a subset of 889 transients, as well as spectra for thousands of transient\nhost galaxies using the SDSS-III BOSS spectrographs. Photometric\nclassifications are provided for the candidates with good multi-color light\ncurves that were not observed spectroscopically. From these observations, 4607\ntransients are either spectroscopically confirmed, or likely to be, supernovae,\nmaking this the largest sample of supernova candidates ever compiled. We\npresent a new method for SN host-galaxy identification and derive host-galaxy\nproperties including stellar masses, star-formation rates, and the average\nstellar population ages from our SDSS multi-band photometry. We derive SALT2\ndistance moduli for a total of 1443 SN Ia with spectroscopic redshifts as well\nas photometric redshifts for a further 677 purely-photometric SN Ia candidates.\nUsing the spectroscopically confirmed subset of the three-year SDSS-II SN Ia\nsample and assuming a flat Lambda-CDM cosmology, we determine Omega_M = 0.315\n+/- 0.093 (statistical error only) and detect a non-zero cosmological constant\nat 5.7 sigmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 20:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-04"}

The method is inspired by the\ntheory of nonlocality of physical interactions and utilizes the relevant\nformalism. We formulate the ISP as a problem whose goal is to determine an\nunknown interaction potential $V$ from external scattering data. Although we\nseek a local (diagonally-dominated) $V$ as the solution to the posed problem,\nwe allow $V$ to be nonlocal at the intermediate stages of iterations. This\nallows us to utilize the one-to-one correspondence between $V$ and the T-matrix\nof the problem, $T$. Here it is important to realize that not every $T$\ncorresponds to a diagonal $V$ and we, therefore, relax the usual condition of\nstrict diagonality (locality) of $V$. An iterative algorithm is proposed in\nwhich we seek $T$ that is (i) compatible with the measured scattering data and\n(ii) corresponds to an interaction potential $V$ that is as\ndiagonally-dominated as possible. We refer to this algorithm as to the\ndata-compatible T-matrix completion (DCTMC). This paper is Part I in a two-part\nseries and contains theory only.

Here we address this issue by studying the\nimpact of the pressure Hessian as well as viscous diffusion on the statistics\nof the velocity gradient tensor in the framework of an exact statistical\nevolution equation. This evolution equation shares similarities with earlier\nphenomenological models for the Lagrangian velocity gradient tensor evolution,\nyet constitutes the starting point for a systematic study of the unclosed\npressure Hessian and viscous diffusion terms. Based on the assumption of\nincompressible Gaussian velocity fields, closed expressions are obtained as the\nresults of an evaluation of the characteristic functionals. The benefits and\nshortcomings of this Gaussian closure are discussed, and a generalization is\nproposed based on results from direct numerical simulations. This enhanced\nGaussian closure yields, for example, insights on how the pressure Hessian\nprevents the finite-time singularity induced by the local self-amplification\nand how its interaction with viscous effects leads to the characteristic strain\nskewness phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 21:03:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 08:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-03"}

The excellent data quality allows us to reach a mean\nnumber density of source galaxies of ~109 per sq. arcmin, which improves both\nresolution and significance of the mass reconstruction compared to a previous\nstudy based on Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) images. We take care in\nremoving instrumental effects such as the trailing of charge due to radiation\ndamage of the ACS detector and the position-dependent point spread function\n(PSF). This new ACS analysis confirms the previous claims that a substantial\namount of dark mass is present between two luminous subclusters. We examine the\ndistribution of cluster galaxies and observe very little light at this\nlocation. We find that the centroid of the dark peak in the current ACS\nanalysis is offset to the southwest by ~1 arcmin with respect to the centroid\nfrom the WFPC2 analysis. Interestingly, this new centroid is in better spatial\nagreement with the location where the X-ray emission is strongest, and the\nmass-to-light ratio estimated with this centroid is much higher 813+-78\nM_sun/L_Rsun than the previous value; the aperture mass based on the WFPC2\ncentroid provides a slightly lower, but consistent mass.

Two competing approaches have\nbeen the clonal selection theory and the idiotypic-network theory, each\nstemming from a relatively separate set of principles. One recent perspective\nholding the promise of unification is that of immunity as computation, that is,\nof immunity as the process of computing the state of the body so that\nprotection can be effected, as well as boosted through learning. Here we\ninvestigate the use of cellular automata (CA) as the core abstraction\nsupporting this new perspective. Our choice of CA for this role is based on the\npotential variety of basins in a CA attractor field. Associating each basin\nwith a consistent set of body states, and moreover providing for the noisy\nevolution of the CA in time so that jumping between basins is possible, have\nprovided the necessary backdrop. Given a CA rule to be followed by all cells\nsynchronously, our model is based on a probability with which each cell, at\neach time step, independently updates its own state differently than the rule\nmandates. Setting up and solving the corresponding Markov chain for its\nstationary probabilities have revealed that already in the context of\nelementary CA there exist rules that, while allowing transitions between\nbasins, display remarkable resiliency in terms of basin occupation. For these\nrules, the long-run probability that the CA is found in a given basin is\npractically the same as in the deterministic case when the initial CA state is\nchosen uniformly at random. We argue that, consequently, our single-parameter\nCA model may be a suitable abstraction of immunity as computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 21:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-13"}

It is now viewed as a\ncommon, though still poorly understood, phenomenon in low-mass star formation.\nThe FU Orionis objects (FUors) are long-studied examples of this phenomenon.\nFUors are believed to undergo accretion outbursts during which the accretion\nrate rapidly increases from typically $10^{-7}$ to a few $10^{-4}$ $M_\\odot$\nyr$^{-1}$, and remains elevated over several decades or more. EXors, a loosely\ndefined class of pre-main sequence stars, exhibit shorter and repetitive\noutbursts, associated with lower accretion rates. The relationship between the\ntwo classes, and their connection to the standard pre-main sequence\nevolutionary sequence, is an open question: do they represent two distinct\nclasses, are they triggered by the same physical mechanism, and do they occur\nin the same evolutionary phases? Over the past couple of decades, many\ntheoretical and numerical models have been developed to explain the origin of\nFUor and EXor outbursts.

The system currently contains two types of detector\nmodules: 84 microPET R4 block detectors with 2.2 mm crystals to provide a large\ndetecting area; and 32 Inveon block detectors with 1.5 mm crystals to provide\nhigher spatial resolution. Outputs of the four microPET block detectors in a\nmodular housing are concatenated by a custom printed circuit board to match the\noutput characteristics of an Inveon detector. All the detectors are read out by\nQuickSilver electronics. The detector modules are configured to full rings with\na 15 cm diameter trans-axial field of view (FOV) for dynamic tomographic\nimaging of small plants. Potentially, the Inveon detectors can be reconfigured\nto quarter-rings to get a 25 cm FOV using step-and-shoot motion. The imager\ncontains 2 linear stages to position detectors at different heights for\nmulti-bed scanning, and 2 rotation stages to collect coincidence events from\nall angles. The PET system has been built and integrated into the PGC.

Atoms or ions as well as color centers in crystals offer\nsuitable two-level systems for absorbing incoming photons. To obtain a reliable\ntransfer of coherence, strong enough light-matter interaction is required,\nwhich may enforce use of ensembles of absorbers, but has the disadvantage of\nunavoidable inhomogeneities leading to fast dephasing. This obstacle can be\novercome by echo techniques that allow recovery of the information as long as\nthe coherence is preserved. Albeit semiconductor quantum structures appear\nappealing for information storage due to the large oscillator strength of\noptical transitions, inhomogeneity typically is even more pronounced for them\nand most importantly the optical coherence is limited to nanoseconds or\nshorter. Here we show that by transferring the information to electron spins\nthe storage times for the optical coherence can be extended by orders of\nmagnitude up to the spin relaxation time. From the spin reservoir it can be\nretrieved on purpose by inducing a stimulated photon echo.

There are two main\ncategories of methods for building calibrated classifiers. One approach is to\ndevelop methods for learning probabilistic models that are well-calibrated, ab\ninitio. The other approach is to use some post-processing methods for\ntransforming the output of a classifier to be well calibrated, as for example\nhistogram binning, Platt scaling, and isotonic regression. One advantage of the\npost-processing approach is that it can be applied to any existing\nprobabilistic classification model that was constructed using any\nmachine-learning method.\n  In this paper, we first introduce two measures for evaluating how well a\nclassifier is calibrated. We prove three theorems showing that using a simple\nhistogram binning post-processing method, it is possible to make a classifier\nbe well calibrated while retaining its discrimination capability. Also, by\ncasting the histogram binning method as a density-based non-parametric binary\nclassifier, we can extend it using two simple non-parametric density estimation\nmethods. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed calibration methods on\nsynthetic and real datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethods either outperform or are comparable to existing calibration methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2014 23:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-16"}

To\nunderstand the energy transfers that occur during the development of an extreme\nevent we perform a spatially localized analysis of the energy distribution\nalong different wavenumbers by means of the Gabor transform. A stochastic\nanalysis of the Gabor coefficients reveals i) the low-dimensionality of the\nintermittent structures, ii) the interplay between non-Gaussian statis- tical\nproperties and nonlinear energy transfers between modes, as well as iii) the\ncritical scales (or critical Gabor coefficients) where a critical amount of\nenergy can trigger the formation of an extreme event. We analyze the unstable\ncharacter of these special localized modes directly through the system equation\nand show that these intermittent events are due to the interplay of the system\nnonlinearity, the wave dispersion, and the wave dissipation which mimics wave\nbreaking. These localized instabilities are triggered by random localizations\nof energy in space, created by the dispersive propagation of low-amplitude\nwaves with random phase.

These bottom\nheavy IMFs have more low-mass stars relative to the number of high mass stars,\nand therefore naturally result in proportionally fewer neutron stars and black\nholes. In this paper, we specifically predict the variation in the number of\nblack holes and neutron stars based on the power-law IMF variation required to\nreproduce the observed mass-to-light ratio trends with galaxy mass. We then\ntest whether such variations are observed by studying the field low-mass X-ray\nbinary populations (LMXBs) of nearby early-type galaxies. In these binaries, a\nneutron star or black hole accretes matter from a low-mass donor star. Their\nnumber is therefore expected to scale with the number of black holes and\nneutron stars present in a galaxy. We find that the number of LMXBs per K-band\nlight is similar among the galaxies in our sample. These data therefore\ndemonstrate the uniformity of the slope of the IMF from massive stars down to\nthose now dominating the K-band light, and are consistent with an invariant\nIMF. Our results are inconsistent with an IMF which varies from a\nKroupa/Chabrier like IMF for low mass galaxies to a steep power-law IMF (with\nslope $x$=2.8) for high mass galaxies. We discuss how these observations\nconstrain the possible forms of the IMF variations and how future Chandra\nobservations can enable sharper tests of the IMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 01:44:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 02:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In this work, we focus on a\ndiffusion-based communication system where the reception process is an\nabsorption via receptors. Whenever a molecule hits to the receiver it is\nremoved from the environment. This kind of reception process is called first\npassage process and it is more complicated compared to diffusion process only.\nIn 3-D environments, obtaining analytical solution for hitting time\ndistribution for realistic cases is complicated, hence we develop an end-to-end\nsimulator for he diffusion-based communication system that sends consecutive\nsymbols.\n  In CvD, each symbol is modulated and demodulated in a time slot called symbol\nduration, however the long tail distribution of hitting time is the main\nchallenge that affects the symbol detection error. The molecules arriving in\nthe following slots become an interference source when detection takes place.\nEnd-to-end simulator enables us to analyze the effect of inter symbol\ninterference (ISI) without making any assumptions on the ISI. We propose an ISI\ncancellation technique that utilizes decision feedback for compensating the\neffect of previously demodulated symbol. Three different modulation types are\nconsidered with pulse, square, and cosine carrier waves. In case of constraints\non transmitter or receiver node it may not be possible to use pulse as a\ncarrier, and peak-to-average messenger molecule metric is defined for this\npurpose. Results show that, the proposed ISI mitigation technique improves the\nsymbol detection performance and the amplitude-based modulations are improved\nmore than frequency-based modulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 02:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-16"}

Our\nanalysis shows that matrices satisfying the UP, such as randomly subsampled\nFourier or i.i.d.

To compute democratic representations at low\ncomputational complexity, we present two new, efficient convex optimization\nalgorithms.

The goal is to provide an update operator that is intuitive, in that its\ndefinition is based on a recursive decomposition of the update sentences\nstructure, and that may be reasonably implemented. In addressing update, we\nfirst provide a definition phrased in terms of the models of a knowledge base.\nWhile this operator satisfies a core group of the benchmark Katsuno-Mendelzon\nupdate postulates, not all of the postulates are satisfied. Other\nKatsuno-Mendelzon postulates can be obtained by suitably restricting the\nsyntactic form of the sentence for update, as we show. In restricting the\nsyntactic form of the sentence for update, we also obtain a hierarchy of update\noperators with Winsletts standard semantics as the most basic interesting\napproach captured. We subsequently give an algorithm which captures this\napproach; in the general case the algorithm is exponential, but with some\nnot-unreasonable assumptions we obtain an algorithm that is linear in the size\nof the knowledge base. Hence the resulting approach has much better complexity\ncharacteristics than other operators in some situations.

Each agent ranks all the possible alternatives, and based on this, an\naggregate ranking of the alternatives (or at least a winning alternative) is\nproduced. However, when there are many alternatives, it is impractical to\nsimply ask agents to report their complete preferences. Rather, the agents\npreferences, or at least the relevant parts thereof, need to be elicited. This\nis done by asking the agents a (hopefully small) number of simple queries about\ntheir preferences, such as comparison queries, which ask an agent to compare\ntwo of the alternatives. Prior work on preference elicitation in voting has\nfocused on the case of unrestricted preferences. It has been shown that in this\nsetting, it is sometimes necessary to ask each agent (almost) as many queries\nas would be required to determine an arbitrary ranking of the alternatives. In\ncontrast, in this paper, we focus on single-peaked preferences. We show that\nsuch preferences can be elicited using only a linear number of comparison\nqueries, if either the order with respect to which preferences are\nsingle-peaked is known, or at least one other agents complete preferences are\nknown. We show that using a sublinear number of queries does not suffice. We\nalso consider the case of cardinally single-peaked preferences. For this case,\nwe show that if the alternatives cardinal positions are known, then an agents\npreferences can be elicited using only a logarithmic number of queries;\nhowever, we also show that if the cardinal positions are not known, then a\nsublinear number of queries does not suffice. We present experimental results\nfor all elicitation algorithms. We also consider the problem of only eliciting\nenough information to determine the aggregate ranking, and show that even for\nthis more modest objective, a sublinear number of queries per agent does not\nsuffice for known ordinal or unknown cardinal positions.

In contrast, humans generally do not\nhave much difficulty with social dilemmas, as they are able to balance personal\nbenefit and group benefit. As agents in multi-agent systems are regularly\nconfronted with social dilemmas, for instance in tasks such as resource\nallocation, these agents may benefit from the inclusion of mechanisms thought\nto facilitate human fairness. Although many of such mechanisms have already\nbeen implemented in a multi-agent systems context, their application is usually\nlimited to rather abstract social dilemmas with a discrete set of available\nstrategies (usually two). Given that many real-world examples of social\ndilemmas are actually continuous in nature, we extend this previous work to\nmore general dilemmas, in which agents operate in a continuous strategy space.\nThe social dilemma under study here is the well-known Ultimatum Game, in which\nan optimal solution is achieved if agents agree on a common strategy.

Forming effective\ncoalitions is a major research challenge in the field of multi-agent systems.\nCentral to this endeavour is the problem of determining which of the many\npossible coalitions to form in order to achieve some goal. This usually\nrequires calculating a value for every possible coalition, known as the\ncoalition value, which indicates how beneficial that coalition would be if it\nwas formed. Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a\ncombination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one\ncoalition, and by which the overall outcome of the system is maximized.\nHowever, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging\ndue to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows\nexponentially with the number of agents involved. To date, therefore, many\nalgorithms have been proposed to solve this problem using different techniques\nranging from dynamic programming, to integer programming, to stochastic search\nall of which suffer from major limitations relating to execution time, solution\nquality, and memory requirements.\n  With this in mind, we develop an anytime algorithm to solve the coalition\nstructure generation problem. Specifically, the algorithm uses a novel\nrepresentation of the search space, which partitions the space of possible\nsolutions into sub-spaces such that it is possible to compute upper and lower\nbounds on the values of the best coalition structures in them. These bounds are\nthen used to identify the sub-spaces that have no potential of containing the\noptimal solution so that they can be pruned. The algorithm, then, searches\nthrough the remaining sub-spaces very efficiently using a branch-and-bound\ntechnique to avoid examining all the solutions within the searched subspace(s).\nIn this setting, we prove that our algorithm enumerates all coalition\nstructures efficiently by avoiding redundant and invalid solutions\nautomatically. Moreover, in order to effectively test our algorithm we develop\na new type of input distribution which allows us to generate more reliable\nbenchmarks compared to the input distributions previously used in the field.\nGiven this new distribution, we show that for 27 agents our algorithm is able\nto find solutions that are optimal in 0.175% of the time required by the\nfastest available algorithm in the literature. The algorithm is anytime, and if\ninterrupted before it would have normally terminated, it can still provide a\nsolution that is guaranteed to be within a bound from the optimal one.\nMoreover, the guarantees we provide on the quality of the solution are\nsignificantly better than those provided by the previous state of the art\nalgorithms designed for this purpose. For example, for the worst case\ndistribution given 25 agents, our algorithm is able to find a 90% efficient\nsolution in around 10% of time it takes to find the optimal solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-16"}

A\nkey issue in addressing WSC as planning is that ontologies are not only formal\nvocabularies; they also axiomatize the possible relationships between concepts.\nSuch axioms correspond to what has been termed \"integrity constraints\" in the\nactions and change literature, and applying a web service is essentially a\nbelief update operation. The reasoning required for belief update is known to\nbe harder than reasoning in the ontology itself. The support for belief update\nis severely limited in current planning tools.\n  Our first contribution consists in identifying an interesting special case of\nWSC which is both significant and more tractable. The special case, which we\nterm \"forward effects\", is characterized by the fact that every ramification of\na web service application involves at least one new constant generated as\noutput by the web service. We show that, in this setting, the reasoning\nrequired for belief update simplifies to standard reasoning in the ontology\nitself. This relates to, and extends, current notions of \"message-based\" WSC,\nwhere the need for belief update is removed by a strong (often implicit or\ninformal) assumption of \"locality\" of the individual messages. We clarify the\ncomputational properties of the forward effects case, and point out a strong\nrelation to standard notions of planning under uncertainty, suggesting that\neffective tools for the latter can be successfully adapted to address the\nformer.\n  Furthermore, we identify a significant sub-case, named \"strictly forward\neffects\", where an actual compilation into planning under uncertainty exists.\nThis enables us to exploit off-the-shelf planning tools to solve message-based\nWSC in a general form that involves powerful ontologies, and requires reasoning\nabout partial matches between concepts.

We give examples to show how the new rule can\nbe applied in expert systems, in parametric statistical inference, and in\npattern classification, and discuss more generally the view of incompleteness\nprocesses defended here as well as some of its consequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-16"}

Until very recently, algorithms for\nstructure learning were based on maximum likelihood estimation, which has been\nproved to be NP-hard for Markov networks due to the difficulty of estimating\nthe parameters of the network, needed for the computation of the data\nlikelihood. The independence-based approach does not require the computation of\nthe likelihood, and thus both GSMN* and GSIMN can compute the structure\nefficiently (as shown in our experiments). GSMN* is an adaptation of the\nGrow-Shrink algorithm of Margaritis and Thrun for learning the structure of\nBayesian networks. GSIMN extends GSMN* by additionally exploiting Pearls\nwell-known properties of the conditional independence relation to infer novel\nindependences from known ones, thus avoiding the performance of statistical\ntests to estimate them.

A DCOP problem is a\nproblem where several agents coordinate their values such that the sum of the\nresulting constraint costs is minimal. It is often desirable to solve DCOP\nproblems with memory-bounded and asynchronous algorithms. We introduce\nBranch-and-Bound ADOPT (BnB-ADOPT), a memory-bounded asynchronous DCOP search\nalgorithm that uses the message-passing and communication framework of ADOPT\n(Modi, Shen, Tambe, and Yokoo, 2005), a well known memory-bounded asynchronous\nDCOP search algorithm, but changes the search strategy of ADOPT from best-first\nsearch to depth-first branch-and-bound search. Our experimental results show\nthat BnB-ADOPT finds cost-minimal solutions up to one order of magnitude faster\nthan ADOPT for a variety of large DCOP problems and is as fast as NCBB, a\nmemory-bounded synchronous DCOP search algorithm, for most of these DCOP\nproblems. Additionally, it is often desirable to find bounded-error solutions\nfor DCOP problems within a reasonable amount of time since finding cost-minimal\nsolutions is NP-hard. The existing bounded-error approximation mechanism allows\nusers only to specify an absolute error bound on the solution cost but a\nrelative error bound is often more intuitive. Thus, we present two new\nbounded-error approximation mechanisms that allow for relative error bounds and\nimplement them on top of BnB-ADOPT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-16"}

Finding plans with high utility\nappears to involve two linked problems: choosing a subset of soft goals to\nachieve and finding a low-cost plan to achieve them. New search algorithms and\nheuristics have been developed for planning with soft goals, and a new track\nhas been introduced in the International Planning Competition (IPC) to test\ntheir performance. In this note, we show however that these extensions are not\nneeded: soft goals do not increase the expressive power of the basic model of\nplanning with action costs, as they can easily be compiled away.

A\ndownside of NE is that it is not necessarily stable against deviations by\ncoalitions. Yet, as we show in this paper, in some cases, NE does exhibit\nstability against coalitional deviations, in that the benefits from a joint\ndeviation are bounded. In this sense, NE approximates strong equilibrium.\n  Coalition formation is a key issue in multiagent systems. We provide a\nframework for quantifying the stability and the performance of various\nassignment policies and solution concepts in the face of coalitional\ndeviations. Within this framework we evaluate a given configuration according\nto three measures: (i) IR_min: the maximal number alpha, such that there exists\na coalition in which the minimal improvement ratio among the coalition members\nis alpha, (ii) IR_max: the maximal number alpha, such that there exists a\ncoalition in which the maximal improvement ratio among the coalition members is\nalpha, and (iii) DR_max: the maximal possible damage ratio of an agent outside\nthe coalition.\n  We analyze these measures in job scheduling games on identical machines.

In\nthe WRN, multiple service providers (SPs) can cooperate to share their\nresources (e.g., relay nodes and spectrum), to achieve higher utility in terms\nof revenue. Such cooperation can improve the capacity of the WRN, and thus\nthroughput for terminal devices (TDs). However, this cooperation can be\nrealized only if fair allocation of aggregated utility, which is the sum of the\nutility of all the cooperative SPs, can be achieved. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the WRN consisting of SPs at the upper layer and TDs at the lower\nlayer and present a game theoretic framework to address the cooperation\ndecision making problem in the WRN. Specifically, the cooperation of SPs is\nmodeled as an overlapping coalition formation game, in which SPs should form a\nstable coalitional structure and obtain a fair share of the aggregated utility.\nWe also study the problem of allocating aggregated utility based on the concept\nof Shapley value, which stabilizes the cooperation of SPs in the WRN. The\ncooperation of TDs is modeled as a network formation game, in which TDs\nestablish links among each other to form a stable network structure. Numerical\nresults demonstrate that the proposed distributed algorithm obtains the\naggregated utility approximating the optimal solutions and achieves good\nconvergence speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 07:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

This method,\nhowever, suffers from an efficiency that depends on the orbital angular\nmomentum of the initial mode and on the presence of higher order radial modes.\nThe reason is that once the phase has been flattened, the field retains its\nringed intensity pattern and is therefore a nontrivial superposition of purely\nradial modes, of which only the fundamental one couples to a single mode\noptical fiber. In this paper, we study the efficiency of this technique both\ntheoretically and experimentally.

We discuss\nthe universal behaviors of systems in different regimes: from few particles,\ni.e. in dilute regime, to the trap thermodynamic limit.\n  The asymptotic trap-size (TS) dependence in the dilute regime (increasing the\ntrap size l keeping the particle number N fixed) is described by a universal TS\nscaling controlled by the dilute fixed point associated with the\nmetal-to-vacuum quantum transition. This scaling behavior is numerically\nchecked by DMRG simulations of the one-dimensional (1D) Hubbard model. In\nparticular, the particle density and its correlations show crossovers among\ndifferent regimes: for strongly repulsive interactions they approach those of a\nspinless Fermi gas, for weak interactions those of a free Fermi gas, and for\nstrongly attractive interactions they match those of a gas of hard-core bosonic\nmolecules.\n  The large-N behavior of systems at fixed N/l corresponds to a 1D trap\nthermodynamic limit. We address issues related to the accuracy of the local\ndensity approximation (LDA). We show that the particle density approaches its\nLDA in the large-l limit. When the trapped system is in the metallic phase,\ncorrections at finite l are O(l^{-1}) and oscillating around the center of the\ntrap.

Generally, pulsation on the Sgr dSph giant branches\nappears to be excited by the internal kappa mechanism. Pulsation amplitudes\nappear identical between red and asymptotic (RGB/AGB) giant stars, and between\nunreddened carbon and oxygen-rich stars at the same luminosity. The lack of\ncorrelation between infrared excess and variability among oxygen-rich stars\nindicates pulsations do not contribute significantly to wind driving in\noxygen-rich stars in the Sgr dSph, though the low amplitudes of these stars\nmean this may not apply elsewhere. The dust-enshrouded carbon stars have the\nhighest amplitudes of the stars we observe.

However the origin and physical properties of the\ncoronae, including geometry, kinematics and dynamics, yet remain poorly known.\nIn this work, taking [OIV] 25.89um emission line as an isotropic indicator of\nAGN's intrinsic luminosity, we compare the intrinsic corona X-ray emission\nbetween Seyfert 1 and Compton-thin Seyfert 2 galaxies, which are viewed at\ndifferent inclinations according to the unification scheme. We compile a sample\nof 130 Compton-thin Seyfert galaxies with both [OIV] 25.89um line luminosities\nmeasured with Spitzer-IRS and X-ray spectra observed by XMM-Newton, Chandra,\nSuzaku or Swift. Known radio-loud sources are excluded. We fit the X-ray\nspectra to obtain the absorption-corrected 2-10 keV continuum luminosities. We\nfind that Seyfert 1 galaxies are intrinsically brighter in intrinsic 2-10 keV\nemission by a factor of 2.8+0.5-0.4 (2.2+0.9-0.3 in Swift-BAT 14-195 keV\nemission), comparing with Compton-thin Seyfert 2 galaxies. The Seyfert 1 and\nCompton-thin Seyfert 2 galaxies follow a statistically identical correlation\nbetween the absorption-corrected 2-10 keV luminosity and the 14-195 keV\nluminosity, indicating that our absorption correction to the 2-10 keV flux is\nsufficient. The difference in X-ray emission between the two populations is\nthus unlikely due to X-ray absorption, and instead implies an intrinsic\nanisotropy in the corona X-ray emission. This striking anisotropy of X-ray\nemission can be explained by a bipolar outflowing corona with a bulk velocity\nof ~0.3-0.5c. This would provide a natural link between the so-called coronae\nand weak jets in these systems. Other consequences of outflowing coronae are\nalso discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 12:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

A\nuseful machine needing N=1000 or more, the number of continuous parameters\ndescribing the state of a quantum computer at any given moment is much greater\nthan the number of protons in the Universe. However, the theorists believe that\nthe feasibility of large-scale quantum computing has been proven via the\nthreshold theorem. Like for any theorem, the proof is based on a number of\nassumptions considered as axioms. However, in the physical world none of these\nassumptions can be fulfilled exactly. Any assumption can be only approached\nwith some limited precision. So, the rather meaningless\nerror-per-qubit-per-gate threshold must be supplemented by a list of the\nprecisions with which all assumptions behind the threshold theorem should hold.\nSuch a list still does not exist. The theory also seems to ignore the undesired\nfree evolution of the quantum computer caused by the energy differences of\nquantum states entering any given superposition. Another important point is\nthat the hypothetical quantum computer will be a system of at least a thousand\nof qubits plus an extremely complex and monstrously sophisticated classical\napparatus.

However, the subtle interplay of terms operating at the level of\nthe exact equation gets distorted by the approximations usually employed when\nevaluating the aforementioned kernel.

Without doubt, a measure of relatedness between text segments must take\ninto account both the lexical and the semantic relatedness between words. Such\na measure that captures well both aspects of text relatedness may help in many\ntasks, such as text retrieval, classification and clustering. In this paper we\npresent a new approach for measuring the semantic relatedness between words\nbased on their implicit semantic links. The approach exploits only a word\nthesaurus in order to devise implicit semantic links between words. Based on\nthis approach, we introduce Omiotis, a new measure of semantic relatedness\nbetween texts which capitalizes on the word-to-word semantic relatedness\nmeasure (SR) and extends it to measure the relatedness between texts. We\ngradually validate our method: we first evaluate the performance of the\nsemantic relatedness measure between individual words, covering word-to-word\nsimilarity and relatedness, synonym identification and word analogy; then, we\nproceed with evaluating the performance of our method in measuring text-to-text\nsemantic relatedness in two tasks, namely sentence-to-sentence similarity and\nparaphrase recognition. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method\noutperforms every lexicon-based method of semantic relatedness in the selected\ntasks and the used data sets, and competes well against corpus-based and hybrid\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-23"}

Optical spectra\nare measured of manganese doped beryl single crystal Mn:Be3Al2Si6O18, that\ncontains water molecules individually isolated in 0.51 nm diameter voids within\nthe crystal lattice. Two types of orientation are distinguished: water-I\nmolecules have their dipole moments aligned perpendicular to the c axis, and\ndipole moments of water-II molecules are parallel to the c-axis. The optical\nconductivity and permittivity spectra are recorded in terahertz and infrared\nranges, at frequencies from several wavenumbers up to 7000cm-1, at temperatures\nfrom 5K to 300K and for two polarizations, when the electric vector E of the\nradiation is parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis.
