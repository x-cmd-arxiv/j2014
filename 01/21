While this predicts an accumulation of genes, the gene number has\nremained remarkably constant through evolution. This paradox has not yet been\nresolved. Because orphan genes have been mainly analyzed over long evolutionary\ntime scales, orphan loss has remained unexplored. Here we study the patterns of\norphan turnover among close relatives in the Drosophila obscura group. We show\nthat orphans are not only emerging at a high rate, but that they are also\nrapidly lost. Interestingly, recently emerged orphans are more likely to be\nlost than older ones. Furthermore, highly expressed orphans with a strong\nmale-bias are more likely to be retained. Since both lost and retained orphans\nshow similar evolutionary signatures of functional conservation, we propose\nthat orphan loss is not driven by high rates of sequence evolution, but\nreflects lineage specific functional requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 16:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-23"}

This work investigates the cooling of a one\ndimensional atomic array to the ground state of motion via the interaction with\nthe single mode field of a high-finesse cavity. The key factor ensuring the\ncooling is found to be the mechanical inhomogeneity of the traps. Furthermore\nit is shown that the pumped cavity mode does not only mediate the cooling but\nalso provides the necessary inhomogeneity if its periodicity differs from the\none of the array. This configuration results in the ground state cooling of\nseveral tens of atoms within a few milliseconds, a timescale compatible with\ncurrent experimental conditions. Moreover, the cooling rate scaling with the\natom number reveals a drastic change of the dynamics with the size of the\narray: atoms are either cooled independently, or via collective modes.

The\nelectromagnetic model is based on a layer recursive computation of\naxial-symmetric fields in connection with a magnetic frill generator excitation\nthat can be calibrated to the current measured at the input of the cable. The\nlayer recursive formulation enables a stable and efficient numerical\ncomputation of the related dispersion functions as well as a detailed analysis\nregarding the analytic and asymptotic properties of the associated\ndeterminants.

The\nclustering of low-mass stars around the massive W-R binary gamma^2 Velorum was\none of the first GES targets. Aims: To empirically determine the radial\nvelocity (RV) precision of GES data, construct a kinematically unbiased sample\nof cluster members and characterise their dynamical state. Methods: Targets\nwere selected from colour-magnitude diagrams and intermediate resolution\nspectroscopy used to derive RVs and assess membership from the strength of the\nLi6708A line. The RV distribution was analysed using a maximum likelihood\ntechnique that accounts for unresolved binaries. Results: The GES RV precision\nis about 0.25km/s and sufficient to resolve velocity structure in the low-mass\npopulation around gamma^2 Vel. The structure is well fitted by two kinematic\ncomponents with roughly equal numbers of stars; the first has an intrinsic\ndispersion of 0.34+/-0.16km/s, consistent with virial equilibrium. The second\nhas a broader dispersion of 1.60+/-0.37km/s and is offset from the first by\n~2km/s. The first population is older by 1-2Myr based on a greater level of Li\ndepletion seen among its M-stars and is probably more centrally concentrated\naround gamma^2 Vel. Conclusions: We consider several formation scenarios,\nconcluding that the two kinematic components are a bound remnant of the\noriginal, denser cluster that formed gamma^2 Vel, and a dispersed population\nfrom the wider Vela OB2 association, of which gamma^2 Vel is the most massive\nmember. The apparent youth of gamma^2 Vel compared to the older (>=10Myr)\nlow-mass population surrounding it suggests a scenario where the massive binary\nformed in a clustered environment after the formation of the bulk of the\nlow-mass stars.[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 16:44:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

This strategy can be understood (especially for cases of sparse\narrays) as fitting models to models, since the deconvolved images are already\nnon-unique model representations of the actual data (i.e., the visibilities).\nIndeed, the interferometric images may be affected by visibility gridding,\nweighting schemes (e.g., natural vs. uniform), and the particulars of the\n(non-linear) deconvolution algorithms. Fitting models to the direct\ninterferometric observables (i.e., the visibilities) is preferable in the cases\nof simple (analytical) sky intensity distributions. In this paper, we present\nUVMULTIFIT, a versatile library for fitting visibility data, implemented in a\nPython-based framework.

In general, non-chordal graphs have intractable normalizing constants\nwhich renders the calculation of Bayesian and other scores difficult beyond\nvery small-scale systems. Recently, there has been a surge of interest towards\nthe use of regularized pseudo-likelihood methods for structural learning of\nlarge-scale Markov network models, as such an approach avoids the assumption of\nchordality. The currently available methods typically necessitate the use of a\ntuning parameter to adapt the level of regularization for a particular dataset,\nwhich can be optimized for example by cross-validation.

Then, the Boltzmann equation is solved by means of\nthe Chapman-Enskog expansion around the local version of the distribution $f_0$\nto obtain the relevant transport coefficients of the system: the shear\nviscosity $\\eta$, the thermal conductivity $\\kappa$, and a new transport\ncoefficient $\\mu$ (which is also present in granular gases) relating the heat\nflux with the density gradient. The results indicate that while $\\eta$ is not\naffected by the drag force, the impact of this force on the transport\ncoefficients $\\kappa$ and $\\mu$ may be significant. Finally, a stability\nanalysis of the linear hydrodynamic equations with respect to the\ntime-dependent equilibrium state is performed, showing that the onset of\ninstability is associated with the transversal shear mode that could be\nunstable for wave numbers smaller than a certain critical wave number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 17:26:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 15:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We study the distribution of the measured merger fractions,\nthat follow a log-normal function, and estimate the cosmic variance sigma_v as\nthe intrinsic dispersion of the observed distribution. We develop a maximum\nlikelihood estimator to measure a reliable sigma_v and avoid the dispersion due\nto the observational errors (including the Poisson shot noise term). The cosmic\nvariance of the merger fraction depends mainly on (i) the number density of the\npopulations under study, both for the principal (n_1) and the companion (n_2)\ngalaxy in the close pair, and (ii) the probed cosmic volume V_c.

One\nof the defining characteristics of intelligent behavior is the capacity to\nlearn from experience.

Owing to, e.g., a large space of possible strategies, learning is\ntypically slow. Even for a moderate task environment, it may simply take too\nlong to rationally respond to a given situation. If the environment is\nimpatient, allowing only a certain time for a response, an agent may then be\nunable to cope with the situation and to learn at all.

Eta Car's ultra-violet, optical, and X-ray light curves and its\nspectrum suggest a physical change in its stellar wind over the last decade. It\nwas proposed that the mass-loss rate decreased by a factor of about 2 in the\nlast 15 years. We complement these recent results by investigating the past\nevolution and the current state of eta Car in the near-infrared (IR). Methods.\nWe present JHKL photometry of eta Car obtained at SAAO Sutherland from\n2004-2013 with the Mk II photometer at the 0.75-m telescope and JHKs photometry\nwith SIRIUS at the 1.4-m IRSF telescope from 2012-2013. The near-IR light\ncurves since 1972 are analyzed. Results. The long-term brightening trends in\neta Car's JHKL light curves were discontinuous around the 1998 periastron\npassage. After 1998, the star shows excess emission above the extrapolated\ntrend from earlier dates, foremost in J and H, and the blueward, cyclical\nprogression in its near-IR colors is accelerated. The near-IR color evolution\nis strongly correlated with the periastron passages. After correcting for the\nsecular trend we find that the color evolution matches an apparent increase in\nblackbody temperature of an optically thick near-IR emitting plasma component\nfrom about 3500 to 6000 K over the last 20 years. Conclusions. We suggest that\nthe changing near-IR emission may be caused by variability in optically thick\nbremsstrahlung emission. Periastron passages play a key role in the observed\nexcess near-IR emission after 1998 and the long-term color evolution. We thus\npropose as a hypothesis that angular momentum transfer (via tidal acceleration)\nduring periastron passages leads to sudden changes in eta Car's atmosphere\nresulting in a long-term decrease in the mass-loss rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 17:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The tight-binding model is used to analyze the effect\nof SOC in the band structure, considering separately the contributions from the\ntransition metal and the chalcogen atoms. Finally, we present a scenario where,\nin the case of strong SOC, the spin/orbital/valley entanglement at the minimum\nof the conduction band at Q can be probed and be of experimental interest in\nthe most common cases of electron-doping reported for this family of compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 18:42:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 17:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

The phase transition is investigated using two scenarios of the\nfirst-order phase transition and smooth crossover phase transition. For\nfirst-order scenario, which is used for intermediate temperature regime, the\nevolution of the physical quantities, such as temperature and scale factor, are\ninvestigated before, during and after the phase transition. The results show\nthat the transition occurs in about micro-second. In the next part, the\nphenomenon is studied by assuming a smooth crossover transition where the\nlattice QCD data is utilized to obtain a realistic equation of state for the\nmatter. The investigation for this part is performed in two regimes of high and\nlow-temperature. Using trace anomaly in the high-temperature regime specifies a\nsimple equation of state which states that the quark-gluon behaves like\nradiation. However, in the low-temperature regime, the trace anomaly is\naffected by discretization effects, and the hadron resonance gas model is\nutilized instead. Using this model, a more realistic equation of state could be\nfound in the low-temperature regime. The crossover phase transition in both\nregimes is considered. The results determine that the transition occurs at the\ntime around a few micro-second. Also, it is realized that the transition in the\nlow-temperature regime occurs after the transition in the high-temperature\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2014 19:44:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 May 2014 05:26:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 09:40:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 24 Aug 2014 12:48:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 29 Dec 2019 09:25:32 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 11:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

In the current work, we\ntheoretically study the relevance of Migdal's theorem in graphene and Weyl\nsemimetals which are examples of 2D and 3D Dirac materials, respectively, with\nlinear and chiral band dispersion. Our work also applies to 2D and 3D\ntopological insulator systems. In Fermi liquids, the renormalization of the\nelectron-phonon vertex scales as the ratio of sound ($v_s$) to Fermi ($v_F$)\nvelocity, which is typically a small quantity. In two- and three-dimensional\nquasirelativistic systems, such as undoped graphene and Weyl semimetals, the\none loop electron-phonon vertex renormalization, which also scales as\n$\\eta=v_s/v_F$ as $\\eta \\rightarrow 0$, is, however, enhanced by an ultraviolet\n\\emph{logarithmic divergent correction}, arising from the linear, chiral Dirac\nband dispersion. Such enhancement of the electron-phonon vertex can be\nsignificantly softened due to the logarithmic increment of the Fermi velocity,\narising from the long range Coulomb interaction, and therefore, the\nelectron-phonon vertex correction does not have a logarithmic divergence at low\nenergy. Otherwise, the Coulomb interaction does not lead to any additional\nrenormalization of the electron-phonon vertex. Therefore, electron-phonon\nvertex corrections in two- and three-dimensional Dirac fermionic systems scale\nas $v_s/v^0_F$, where $v^0_F$ is the bare Fermi velocity, and small when $v_s\n\\ll v^0_F$.

The recently discovered Galactic halo star\nSDSS J102915+172927 has a stellar mass of 0.8 Msun and a metallicity of\nZ=4.5x10^-5 Zsun and represents an optimal candidate for the dust-induced\nlow-mass star formation.

We find that the presence of\nrealistic uncertainties reduces the measured value of eta by up to a factor of\n3, leading to the inference of shallower decays than the true value.

It is the propagation of this wave through the cloud interior that\ntriggers the subsequent collapse.

In all cases, we find that the\nclassic \"outside-in\" collapse mode for super-critical BE spheres is recovered\nbefore a protostar (i.e. sink particle) forms.

We use\nhydrodynamical simulations to study the efficiency of multiple SNe in heating\nthe interstellar medium (ISM) and filling the volume with gas of high\ntemperatures. We argue that it is important for SNe remnants to have a large\nfilling factor {\\it and} a large heating efficiency. For this, they have to be\nclustered in space and time, and keep exploding until the hot gas percolates\nthrough the whole region, in order to compensate for the radiative loss. In the\ncase of a limited number of SNe, we find that although the filling factor can\nbe large, the heating efficiency declines after reaching a large value. In the\ncase of a continuous series of SNe, the hot gas ($T \\ge 3 \\times 10^6$ K) can\npercolate through the whole region after the total volume filling factor\nreaches a threshold of $\\sim 0.3$.

Essential ingredients for MCSR include the 3D\ninteractions, the confinement potential and a spin-flipping field. Near MCSR a\nmany-body spinor system exhibits exotic spin density distributions and pair\ncorrelations, which are significantly different from those near a\nsingle-channel resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 00:35:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Aug 2014 08:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-02"}

The\nADI scheme is a powerful finite difference method for solving parabolic\nequations, due to its unconditional stability and high efficiency. However, it\nsuffers from a serious accuracy reduction in space for interface problems with\ndifferent materials and nonsmooth solutions. If the jumps in a function and its\nderivatives are known across the interface, rigorous ADI schemes have been\nsuccessfully constructed in the literature based on the immersed interface\nmethod (IIM) so that the spatial accuracy can be restored. Nevertheless, the\ndevelopment of accurate and stable ADI methods for general parabolic interface\nproblems with physical interface conditions that describe jumps of a function\nand its flux, remains unsolved. To overcome this difficulty, a novel tensor\nproduct decomposition is proposed in this paper to decouple 2D jump conditions\ninto essentially one-dimensional (1D) ones.

Fast algebraic solvers for perturbed\ntridiagonal systems are developed to maintain the computational efficiency.\nStability analysis is conducted through eigenvalue spectrum analysis, which\nnumerically demonstrates the unconditional stability of the proposed ADI\nmethod.

However, noncommutative phase spaces realized with noncentral abelian\nextensions of the kinematical groups are algebraically more general than those\nconstructed on their central extensions. As the coadjoint orbit construction\nhas not been carried through some of these planar kinematical groups before,\nphysical interpretations of new generators of those extended structures are\ngiven. Furthermore, in all the cases discussed here, the noncommutativity is\nmeasured by naturally introduced fields, each corresponding to a minimal\ncoupling.

We consider a sample of 24 nearby galaxies in\nwhich the presence of a BLR has been reported from their Palomar ground-based\nspectra. Following a widely used strategy, we used the [SII] doublet to\nsubtract the contribution of the narrow emission lines to the H-alpha+[NII]\ncomplex and to isolate the BLR emission. Significant residuals that suggest a\nBLR, are present. However, the results change substantially when the [OI]\ndoublet is used. Furthermore, the spectra are also reproduced well by just\nincluding a wing in the narrow H-alpha and [NII] lines, thus not requiring the\npresence of a BLR. We conclude that complex structure of the narrow line region\n(NLR) is not captured with this approach and that it does not lead to general\nrobust constraints on the properties of the BLR in these low luminosity AGN.\nNonetheless, the existence of a BLR is firmly established in 5 Seyferts, and 5\nLINERs. However, the measured BLR fluxes and widths in the 5 LINERs differ\nsubstantially with respect to the ground-based data.

We ascribe the larger BLR radius to\nthe lower accretion rate in LINERs when compared to the Seyfert, which causes\nthe formation of an inner region dominated by an advection-dominated accretion\nflow (ADAF). The estimated BLR sizes in LINERs are comparable to the radius\nwhere the transition between the ADAF and the standard thin disk occurs due to\ndisk evaporation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 09:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In\naddition, our results show that the scaling laws are robust in the presence of\nstrong finite-size effects, hinting at a subtle bulk-boundary decoupling\nmechanism which enforces the macroscopic laws on the bulk of the finite-sized\nfluid. This allows to measure for the first time the marginal anomaly of the\nheat conductivity predicted for hard disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 09:56:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 09:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-26"}

The jet shape is\nderived from the energy collimation within the same approximations and we also\ncompare our calculations for the energy collimation with the event generators\nPythia 6 and YaJEM for the first time in this paper. The modification of jets\nby the medium in both cases is implemented by altering the infrared sector\nusing the Borghini-Wiedemann model. The energy collimation and jet shapes\nqualitatively describe a clear broadening of showers in the medium, which is\nfurther supported by YaJEM in the final comparison of the jet shape with CMS\nPbPb data at center-of-mass energy 2.76 TeV.

They are low-mass objects, and\ntherefore their rotation speed is very low. Several galaxies are observed to\nshow quite strong magnetic fields. These cases of strong ordered magnetic\nfields seem to correlate with a high, but not extremely high, star formation\nrate. We investigate whether these magnetic fields could be generated by the\ncosmic-ray-driven dynamo. The environment of a dwarf galaxy is unfavourable for\nthe large-scale dynamo action because of the very slow rotation that is\nrequired to create the regular component of the magnetic field. We built a 3D\nglobal model of a dwarf galaxy that consists of two gravitational components:\nthe stars and the dark-matter halo described by the purely phenomenological\nprofile proposed previously. We solved a system of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nequations that include an additional cosmic-ray component described by the\nfluid approximation. We found that the cosmic-ray-driven dynamo can amplify the\nmagnetic field with an exponential growth rate. The $e$-folding time is\ncorrelated with the initial rotation speed. The final mean value of the\nazimuthal flux for our models is of the order of few $\\mu$G and the system\nreaches its equipartition level. The results indicate that the\ncosmic-ray-driven dynamo is a process that can explain the magnetic fields in\ndwarf galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 12:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

To resolve the difficulty caused by the dependence of the\nEuclidean distance spectrum on the way of signal mapping, we propose to use\nrandom mapping, resulting in an ensemble of RS-coded modulation (RS-CM)\nsystems. For this ensemble of RS-CM systems, analytic bounds are derived, which\ncan be evaluated from the known (symbol-level) Hamming distance spectrum. Also\npresented in this paper are simulation-based bounds, which are applicable to\nany specific RS-CM system and can be evaluated by the aid of a list decoding\n(in the Euclidean space) algorithm. The simulation-based bounds do not need\ndistance spectrum and are numerically tight for short RS codes in the regime\nwhere the word error rate (WER) is not too low. Numerical comparison results\nare relevant in at least three aspects. First, in the short code length regime,\nRS-CM using BPSK modulation with random mapping has a better performance than\nbinary random linear codes. Second, RS-CM with random mapping (time varying)\ncan have a better performance than with specific mapping. Third, numerical\nresults show that the recently proposed Chase-type decoding algorithm is\nessentially the ML decoding algorithm for short RS codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 13:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-22"}

In the second part we analyse the associated implications for the\nhabitability of planets close to the outer edge of the habitable zone (HZ).\nThis part of the paper focuses in particular on the multistability property of\nclimate, i.e. the parallel existence of both an ice-free and an ice-covered\nclimate state.

The resulting\nequation is decomposed into two coupled cranking-type equations, one for the\noscillation and another for the intrinsic motion, using a product wavefunction\nand a constrained variational method. The energy and cranking parameters in the\ncoupled equations are self-consistently determined as functions of the system\nparameters by the solutions of the equations themselves. This self-consistency\nmakes the two equations time-reversal invariant, unlike the conventional\nphenomenological cranking models. The self-consistency and time-reversal\ninvariance accept only real solutions to the equations. For the harmonic\noscillator mean-field potential, we explicitly determine these solutions and\nthe corresponding eigenvalues, and derive the set of equations that determine\nself-consistently the parameters. To explore the relative importance of the\nvarious model features and approximations, we perform a preliminary scoping\ncalculation of the excitation energy of the first excited states in the light\nnuclei using a sum rule to determine the oscillation frequency. The preliminary\nresults indicate that, except in the lightest nuclei, the excitation energies\nare significantly overpredicted in the light nuclei due to the neglect, among\nother factors, of the deformation degree of freedom.

An important\npoint with respect to applications is the stability of exact solutions like\nsolitons. Whereas the linear or spectral stability can be addressed\nanalytically in some situations, the proof of full nonlinear (in-)stability\nremains mostly an open question. In this paper, we numerically investi- gate\nthe transverse (in-)stability of the solitonic solution to the one-dimensional\ncubic NLS equation, the well known isolated soliton, under the time evolution\nof several higher dimensional models, being admissible as a tranverse\nperturbation of the 1d cubic NLS. One of the recent work in this context [42]\nallowed to prove the instability of the soliton, under the flow of the\nclassical (elliptic) 2d cubic NLS equation, for both localized or periodic\nperturbations. The characteristics of this instability stay however unknown. Is\nthere a blow-up, dispersion..? We first illustrate how this instability occurs\nfor the elliptic 2d cubic NLS equation and then show that the elliptic-elliptic\nDavey Stewartson system (a (2+1)-dimensional generalization of the cubic NLS\nequation) behaves as the former in this context. Then we investigate hyperbolic\nvariants of the above models, for which no theory in this context is available.\nNamely we consider the hyperbolic 2d cubic NLS equation and the\nDavey-Stewartson II equations.

Recent machines for semiconductor process\nare required for high level of automation which are composed of motion control,\nmachine vision, data acquisition and networking. These functions are executed\nthrough industrial equipments that are generally installed in a computer. The\nequipments occupy a great part of system resource and generate a lot of\ncomputation, so the software structure should be designed for efficiency. The\nproposed architecture is consisted of four layers and virtual equipments(VEs).\nThe VEs are made by subclassing the physical equipments(PEs) and the layers are\ncoded into thread which updates the status of VEs. Subroutines in a program\nrefer to the pointer of VEs, and direct access to physical equipment are\nprohibited. The number of access (NOA) to PEs in typical industrial application\nwas simulated for the unlimited access structure and the presented structure.\nThe result showed that the proposed structure was more efficient than typical\nones and irrespective of subroutines. This architecture was also applied to\ndesign a machine operating software and performed automatic wafer dicing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 07:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-24"}

The\nauthor's stated philosophical objections to the Einstein equation can be dealt\nwith in a markedly different way -- a new paper entitled \"Unique Einstein\nGravity from Feynman's Lorentz Condition\" has been submitted. Einstein's\nequivalence principle implies that the acceleration of a particle in a\n\"specified\" gravitational field is independent of its mass. While this is\ncertainly true to great accuracy for bodies we observe in the Earth's\ngravitational field, a hypothetical body of mass comparable to the Earth's\nwould perceptibly cause the Earth to fall toward it, which would feed back into\nthe strength as a function of time of the Earth's gravitational field affecting\nthat body. In short, Einstein's equivalence principle isn't exact, but is an\napproximation that ignores recoil of the \"specified\" gravitational field, which\nsheds light on why general relativity has no clearly delineated native\nembodiment of conserved four-momentum. Einstein's 1905 relativity of course\ndoesn't have the inexactitudes he unwittingly built into GR, so it is natural\nto explore a Lorentz-covariant gravitational theory patterned directly on\nelectromagnetism, wherein a system's zero-divergence overall stress-energy,\nincluding all gravitational feedback contributions, is the source of its\ngravitational tensor potential. Remarkably, that alone completely determines\nLorentz-covariant gravity's interaction with any conservative system of locally\ninteracting classical fields; no additional \"principles\" of any kind are\nrequired. The highly intricate equation for the gravitational interaction\ncontribution to such a system's Lagrangian density is only amenable to solution\nby successively refined approximation, however.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2014 14:29:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 05:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-28"}
