In addition to the well known\nrenormalization of the g factor and the finite spin decoherence and relaxation\ntimes, Kondo exchange has recently been found to give rise to a newly\ndiscovered effect: the renormalization of the single ion magnetic anisotropy.\nHere we put these apparently different phenomena on equal footing by treating\nthe effect of Kondo exchange perturbatively. In this formalism, the central\nquantity is $\\rho J$, the product of the density of states at the Fermi energy\n$\\rho$ and the Kondo exchange constant J.

In our numerical implementation we fully optimize the orbitals and\nthe correlation function on a spatial grid without restrictions on their\nfunctional form. Due to this particular form of the wave function, we can prove\nthat none of the amplitudes vanishes and moreover that it displays a distinct\nsign pattern and a series of avoided crossings as a function of the bond\ndistance in agreement with the exact solution. This shows that the wave\nfunction Ansatz correctly incorporates the long range Van der Waals\ninteractions.

We then show that conformal invariance\nimplies that matter particles are not coupled to the dilaton in the late\nUniverse at the classical level.

Whereas reciprocity or\nconditional cooperation is one of the most prominent mechanisms proposed to\nexplain the emergence of cooperation in social dilemmas, recent experimental\nfindings on networked Prisoner's Dilemma games suggest that conditional\ncooperation also depends on the previous action of the player---namely on the\n`mood' in which the player currently is. Roughly, a majority of people behaves\nas conditional cooperators if they cooperated in the past, while they ignore\nthe context and free-ride with high probability if they did not. However, the\nultimate origin of this behavior represents a conundrum itself. Here we aim\nspecifically at providing an evolutionary explanation of moody conditional\ncooperation. To this end, we perform an extensive analysis of different\nevolutionary dynamics for players' behavioral traits---ranging from standard\nprocesses used in game theory based on payoff comparison to others that include\nnon-economic or social factors. Our results show that only a dynamic built upon\nreinforcement learning is able to give rise to evolutionarily stable moody\nconditional cooperation, and at the end to reproduce the human behaviors\nobserved in the experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 18:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

In these problems, objects must be assigned to handlers, but each\nobject has a probability of destroying itself and all the other objects\nallocated to the same handler. The goal is to maximize the expected value of\nthe objects handled successfully.\n  We show that finding the optimal allocation is\n$\\mathsf{NP}$-$\\mathsf{complete}$, even if all the handlers are identical. We\npresent an FPTAS when the number of handlers is constant.

The\nproblem involves a collection of agents (radios) that wish to discover each\nother in the blind setting where there is no shared infrastructure and they\ninitially have no knowledge of each other. Time is divided into discrete slots;\nspectrum is divided into discrete channels, $\\{1,2,..., n\\}$. Each agent may\naccess a single channel in a single time slot and we say that two agents\nrendezvous when they access the same channel in the same time slot. The model\nis asymmetric: each agent $A_i$ may only use a particular subset $S_i$ of the\nchannels and different agents may have access to different subsets of channels.\nThe goal is to design deterministic channel hopping schedules for each agent so\nas to guarantee rendezvous between any pair of agents with overlapping channel\nsets.\n  Two independent sets of authors, Shin et al. and Lin et al., gave the first\nconstructions guaranteeing asynchronous blind rendezvous in $O(n^2)$ and\n$O(n^3)$ time, respectively. We present a substantially improved construction\nguaranteeing that any two agents, $A_i$, $A_j$, will rendezvous in $O(|S_i|\n|S_j| \\log\\log n)$ time. Our results are the first that achieve nontrivial\ndependence on $|S_i|$, the size of the set of available channels.

We also\nachieve the best possible bound of $O(1)$ time for the symmetric situation;\nprevious works could do no better than $O(n)$. Using the probabilistic method\nand Ramsey theory we provide evidence in support of our suspicion that our\nconstruction is asymptotically optimal for small size channel subsets: we show\nboth a $c |S_i||S_j|$ lower bound and a $c \\log\\log n$ lower bound when $|S_i|,\n|S_j| \\leq n/2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 20:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-29"}

For this purpose, we combined stellar evolution models using the\nGeneva code and atmospheric models using CMFGEN. With our approach, we were\nable to produce observables, such as a synthetic high-resolution spectrum and\nphotometry, aiding the comparison between evolution models and observed data.\nHere we analyze the evolution of a non-rotating 60 Msun star and its spectrum\nthroughout its lifetime. Interestingly, the star has a supergiant appearance\n(luminosity class I) even at the ZAMS. We find the following evolutionary\nsequence of spectral types: O3 I (at the ZAMS), O4 I (middle of the H-core\nburning phase), B supergiant (BSG), B hypergiant (BHG), hot luminous blue\nvariable (LBV; end of H-core burning), cool LBV (H-shell burning through the\nbeginning of the He-core burning phase), rapid evolution through late WN and\nearly WN, early WC (middle of He-core burning), and WO (end of He-core burning\nuntil core collapse). We find the following spectroscopic phase lifetimes:\n3.22e6 yr for the O-type, 0.34e5 yr (BSG), 0.79e5 yr (BHG), 2.35e5 yr (LBV),\n1.05e5 yr (WN), 2.57e4 yr (WC), and 3.80e4 yr (WO). Compared to previous\nstudies, we find a much longer (shorter) duration for the early WN (late WN)\nphase, as well as a long-lived LBV phase. We show that LBVs arise naturally in\nsingle-star evolution models at the end of the MS when the mass-loss rate\nincreases as a consequence of crossing the bistability limit. We discuss the\nevolution of the spectra, magnitudes, colors, and ionizing flux across the\nstar's lifetime, and the way they are related to the evolution of the interior.\n[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 20:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

On the scale of our survey, the metallicity of NGC\n4833 is [Fe/H]=-2.015+/-0.004+/-0.084 dex (rms=0.014 dex) from 12 stars\nobserved with UVES, where the first error is from statistics and the second one\nrefers to the systematic effects. The iron abundance in NGC 4833 is homogeneous\nat better than 6%. On the other hand, the light elements involved in\nproton-capture reactions at high temperature show the large star-to-star\nvariations observed in almost all GCs studied so far. The Na-O anticorrelation\nin NGC 4833 is quite extended, as expected from the high temperatures reached\nby stars on the HB, and NGC 4833 contains a conspicuous fraction of stars with\nextreme [O/Na] ratios. More striking is the finding that large star-to-star\nvariations are seen also for Mg, which spans a range of more than 0.5 dex in\nthis GC. Depletions in Mg are correlated to the abundances of O and\nanti-correlated with Na, Al, and Si abundances. This pattern suggests the\naction of nuclear processing at unusually high temperatures, producing the\nextreme chemistry observed in the stellar generations of NGC 4833. This extreme\nchanges are also seen in giants of the much more massive GCs M 54 and omega\nCen, and our conclusion is that NGC 4833 has probably lost a conpicuous\nfraction of its original mass due to bulge shocking, as also indicated by its\norbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In order to distil the\ntopological entropy, one resorts to extrapolation as a function of system size,\nor to clever subtraction schemes that allow to cancel out the leading terms.\nBoth approaches have the disadvantage of requiring multiple (accurate)\ncalculations of the entanglement of the system. Here we propose a modification\nof conventional entanglement calculations that allows to obtain the topological\nentropy of a system from a single measurement of entanglement. In our approach,\nwe replace the conventional trace over the degrees of freedom of a partition of\nthe system with a projection onto a given state (which needs not be known). We\nshow that a proper choice of partition and projective measurement allows to rid\nthe entanglement measures of the typical boundary terms, thus exposing the\ntopological contribution alone. We consider specifically the measures known as\nvon Neumann entropy and entanglement negativity, and we discuss their\napplication to both models that exhibit quantum as well as classical\ntopological order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 22:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-07"}

A theorem of G.Wilson and the first\nauthor asserts that G acts transitively the Calogero-Moser spaces C_n for all\nn. We generalize this theorem in two ways: first, we prove that the action of G\non C_n is doubly transitive, meaning that G acts transitively on the\nconfiguration space of (ordered) pairs of points in C_n; second, we prove that\nthe diagonal action of G on the product of (any number of) copies of C_n is\ntransitive provided the corresponding n's are pairwise distinct. In the second\npart of the paper, we study the isotropy subgroups G_n of G in C_n. We equip\neach G_n with the structure of an ind-algebraic group and classify the Borel\nsubgroups of these ind-algebraic groups for all n. Our classification shows\nthat every Borel subgroup of G (= G_0) is conjugate to the subgroup B of\ntriangular (elementary) automorphisms; on the other hand, for n > 0, the\nconjugacy classes of Borel subgroups of G_n are parametrized by certain orbits\nof B in C_n. Our main result is that the conjugacy classes of non-abelian Borel\nsubgroups of G_n correspond precisely to the B-orbits of the C^*-fixed points\nin C_n and thus, are in bijection with the partitions of n. We also prove an\ninfinite-dimensional analogue of the classical theorem of R.Steinberg,\ncharacterizing the (non-abelian) Borel subgroups of G_n in purely\ngroup-theoretic terms. Together with our classification this last theorem\nimplies that the G_n are pairwise non-isomorphic as abstract groups. Our study\nof the groups G_n is motivated by the fact that these are the automorphism\ngroups of non-isomorphic simple algebras Morita equivalent to the Weyl algebra\nA_1(C). From this perspective, our results generalize well-known theorems of\nJ.Dixmier and L.Makar-Limanov about the automorphism group of A_1(C).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 22:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-30"}

The\noriginal idea considered a single pair of electrodes to read out the current\nand distinguish the bases [1, 2]. Here, we propose an improvement to the\noriginal sequencing by tunneling method, in which $N$ pairs of electrodes are\nbuilt in series along a synthetic nanochannel.

All the metric\nspinors and connecting objects that arise here are formally the same as the\nones borne by the traditional formalisms. Any spin-affine connexion appears to\npossess a torsional part which is conveniently chosen as a suitable asymmetric\ncontribution. Such a torsional affine contribution thus supplies a\ngauge-invariant potential that can eventually be taken to carry an observable\ncharacter, and thereby effectively takes over the role of any trivially\nrealizable symmetric contribution. The overall curvature spinors for any\nspin-affine connexion accordingly emerge from the irreducible decomposition of\na mixed world-spin object which in turn comes out of the action on elementary\nspinors of a typical torsionful second-order covariant derivative operator.\nExplicit curvature expansions are likewise exhibited which fill in the gap\nrelated to their absence from the literature.

The CO emission, dust opacity at 353 GHz (tau353), and dust\ntemperature (Td) show generally good spatial correspondence.

The integrated HI intensity WHI and tau353 show a large\nscatter with a correlation coefficient of ~0.6 for a Td range from 16 K to 22\nK.

To realize\nsufficient link margin, mmWave systems will employ directional beamforming with\nlarge antenna arrays at both the transmitter and receiver. Due to the high cost\nand power consumption of gigasample mixed-signal devices, mmWave precoding will\nlikely be divided among the analog and digital domains. The large number of\nantennas and the presence of analog beamforming requires the development of\nmmWave-specific channel estimation and precoding algorithms. This paper\ndevelops an adaptive algorithm to estimate the mmWave channel parameters that\nexploits the poor scattering nature of the channel. To enable the efficient\noperation of this algorithm, a novel hierarchical multi-resolution codebook is\ndesigned to construct training beamforming vectors with different beamwidths.\nFor single-path channels, an upper bound on the estimation error probability\nusing the proposed algorithm is derived, and some insights into the efficient\nallocation of the training power among the adaptive stages of the algorithm are\nobtained. The adaptive channel estimation algorithm is then extended to the\nmulti-path case relying on the sparse nature of the channel. Using the\nestimated channel, this paper proposes a new hybrid analog/digital precoding\nalgorithm that overcomes the hardware constraints on the analog-only\nbeamforming, and approaches the performance of digital solutions. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed low-complexity channel estimation algorithm\nachieves comparable precoding gains compared to exhaustive channel training\nalgorithms.

Short-read alignment and assembly are among the most well-studied\nproblems. Many state-of-the-art aligners, at their core, have used the\nBurrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) as a main-memory index of a reference genome\n(typical example, NCBI human genome). Recently, BWT has also found its use in\nstring-graph assembly, for indexing the reads (i.e., raw data from DNA\nsequencers). In a typical data set, the volume of reads is tens of times of the\nsequenced genome and can be up to 100 Gigabases. Note that a reference genome\nis relatively stable and computing the index is not a frequent task. For reads,\nthe index has to computed from scratch for each given input. The ability of\nefficient BWT construction becomes a much bigger concern than before. In this\npaper, we present a practical method called CX1 for constructing the BWT of\nvery large string collections. CX1 is the first tool that can take advantage of\nthe parallelism given by a graphics processing unit (GPU, a relative cheap\ndevice providing a thousand or more primitive cores), as well as simultaneously\nthe parallelism from a multi-core CPU and more interestingly, from a cluster of\nGPU-enabled nodes. Using CX1, the BWT of a short-read collection of up to 100\nGigabases can be constructed in less than 2 hours using a machine equipped with\na quad-core CPU and a GPU, or in about 43 minutes using a cluster with 4 such\nmachines (the speedup is almost linear after excluding the first 16 minutes for\nloading the reads from the hard disk).

Here we investigated the\nfollowing human boundaries: development of performances with time in Olympic\nand non-Olympic events, development of sport performances with aging among\nhumans and others species (greyhounds, thoroughbreds, mice). Development of\nperformances from a broader point of view (demography & lifespan) in a specific\nsub-system centered on primary energy was also investigated. We show that the\nphysiological developments are limited with time. Three major and direct\ndeterminants of sport performance are age, technology and climatic conditions\n(temperature).

This\nlast parameter is a major indirect propeller of performance development. We\nshow that when physiological and societal performance indicators such as\nlifespan and population density depend on primary energies, the energy source,\ncompetition and mobility are key parameters for achieving long term sustainable\ntrajectories. Otherwise, the vast majority (98.7%) of the studied trajectories\nreaches 0 before 15 generations, due to the consumption of fossil energy and a\nlow mobility rate.

Our light curves, displaying a flat bottom\nat secondary minimum and an O'Connell effect, were simultaneously analyzed with\nthe radial-velocity (RV) curves given by Rucinski et al. (2008). The light\nchanges of the system are best modeled by using both a hot spot on the\nsecondary star and a third light. The model represents historical light curves\nalso. All available minimum epochs, including our six timing measurements, have\nbeen examined and indicate that the eclipse timing variation is mainly caused\nby light asymmetries due to the spot activity detected in the light-curve\nsynthesis. The hot spot may be produced as a result of the impact of the gas\nstream from the primary star.

The origin of the macroeconomic\ndynamics is therefore found in the granularity induced by the wealth / capital\nof the wealthiest investors. - Economic cycles consist of a Schumpeter\n'creative destruction' pattern whereby the maxima are cusp-shaped while the\nminima are smooth. In between the cusps, the cycle consists of the sum of 2\n'crossing exponentials': one decaying and the other increasing.\n  This unification within the same theoretical framework of short term market\nfluctuations and long term economic cycles offers the perspective of a genuine\nconceptual synthesis between micro- and macroeconomics.

Non-thermal components in galaxy clusters are indeed unique probes of very\nenergetic processes operating within clusters that drain gravitational and\nelectromagnetic energy into cosmic rays and magnetic fields. These components\nstrongly affect the (micro-)physical properties of the ICM, including viscosity\nand electrical conductivities, and have also potential consequences on the\nevolution of clusters themselves. The nature and properties of cosmic rays in\ngalaxy clusters, including the origin of the observed radio emission on\ncluster-scales, have triggered an active theoretical debate in the last decade.\nOnly recently we can start addressing some of the most important questions in\nthis field, thanks to recent observational advances, both in the radio and at\nhigh energies. The properties of cosmic rays and of cluster non-thermal\nemissions depend on the dynamical state of the ICM, the efficiency of particle\nacceleration mechanisms in the ICM and on the dynamics of these cosmic rays. In\nthis review we discuss in some detail the acceleration and transport of cosmic\nrays in galaxy clusters and the most relevant observational milestones that\nhave provided important steps on our understanding of this physics.

Several explanations have already been\nconsidered, but the existence of dual tracks is not yet fully understood.\n  We suggest that in the hard spectral state re-condensation of gas from the\ncorona into a cool, weak inner disk can provide additional soft photons for\nComptonization, leading to a higher X-ray luminosity in combination with rather\nunchanged radio emission, which presumably traces the mass accretion rate. As\nan example, we determined how much additional luminosity due to photons from an\nunderlying disk would be needed to explain the data from the representative\noutlier source H1743-322. From the comparison with calculations of Compton\nspectra with and without the photons from an underlying disk, we find that the\nrequired additional X-ray luminosity lies well in the range obtained from\ntheoretical models of the accretion flow. The radio/X-ray luminosity relation\nresulting from Comptonization of additional photons from a weak, cool inner\ndisk during the hard spectral state can explain the observations of the outlier\nsources, especially the data for H1743-322, the source with the most detailed\nobservations. The existence or non-existence of weak inner disks on the two\ntracks might point to a difference in the magnetic fields of the companion\nstars. These could affect the effective viscosity and the thermal conductivity,\nhence also the re-condensation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 14:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

It is the aim of this review to\nsummarize the latest developments in this field and to address the issue of\norigin by confronting different brown dwarf and giant planet formation\nscenarios to presently available observational constraints. As examined in the\nreview, if objects are classified as \"Brown Dwarfs\" or \"Giant Planets\" on the\nbasis of their formation mechanism, it has now become clear that their mass\ndomains overlap and that there is no mass limit between these two distinct\npopulations.\n  Furthermore, while there is increasing observational evidence for the\nexistence of non-deuterium burning brown dwarfs, some giant planets,\ncharacterized by a significantly metal enriched composition, might be massive\nenough to ignite deuterium burning in their core. Deuterium burning (or lack\nof) thus plays no role in either brown dwarf or giant planet formation.\nConsequently, we argue that the IAU definition to distinguish these two\npopulations has no physical justification and brings scientific confusion. In\ncontrast, brown dwarfs and giant planets might bear some imprints of their\nformation mechanism, notably in their mean density and in the physical\nproperties of their atmosphere. Future direct imaging surveys will undoubtedly\nprovide crucial information and perhaps provide some clear observational\ndiagnostics to unambiguously distinguish these different astrophysical objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 15:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

This paper\npresents a comprehensive and timely review of the literature on this subject.\nOur key contributions are: (i) a summary of the inherent properties of infrared\nimaging which makes this modality promising in the context of face recognition,\n(ii) a systematic review of the most influential approaches, with a focus on\nemerging common trends as well as key differences between alternative\nmethodologies, (iii) a description of the main databases of infrared facial\nimages available to the researcher, and lastly (iv) a discussion of the most\npromising avenues for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 01:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-03"}

Specifically, TPT is\nused to study the statistical properties of the reactive trajectories by which\ntransitions occur between specific groups of nodes on the network. Sampling\ntools are built upon the outputs of TPT that allow to generate these reactive\ntrajectories directly, or even transition paths that travel from one group of\nnodes to the other without making any detour and carry the same probability\ncurrent as the reactive trajectories. These objects permit to characterize the\nmechanism of the transitions, for example by quantifying the width of the tubes\nby which these transitions occur, the location and distribution of their\ndynamical bottlenecks, etc. These tools are applied to a network modeling the\ndynamics of the Lennard-Jones cluster with 38 atoms (LJ38) and used to\nunderstand the mechanism by which this cluster rearranges itself between its\ntwo most likely states at various temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 10:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}
