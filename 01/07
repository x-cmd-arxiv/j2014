Due to its mass dimension, an Elko can only interact either with\nStandard Model (SM) spinors and gauge fields at 1-loop order or at tree level\nthrough a quartic interaction with the Higgs field. In this Higgs portal\nscenario, the Elko is a viable candidate to a dark matter constituent which has\nbeen shown to be compatible with relic abundance measurements from WMAP and\ndirect dark matter--nucleon searches. We propose a search strategy for this\ndark matter candidate in the channel $pp \\rightarrow l^+ l^- + \\not\\!\\! E_T$ at\nthe $\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV LHC.

This paper presents an elaborate\ncharacterization of the non-stationarity of wireless dual-polarized channels in\ntime. The evaluation is based on urban macrocell measurements performed at 2.53\nGHz. In order to define local quasi-stationarity (LQS) regions, i.e., regions\nin which the change of certain channel statistics is deemed insignificant, we\nresort to the performance degradation of selected algorithms specific to\nchannel estimation and beamforming. Additionally, we compare our results to\ncommonly used measures in the literature.

In this work it is addressed\nthe problem of evaluating invariants of this kind in the case in which the knot\nis discrete, i.e. its trajectory is constructed by joining together a set of\nsegments of constant length. Such discrete knots appear almost everywhere in\nnumerical simulations of systems containing one dimensional ring-shaped\nobjects. Examples are polymers, the vortex lines in fluids and superfluids like\nhelium and other quantum liquids. Formally, the trajectory of a discrete knot\nis a piecewise smooth curve characterized by sharp corners at the joints\nbetween contiguous segments. The presence of these corners spoils the\ntopological invariance of the knot invariants considered here and prevents the\ncorrect evaluation of their values. To solve this problem, a smoothing\nprocedure is presented, which eliminates the sharp corners and transforms the\noriginal path C into a curve that is everywhere differentiable. The procedure\nis quite general and can be applied to any discrete knot defined off or on\nlattice. This smoothing algorithm is applied to the computation of the\nVassiliev knot invariant of degree 2 denoted here with the symbol r(C). This is\nthe simplest knot invariant that admits a definition in terms of multiple line\nintegrals. For a fast derivation of r(C), it is used a Monte Carlo integration\ntechnique. It is shown that, after the smoothing, the values of r(C) may be\nevaluated with an arbitrary precision. Several algorithms for the fast\ncomputation of the Vassiliev knot invariant of degree 2 are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2014 17:45:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 10:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-09"}

In fact, the high\nsurface-to-volume ratios of these systems make single molecule detection\npossible. Further, FET biosensors offer the benefits of high speed, low cost,\nand high yield manufacturing, without sacrificing the sensitivity typical for\ntraditional optical methods in diagnostics.

Recently, it\nwas shown that an increasing dimensionality makes the data resistant to\neffective privacy. The theoretical results seem to suggest that the\ndimensionality curse is a fundamental barrier to privacy preservation. However,\nin practice, we show that some of the common properties of real data can be\nleveraged in order to greatly ameliorate the negative effects of the curse of\ndimensionality. In real data sets, many dimensions contain high levels of\ninter-attribute correlations. Such correlations enable the use of a process\nknown as vertical fragmentation in order to decompose the data into vertical\nsubsets of smaller dimensionality. An information-theoretic criterion of mutual\ninformation is used in the vertical decomposition process. This allows the use\nof an anonymization process, which is based on combining results from multiple\nindependent fragments. We present a general approach which can be applied to\nthe k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness models. In the presence of\ninter-attribute correlations, such an approach continues to be much more robust\nin higher dimensionality, without losing accuracy. We present experimental\nresults illustrating the effectiveness of the approach. This approach is\nresilient enough to prevent identity, attribute, and membership disclosure\nattack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2014 19:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-07"}

All these physical quantities were evolved on-the-fly in a\nself-consistent manner.

Periods of intense star formation are followed by\nphases where stellar feedback drives large-scale outflows and hot bubbles. We\nfind that BH accretion is synchronised with star formation, as only when gas is\ncold and dense do both processes take place. During such periods, gas motion is\ndominated by consistent rotation. On the other hand, when stellar feedback\nbecomes substantial, turbulent motion randomises gas angular momentum. However\nBH accretion is strongly suppressed in that case, as cold and dense gas is\nlacking. In our cosmological simulation, at very early times (z>6), the\ngalactic disc has not yet settled and no preferred direction exists for the\nangular momentum of the accreted gas, so the BH spin remains low. As the gas\nsettles into a disc (6>z>3), the BH spin then rapidly reaches its maximal\nvalue. At lower redshifts (z<3), even when galaxy mergers flip the direction of\nthe angular momentum of the accreted gas, causing it to counter-rotate, the BH\nspin magnitude only decreases modestly and temporarily.

Our goal in this paper is to\nincorporate recently developed out-of-equilibrium statistical concepts into a\nthermodynamically consistent, finite-deformation, continuum framework for\ndeforming amorphous solids. The basic premise is that the configurational\ndegrees of freedom of the material --- the part of the internal energy/entropy\nthat corresponds to mechanically stable microscopic configurations --- are\ncharacterized by a configurational temperature that might differ from that of\nthe vibrational degrees of freedom, which equilibrate rapidly with an external\nheat bath. This results in an approximate internal energy decomposition into\nweakly interacting configurational and vibrational subsystems, which exchange\nenergy following a Fourier-like law, leading to a thermomechanical framework\npermitting two well-defined temperatures. In this framework, internal variables\nthat carry information about the state of the material equilibrate with the\nconfigurational subsystem, are explicitly associated with energy and entropy of\ntheir own, and couple to a viscoplastic flow rule. The coefficients that\ndetermine the rate of flow of entropy and heat between different internal\nsystems are proposed to explicitly depend on the rate of irreversible\ndeformation. As an application of this framework, we discuss two constitutive\nmodels for the response of glassy materials, a simple phenomenological model\nand a model related to the concept of Shear-Transformation-Zones as the basis\nfor internal variables. The models account for several salient features of\nglassy deformation phenomenology.

This directly affects the\ndetermination of the occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in our Galaxy, as\nwell as other planet population statistics.

This method is applied to the lubrication of a\npolymeric liquid composed of short chains with ten beads between parallel\nplates. The rheological properties and conformation of polymer chains coupled\nwith the local viscous heating are investigated with a non-dimensional\nparameter, i.e., the Nahme-Griffith number, which is defined by the ratio of\nthe viscous heating to the thermal conduction at the characteristic temperature\nrequired to sufficiently change the viscosity. The present simulation\ndemonstrates that strong shear thinning and transitional behavior of the\nconformation of the polymer chains occur with a rapid temperature rise when the\nNahme-Griffith number exceeds unity. The results also clarify that the\nreentrant transition of the linear stress-optical relation occurs for large\nshear stresses due to the coupling of the conformation of polymer chains and\nheat generation under shear flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 00:23:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 10:06:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 07:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-29"}

Even the inclusion of the low-dispersion gas which constitutes a\nhigh disc mass fraction does not help in causing swing amplification.

In this paper, we compute light curves and images associated with\ncompact emission regions (hot spots) orbiting around Kerr and non-Kerr black\nholes. We study how the analysis of the properties of the radiation emitted by\na hot spot can be used to test the Kerr nature of SgrA$^*$.

Ab initio calculations are also\ncarried out to study the relative stability of various polymorphs and to use\nthe obtained data in the training set. The original BOP formalism was unable to\naccount for the correct energetic relationship between the B20\n($\\epsilon$-FeSi) and B2 (CsCl) phases and notoriusly slightly favors\nincorrectly the B2 polymorph. In order to correct this improper behavior the\nBOP potential has been extended by a Columbic term (BOP+C) in order to account\nfor the partial ionic character of FeSi. Using this potential we are able to\naccount for the correct phase order between the most stable B20 and B2 (CsCl)\npolymorphs when the net atomic charges are properly set.

The spiral galaxies studied so far show a similar\nmagnetic field pattern which is of spiral shape along the disk plane and\nX-shaped in the halo, sometimes accompanied by strong vertical fields above and\nbelow the central region of the disk. The strength of the halo field is\ncomparable to that of the disk. The total and turbulent magnetic field strength\nis (weakly) increasing with the star formation. There are, however, indications\nthat stronger star formation reduces the magnetic field regularity globally.\nThe magnetic field in spiral galaxies is generally thought to be amplified and\nmaintained by dynamo action. During the galaxy's formation and evolution the\nturbulent dynamo amplifies the field strength to energy equipartition with the\nturbulent gas, while the large-scale (mean-field) dynamo mainly orders the\nmagnetic field. Hence, the large-scale magnetic field pattern evolves with\ntime. Supernova explosions causes a further continuous injection of turbulent\nmagnetic fields. Assuming that this small-scale field injection is situated\nonly within the spiral arm region where star formation mostly occurs lead to a\nlarge-scale field structure in which the magnetic field regularity is stronger\nin the interarm region as observed in several nearby spiral galaxies. The\ndetection of similar scale heights in several spiral galaxies of different\nHubble type star formation implies a relation between the galactic wind, the\ntotal magnetic field strength and the star formation in the galaxy.

In this paper\nwe investigate the influence of a constant dM/dt-flux through the disc, as well\nas the influence of the disc's metallicity on the disc's thermodynamics. We\nfocus on dM/dt discs, which have a net mass flux through them. Utilizing the\nresulting disc structure, we determine the regions of outward migration in the\ndisc. We perform numerical hydrosimulations of dM/dt discs with viscous\nheating, radiative cooling and stellar irradiation in 2D in the r-z-plane.

For a\ndisc of gas surface density and viscosity, we find that the discs thermal\nstructure depends on the product Sigma_G \\nu and the amount of heavy elements,\nwhile the migration of planets additionally to the mentioned quantities,\ndepends on the amount of viscosity itself. As a result of this, the disc\nstructure can not be approximated by simple power laws. During the lifetime of\nthe disc, the structure of the disc changes significantly in a non-linear way\nin the inner parts. In the late stages of the discs evolution, outward\nmigration is only possible if the metallicity of the disc is high. For low\nmetallicity, planets would migrate inwards and could potentially be lost.

However, the sampling is inefficient because the received signal\ncontains only a small number of significant target signals. This paper\nincorporates the compressive sampling (CS) theory into the design of the\nquadrature sampling system, and develops a quadrature compressive sampling\n(QuadCS) system to acquire the I and Q components with low sampling rate. The\nQuadCS system first randomly projects the received signal into a compressive\nbandpass signal and then utilizes the quadrature sampling to output compressive\nI and Q components. The compressive outputs are used to reconstruct the I and Q\ncomponents. To understand the system performance, we establish the frequency\ndomain representation of the QuadCS system. With the waveform-matched\ndictionary, we prove that the QuadCS system satisfies the restricted isometry\nproperty with overwhelming probability. For K target signals in the observation\ninterval T, simulations show that the QuadCS requires just O(Klog(BT/K))\nsamples to stably reconstruct the signal, where B is the signal bandwidth. The\nreconstructed signal-to-noise ratio decreases by 3dB for every octave increase\nin the target number K and increases by 3dB for every octave increase in the\ncompressive bandwidth. Theoretical analyses and simulations verify that the\nproposed QuadCS is a valid system to acquire the I and Q components in the\nreceived radar signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 11:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

It is demonstrated that the\ntemperature of the Lifshitz point at which three second-order transition lines\nmeet is independent of the Cooper pair tunneling strength. The BCS-FFLO\ncritical field becomes lower than the Lifshitz point with increasing the\ninterband tunneling strength, and the resultant phase diagram is qualitatively\ndifferent from that in a single-band superconductor. We also study the\nthermodynamics of Pauli-limiting two-band superconductors with comparable\nintraband pairing interactions.

Our observational campaign aims to better understand\nand describe the multiwavelength data, the physical properties of the system\ncomponents, and the short- and long-term behavior of the component fluxes in RS\nCae. We employ stellar atmosphere, stratified accretion-column, and widely used\nX-ray spectral models. We fit the XMM-Newton spectra, model the multiband light\ncurves, and opt for a mostly consistent description of the spectral energy\ndistribution.\n  Results. Our XMM-Newton data of RS Cae are clearly dominated by soft X-ray\nemission. The X-ray light curves are shaped by emission from the main accretion\nregion, which is visible over the whole orbital cycle, interrupted only by a\nstream eclipse. The optical light curves are formed by cyclotron and stream\nemission. The XMM-Newton X-ray spectra comprise a black-body-like and a plasma\ncomponent at mean temperatures of 36eV and 7keV. The spectral fits give\nevidence of a partially absorbing and a reflection component. Multitemperature\nmodels, covering a broader temperature range in the X-ray emitting accretion\nregions, reproduce the spectra appropriately well. Including archival data, we\ndescribe the spectral energy distribution with a combination of models based on\na consistent set of parameters and derive a lower limit estimate of the\ndistance d > 750pc.\n  Conclusions.

For complex problems and geometries, only numerical simulations\ncan give insight into quantitative and accurate behavior of the seeked\nsolutions. The standard numerical algorithm to solve partial differential\nequations is to split the space and time discretisation separately into\ndifferent uncorrelated methods. Time is usually advanced by explicit schemes,\nor, for too restrictive time steps, by implicit or semi-implicit algorithms.\nThis separate time and space slicing is artificial and sometimes unpractical.\nIndeed, treating space and time directions symmetrically and simultaneously\nwithout splitting is highly recommended in some problems like diffusion.\n  It is the purpose of this work to present a simple numerical algorithm to\nsolve the standard linear scalar advection-diffusion and wave equations using a\nfully spectral method in a two-dimensional Cartesian $(x,t)$ bounded space-time\ndomain. Generalization in three-dimensions $(x,y,t)$ is shown for the pure\ndiffusion problem. The basic idea is to expand the unknown function in\nChebyshev polynomials for the spatial variables $(x,y)$ as well as for the time\nvariable $t$. We show typical examples and demonstrate the spectral accuracy of\nthe method. The great advantage of fully spectral methods resides in their\nhigh-accuracy for a relatively small number of grid points (for sufficiently\nsmooth solutions) compared to standard time-stepping techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 13:44:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-08"}

While\nthe detailed relationship between contact geometry and electronic structure\nrequires a quantitative ab initio approach such as density functional theory\n(DFT), the Kondo many-body effects ensuing from the coupling of the impurity\nspin with metal electrons are most properly addressed by formulating a\ngeneralized Anderson impurity model to be solved with, for example, the\nnumerical renormalization group (NRG) method. Since there is at present no\nseamless scheme that can accurately carry out that program, we have in recent\nyears designed a systematic method for semiquantitatively joining DFT and NRG.\nWe apply this DFT-NRG scheme to the ideal conductance of single wall (4,4) and\n(8,8) nanotubes with magnetic adatoms (Co and Fe), both inside and outside the\nnanotube, and with a single carbon atom vacancy. A rich scenario emerges, with\nKondo temperatures generally in the Kelvin range, and conductance anomalies\nranging from a single channel maximum to destructive Fano interference with\ncancellation of two channels out of the total four. The configuration yielding\nthe highest Kondo temperature (tens of Kelvins) and a measurable zero-bias\nanomaly is that of a Co or Fe impurity inside the narrowest nanotube. The\nsingle atom vacancy has a spin, but a very low Kondo temperature is predicted.\nThe geometric, electronic, and symmetry factors influencing this variability\nare all accessible, which makes this approach methodologically instructive and\nhighlights many delicate and difficult points in the first-principles modeling\nof the Kondo effect in nanocontacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 14:11:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-08"}

We\nparametrize the degree of coherence by the number of coherently emitted\nparticles $N_{coh}$ and show that it is severely constrained by the equivalence\nprinciple. We discuss, in this context, the fate of a shell of matter that\nfalls into a Schwarzschild BH. Two points of view are considered, that of a\nstationary external observer and that of the shell itself. From the perspective\nof the shell, the near-horizon region has an energy density proportional to\n$N_{coh}^2$ in Schwarzschild units. So, if $N_{coh}$ is parameterically larger\nthan the square root of the BH entropy $S_{BH}^ {1/2}$, a firewall or more\ngenerally a \"wall of smoke\" forms and the equivalence principle is violated\nwhile the BH is still semiclassical. To have a degree of coherence that is\nparametrically smaller than $S_{BH}^{1/2}$, one has to introduce a new\nsub-Planckian gravitational length scale, which likely also violates the\nequivalence principle. And so our previously proposed model which has\n$N_{coh}=S_{BH}^{1/2}$ is singled out. From the external-observer perspective,\nwe find that the time it takes for the information about the state of the shell\nto get re-emitted from the BH is inversely proportional to $N_{coh}$. When the\nrate of information release becomes order unity, the semiclassical\napproximation starts to break down and the BH becomes a perfect reflecting\ninformation mirror.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 14:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-08"}

Recently two important\nadvances improved our understanding of this effective theory. First, it was\nrealized that the form of the effective action is strongly constrained by the\nrequirement of the Lorentz invariance of the gauge theory, which is\nspontaneously broken by the formation of a long confining flux tube in the\nvacuum. This constraint is strong enough to fix uniquely the first few\nsubleading terms of the action.

This irrelevant perturbation is quantum\nintegrable and yields, through the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA), the energy\nlevels of the string which exactly coincide with the Nambu-Goto spectrum. In\nthis talk we first review the general implications of these two results and\nthen, as a test of the power of these methods, use them to construct the first\nfew boundary corrections to the effective string action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 15:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-08"}

This effect is\nnow generally accepted to be connected with BEC (Bose-Einstein Condensation).\nThe dispersion relation of pressure waves in superfluid He-4 has been\ndetermined at 1.1 {\\deg}K by Yarnell et al., and exhibits a non monotonic\nbehavior - with a maximum and a minimum - usually explained in terms of\nexcitations called rotons, introduced by Landau. In the present work an attempt\nis made to describe the phenomenon within the bohmian interpretation of QM. To\nthis end, the effects of the intermolecular potential, taken to be essentially\nof the Lennard-Jones type modified to account for molecule finiteness, are\nincluded as a Vlasov-type self-consistent field. A dispersion relation is\nfound, that is in quite good agreement with Yarnell's curve.\n  Keywords: Bohm potential; Intermolecular potential; Dispersion relation;\nSuperfluid He-4; First sound.\n  PACS: 05.30.Jp; 05.20.Dd; 03.75.Kk; 67.25.dt\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 15:47:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Mar 2014 13:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2014 16:17:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 12:47:34 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 18:22:48 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 08:45:38 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 11:29:55 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 20:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-25"}

To\nsustain healthy growth of the community, the Wikimedia Foundation aims to\nquantitatively understand the factors that determine the editing behavior, and\nexplain why most new editors become inactive soon after joining. As a step\ntowards this broader goal, the Wikimedia foundation sponsored the ICDM (IEEE\nInternational Conference for Data Mining) contest for the year 2011.\n  The objective for the participants was to develop models to predict the\nnumber of edits that an editor will make in future five months based on the\nediting history of the editor. Here we describe the approach we followed for\ndeveloping predictive models towards this goal, the results that we obtained\nand the modeling insights that we gained from this exercise. In addition,\ntowards the broader goal of Wikimedia Foundation, we also summarize the factors\nthat emerged during our model building exercise as powerful predictors of\nfuture editing activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 11:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-30"}
