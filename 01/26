To collect massive sensitive data from\nusers, we propose a reward-based collaboration mechanism, where the master\nannounces a total reward to be shared among collaborators, and the\ncollaboration is successful if there are enough users wanting to collaborate.\nWe show that if the master knows the users' collaboration costs, then he can\nchoose to involve only users with the lowest costs. However, without knowing\nusers' private information, then he needs to offer a larger total reward to\nattract enough collaborators. Users will benefit from knowing their costs\nbefore the data acquisition. Perhaps surprisingly, the master may benefit as\nthe variance of users' cost distribution increases.\n  To utilize smartphones' computation resources to solve complex computing\nproblems, we study how the master can design an optimal contract by specifying\ndifferent task-reward combinations for different user types. Under complete\ninformation, we show that the master involves a user type as long as the\nmaster's preference characteristic outweighs that type's unit cost. All\ncollaborators achieve a zero payoff in this case. If the master does not know\nusers' private cost information, however, he will conservatively target at a\nsmaller group of users with small costs, and has to give most benefits to the\ncollaborators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2014 09:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The theory disentangles\nseveral frequencies characterizing the vibrational spectrum: the onset\nfrequency $\\omega_0\\sim \\sqrt{e_c-e}$ where strongly-scattered modes appear in\nthe vibrational spectrum, the pressure-independent frequency $\\omega_*$ where\nthe density of states displays a plateau, the boson peak frequency\n$\\omega_{BP}$, and the Ioffe-Regel frequency $\\omega_{IR}$ where scattering\nlength and wavelength become equal.

In a\ntraditional interface-fitted computational framework, the computation of such\nbasis functions is straightforward, primarily because the computational domain\ndoes not contain in this case a fictitious region.

Prior X-ray observations of this SNR revealed a\nthermal center-filled morphology which contrasts with a shell-like radio\nmorphology, thus establishing G352.7$-$0.1 as a mixed-morphology SNR (MMSNRs).\nOur study confirms that the X-ray emission comes from the SNR interior and must\nbe ejecta-dominated.

However, the effective use of PTZ cameras in\nreal contexts is complicated by the fact that a continuous on-line camera\ncalibration is needed and the absolute pan, tilt and zoom positional values\nprovided by the camera actuators cannot be used because are not synchronized\nwith the video stream. So, accurate calibration must be directly extracted from\nthe visual content of the frames. Moreover, the large and abrupt scale changes,\nthe scene background changes due to the camera operation and the need of camera\nmotion compensation make target tracking with these cameras extremely\nchallenging. In this paper, we present a solution that provides continuous\non-line calibration of PTZ cameras which is robust to rapid camera motion,\nchanges of the environment due to illumination or moving objects and scales\nbeyond thousands of landmarks. The method directly derives the relationship\nbetween the position of a target in the 3D world plane and the corresponding\nscale and position in the 2D image, and allows real-time tracking of multiple\ntargets with high and stable degree of accuracy even at far distances and any\nzooming level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2014 02:23:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 18:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-24"}

Recently, some works aimed to\nbalance the effects of these two important IDNC metrics but none of them\nstudied a further optimization of one by controlling the other. In this paper,\nwe study the effect of controlling the decoding delay to reduce the completion\ntime below its currently best known solution. We first derive the\ndecoding-delay-dependent expressions of the users' and overall completion\ntimes. Although using such expressions to find the optimal overall completion\ntime is NP-hard, we design a novel heuristic that minimizes the probability of\nincreasing the maximum of these decoding-delay-dependent completion time\nexpressions after each transmission through a layered control of their decoding\ndelays. Simulation results show that this new algorithm achieves both a lower\nmean completion time and mean decoding delay compared to the best known\nheuristic for completion time reduction. The gap in performance becomes\nsignificant for harsh erasure scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2014 08:22:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2014 10:56:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 09:24:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-04"}

BigOP is part of an\nopen-source big data benchmarking project, BigDataBench. BigOP's abstraction\nmodel not only guides the development of BigDataBench, but also enables\nautomatic generation of tests with comprehensive workloads.\n  We illustrate the feasibility of BigOP by implementing an automatic test\ngeneration tool and benchmarking against three widely used big data processing\nsystems, i.e. Hadoop, Spark and MySQL Cluster.

To properly\ndescribe vibrational quantum effects in the transport characteristics, we\nintroduce a simple transformation rewriting the Hamiltonian in terms of\noccupation numbers and use a binning function to facilitate quantization. The\napproach provides accurate results for the nonequilibrium Holstein model for a\nrange of bias voltages, vibrational frequencies and temperatures. It also\ncaptures the hallmarks of vibrational quantum effects apparent in step-like\nstructure in the current-voltage characteristics at low temperatures as well as\nthe phenomenon of Franck-Condon blockade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2014 13:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}
