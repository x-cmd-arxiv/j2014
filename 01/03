With the advance of technology, however, markets have become more\nsophisticated. To determine whether this has resulted in an improved market\nefficiency, we investigate whether statistically significant lagged correlation\nrelationships exist in financial markets. We introduce a numerical method to\nstatistically validate links in correlation-based networks, and employ our\nmethod to study lagged correlation networks of equity returns in financial\nmarkets. Crucially, our statistical validation of lead-lag relationships\naccounts for multiple hypothesis testing over all stock pairs. In an analysis\nof intraday transaction data from the periods 2002--2003 and 2011--2012, we\nfind a striking growth in the networks as we increase the frequency with which\nwe sample returns. We compute how the number of validated links and the\nmagnitude of correlations change with increasing sampling frequency, and\ncompare the results between the two data sets. Finally, we compare topological\nproperties of the directed correlation-based networks from the two periods\nusing the in-degree and out-degree distributions and an analysis of three-node\nmotifs. Our analysis suggests a growth in both the efficiency and instability\nof financial markets over the past decade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2014 16:04:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-03"}

The\nprimary aim of this paper is the multiwavelength spectral characterization and\nmodeling of this blazar, which is made particularly interesting by the recent\ndiscovery of a lower limit of its redshift of z > 0.6 and makes it a promising\ncandidate to be the most distant VHE source. The source has been observed with\nthe MAGIC telescopes in VHE gamma rays for a total observation time of ~33.6 h\nfrom 2009 to 2011. The source was marginally detected in VHE gamma rays during\n2009 and 2010, and later, the detection was confirmed during an optical\noutburst in 2011. The combined significance of the stacked sample is ~7.2\nsigma. The differential spectra measured during the different campaigns can be\ndescribed by steep power laws with the indices ranging from 3.5 +/- 1.2 to 5.0\n+/- 1.7. The MAGIC spectra corrected for the absorption due to the\nextragalactic background light connect smoothly, within systematic errors, with\nthe mean spectrum in 2009-2011 observed at lower energies by the Fermi-LAT. The\nabsorption-corrected MAGIC spectrum is flat with no apparent turn down up to\n400 GeV. The multiwavelength light curve shows increasing flux in radio and\noptical bands that could point to a common origin from the same region of the\njet. The large separation between the two peaks of the constructed\nnon-simultaneous spectral energy distribution also requires an extremely high\nDoppler factor if an one zone synchrotron self-Compton model is applied. We\nfind that a two-component synchrotron self-Compton model describes the spectral\nenergy distribution of the source well, if the source is located at z~0.6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2014 16:17:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 09:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

We\nstudy the fine temporal structure of this synchrony in healthy young, healthy\nelderly, and elderly subjects with coronary artery disease. We employ novel\ntime-series analysis to explore how phases of oscillations go in and out of the\nphase-locked state at each cycle of oscillations. For the first time we show\nthat cardiorespiratory system is engaged in weakly synchronized dynamics with a\nvery specific temporal patterning of synchrony: the oscillations go out of\nsynchrony frequently, but return to the synchronous state very quickly (usually\nwithin just one cycle of oscillations). Properties of synchrony depended on the\nage and disease status. Healthy subjects exhibited more synchrony at the higher\n(1:4) frequency-locking ratio between respiratory and cardiac rhythms, while\nsubjects with coronary artery disease exhibited relatively more 1:2 synchrony.\nHowever, multiple short desynchronization episodes prevailed regardless of age\nand disease status. The same average synchrony level could alternatively be\nachieved with few long desynchronizations, but this was not observed in the\ndata. This implies functional importance of short desynchronizations dynamics.\nThese dynamics suggest that a synchronous state is easy to create if needed,\nbut is also easy to break. Short desynchronizations dynamics may facilitate the\nmutual coordination of cardiac and respiratory rhythms by creating intermittent\nsynchronous episodes. It may be an efficient background dynamics to promote\nadaptation of cardiorespiratory coordination to various external and internal\nfactors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2014 17:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

We analysed seven\noptical spectra of the DG Tau jet, taken with the Hubble Space Telescope\nImaging Spectrograph. The spectra were obtained by placing a long-slit parallel\nto the jet axis and stepping it across the jet width. The resulting\nposition-velocity diagrams in optical forbidden emission lines allowed access\nto plasma conditions via calculation of emission line ratios.\n  We find at the base of the jet high electron density, $n_e \\sim $ 10$^5$, and\nvery low ionisation, $x_e \\sim 0.02-0.05$, which combine to give a total\ndensity up to $n_H \\sim $ 3 10$^6$. This analysis confirms previous reports of\nvariations in plasma parameters along the jet, (i.e. decrease in density by\nseveral orders of magnitude, increase of $x_e$ from 0.05 to a plateau at 0.7\ndownstream at 2$''$ from the star). Furthermore, a spatial coincidence is\nrevealed between sharp gradients in the total density and supersonic velocity\njumps. This strongly suggests that the emission is caused by shock excitation.\nThe position-velocity diagrams indicate the presence of both fast accelerating\ngas and slower, less collimated material. We derive the mass outflow rate,\n$\\dot{M}_j$, in the blue-shifted lobe in different velocity channels, that\ncontribute to a total of $\\dot{M}_j \\sim$ 8 $\\pm$ 4 10$^{-9}$ M$_\\odot$\nyr$^{-1}$.

This observing mode can usefully measure the parallaxes\nof bright stars at distances of up to 5 kpc, a factor of ten farther than\nachieved thus far with HST. Long-period classical Cepheid variable stars in the\nMilky Way, nearly all of which reside beyond 1 kpc, are especially compelling\ntargets for parallax measurements from scanning, as they may be used to anchor\na determination of the Hubble constant to ~1%. We illustrate the method by\nmeasuring to high precision the parallax of a classical Cepheid, SY Aurigae, at\na distance of more than 2 kpc, using 5 epochs of spatial-scan data obtained at\nintervals of 6 months. Rapid spatial scans also enable photometric measurements\nof bright Milky Way Cepheids---which would otherwise saturate even in the\nshortest possible pointed observations---on the same flux scale as\nextragalactic Cepheids, which is a necessity for reducing a leading source of\nsystematic error in the Hubble constant. We demonstrate this capability with\nphotometric measurements of SY Aur on the same system used for Cepheids in Type\nIa supernova host galaxies.

Recent data\nshow that the pseudogap is likely a distinct phase, characterized by a medium\nrange and quasi-static charge ordering. However, the origin of the ordering\nwavevector and the mechanism of the charge order is unknown. At the same time,\nearlier data show that precursive superconducting fluctuations are also\nassociated with this phase. We propose that the pseudogap phase is a novel\npairing state where electrons on the same side of the Fermi surface are paired,\nin strong contrast with conventional BCS theory which pair electrons on\nopposite sides of the Fermi surface. In this state the Cooper pair carries a\nnet momentum and belong to a general class called pair density wave (PDW). The\nmicroscopic pairing mechanism comes from a gauge theory formulation of the\nresonating valence bond (RVB) picture, where electrons traveling in the same\ndirection feel an attractive force in analogy with Ampere's effects in\nelectromagnetism. We call this Amperean pairing. Charge order automatically\nappears as a subsidiary order parameter. Our theory gives a prediction of the\nordering wavevector which is in good agreement with experiment. Furthermore,\nthe quasiparticle spectrum from our model explains many of the unusual features\nreported in photoemission experiments. The Fermi arc and the unusual way the\ntip of the arc terminates also come out naturally. We also discuss how the\nonset of the Kerr effect in this state can be accommodated. Finally, we propose\nan experiment which can directly test the notion of Amperean pairing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2014 20:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2014 17:41:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 20:23:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 15:13:46 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2014 15:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-31"}

Research over the past three decades has revolutionized cosmology\nwhile supporting the standard cosmological model.

Until 2013, the largest known structure in our\nUniverse was the Sloan Great Wall, which is more than 400 Mpc long located\napproximately one billion light years away.\n  Aims. Gamma-ray bursts are the most energetic explosions in the Universe. As\nthey are associated with the stellar endpoints of massive stars and are found\nin and near distant galaxies, they are viable indicators of the dense part of\nthe Universe containing normal matter.

The observed morphological and\nkinematic properties are strikingly similar to those of ionized gas around\nobscured (type 2) quasars with matched [O III] luminosity, with marginal\nevidence that nebulae around unobscured quasars are slightly more compact.\nTherefore in samples of obscured and unobscured quasars carefully matched in [O\nIII] luminosity we find support for the standard geometry-based unification\nmodel of active galactic nuclei, in that the intrinsic properties of quasars,\nof their hosts and of their ionized gas appear to be very similar. Given the\napparent ubiquity of extended ionized regions, we are forced to conclude that\neither the quasar is at least partially illuminating pre-existing gas or that\nboth samples of quasars are seen during advanced stages of quasar feedback. In\nthe latter case, we may be biased by our [O III]-based selection against\nquasars in the early \"blow-out\" phase, for example due to dust obscuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2014 21:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 19:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-26"}

Numerous studies of the bulge based on stellar\nphotometry have concluded that the bulge stars are exclusively old. The\nperceived lack of young stars in the bulge strongly constrains its likely\nformation scenarios, providing evidence that the bulge is a unique population\nthat formed early and separately from the disk. However, recent studies of\nindividual bulge stars using the microlensing technique have reported that they\nspan a range of ages, emphasizing that the bulge may not be a monolithic\nstructure.

This is achieved by using a deterministic non-block-based\nnetwork coding scheme, which allows us to sidestep some of the limitations put\nin place by the block coding model used to determine the network capacity.\n  Under the network coding scheme we outline, the sender is able to transmit\nnetwork coded packets above the channel rate of some receivers, while ensuring\nthat they still experience nonzero delivery rates. Interestingly, in this\ngeneralised form of asynchronous network coded broadcast, receivers are not\nrequired to obtain knowledge of all packets transmitted so far. Instead, causal\nfeedback from the receivers about packet erasures is used by the sender to\ndetermine a network coded transmission that will allow at least one, but often\nmultiple receivers, to deliver their next needed packet.\n  Although the analysis of deterministic coding schemes is generally a\ndifficult problem, by making some approximations we are able to obtain\ntractable estimates of the receivers' delivery rates, which are shown to match\nreasonably well with simulation.

In general, Raman frequencies in 2D materials follow quite closely the\nfrequencies of corresponding eigenmodes in the bulk. However, while the modes\nthat are Raman active in the bulk are also Raman active in the thin films, the\nreverse is not always true due to the reduced symmetry in thin films. Here, we\npredict from group theory and density functional calculations that two\nintra-layer vibrational modes which are Raman inactive in bulk WSe2 in our\nexperimental configuration become Raman active in thin film WSe2, due to\nreduced symmetry in thin films. This phenomenon explains the Raman peaks we\nobserve experimentally at ~310 cm-1 and 176 cm-1 in thin film WSe2.\nInterestingly, the bulk mode at ~310 cm-1 that is Raman inactive can in fact be\ndetected in Raman measurements under specific wavelengths of irradiation,\nsuggesting that in this case, crystal symmetry selection rules may be broken\ndue to resonant scattering. Both theory and experiment indicate that the and\nmodes blue-shift with decreasing thickness, which we attribute to surface\neffects.

The overall vision of our community is that simply\nthrough interactions with the system, i.e., through tagging and sharing of\nresources, users would contribute to building useful semantic structures as\nwell as resource indexes using uncontrolled vocabulary not only due to the\neasy-to-use mechanics. Henceforth, a variety of assumptions about social\ntagging systems have emerged, yet testing them has been difficult due to the\nabsence of suitable data. In this work we thoroughly investigate three\navailable assumptions - e.g., is a tagging system really social? - by examining\nlive log data gathered from the real-world public social tagging system\nBibSonomy. Our empirical results indicate that while some of these assumptions\nhold to a certain extent, other assumptions need to be reflected and viewed in\na very critical light.

Here we identify, arguably, the simplest system where this\nclassical problem can be studied: we learnt to operate a fibre laser in laminar\nand turbulent regimes. We show that laminar phase is an analogue of a\none-dimensional coherent condensate and turbulence onset is through a spatial\nloss of coherence. We discover a new mechanism of laminar-turbulent transition\nin laser operation: condensate destruction by the clustering of dark and grey\nsolitons.

Our model contains a perfectly rigid spherical core, which\nis surrounded by an envelope of incompressible uniform density fluid. The\ncorresponding linear problem was studied in previous papers which this work\nextends into the nonlinear regime, at moderate Ekman numbers (the ratio of\nviscous to Coriolis accelerations). By performing high-resolution numerical\nsimulations, using a combination of pseudo-spectral and spectral element\nmethods, we investigate the effects of nonlinearities, which lead to\ntime-dependence of the flow and the corresponding dissipation rate. Angular\nmomentum is deposited non-uniformly, leading to the generation of significant\ndifferential rotation in the initially uniformly rotating fluid, i.e. the body\ndoes not evolve towards synchronism as a simple solid body rotator. This\ndifferential rotation modifies the properties of tidally excited inertial\nwaves, changes the dissipative properties of the flow, and eventually becomes\nunstable to a secondary shear instability provided that the Ekman number is\nsufficiently small. Our main result is that the inclusion of nonlinearities\neventually modifies the flow and the resulting dissipation from what linear\ncalculations would predict, which has important implications for tidal\ndissipation in fluid bodies.

It has\na number of applications in particular in medical imaging. In this article we\nprovide a new general approach to shape deformation analysis, within the\nframework of optimal control theory, in which a deformation is represented as\nthe flow of diffeomorphisms generated by time-dependent vector fields. Using\nreproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of vector fields, the general shape\ndeformation analysis problem is specified as an infinite-dimensional optimal\ncontrol problem with state and control constraints. In this problem, the states\nare diffeomorphisms and the controls are vector fields, both of them being\nsubject to some constraints. The functional to be minimized is the sum of a\nfirst term defined as geometric norm of the control (kinetic energy of the\ndeformation) and of a data attachment term providing a geometric distance to\nthe target shape. This point of view has several advantages. First, it allows\none to model general constrained shape analysis problems, which opens new\nissues in this field. Second, using an extension of the Pontryagin maximum\nprinciple, one can characterize the optimal solutions of the shape deformation\nproblem in a very general way as the solutions of constrained geodesic\nequations. Finally, recasting general algorithms of optimal control into shape\nanalysis yields new efficient numerical methods in shape deformation analysis.\nOverall, the optimal control point of view unifies and generalizes different\ntheoretical and numerical approaches to shape deformation problems, and also\nallows us to design new approaches. The optimal control problems that result\nfrom this construction are infinite dimensional and involve some constraints,\nand thus are nonstandard.

Most of\nthese systems have saturated X-ray emission (log(Lx/Lbol) > -3.5) based on\nX-ray fluxes from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, and many are significantly more\nluminous than main-sequence stars of comparable color. We present parallaxes\nand proper motions, Johnson-Kron-Cousins VRI photometry, and multiplicity\nobservations from the CTIOPI program on the CTIO 0.9m telescope. To this we add\nlow-resolution optical spectroscopy and line measurements from the CTIO 1.5m\ntelescope, and interferometric binary measurements from the Hubble Space\nTelescope Fine Guidance Sensors. We also incorporate data from published\nsources: JHKs photometry from the 2MASS point source catalog; X-ray data from\nthe ROSAT All-Sky Survey; and radial velocities from literature sources. Within\nthe sample of 45 systems, we identify 21 candidate low-mass pre-main-sequence\nmembers of nearby associations, including members of beta Pictoris, TW Hydrae,\nArgus, AB Doradus, two ambiguous 30 Myr old systems, and one object that may be\na member of the Ursa Major moving group. Of the 21 candidate young systems, 14\nare newly identified as a result of this work, and six of those are within 25\nparsecs of the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2014 21:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Here, we\npresent the fundamentals behind scale-conversion, thereby enabling to\nunderstand why at all Sr should be the source- and/ or variation-characterizing\nkey, i.e. why different lab-specific results should be more closely comparable\nas absolute estimates (SrLab1, SrLab2) than as desired-relative (S/D-DELTALab1,\nS/D-DELTALab2) estimates. Further, the study clarifies that: (i) the\nDELTA-scale-conversion (S/W-DELTA into S/D-DELTA, even with the aid of\ncalibrated auxiliary-reference-standard(s) Ai(s)) cannot make the estimates (as\nS/D-DELTA, and thus Sr) free of the measurement-reference W; (ii) the employing\nof (increasing number of) Ai-standards should cause the estimates to be rather\n(increasingly) inaccurate and, additionally, Ai(s)-specific; and (iii) the\nS/D-DELTA-estimate may, specifically if S happens to be very close to D in\nisotopic composition (IC), even misrepresent S; but the corresponding Sr should\nbe very accurate. However, for S and W to be increasingly closer in IC, the\nS/D-DELTA-estimate and also Sr are shown to be increasingly accurate,\nirrespective of whether the S/W-DELTA-measurement accuracy could thus be\nimproved or not. Clearly, improvement in measurement-accuracy should ensure\nadditional accuracy in results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2014 11:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-07"}

We also explore the meanings of these concepts among the\nYanomami, a horticulturist hunter-gatherer tribe in the Orinoquia. Results show\nthat societies previously described as 'guilt societies' have more words for\nguilt than for shame, but the large majority, including the societies\npreviously described as 'shame societies', have more words for shame than for\nguilt. Results are consistent with evolutionary models of shame which predict a\nwide scatter in the relative importance between guilt and shame, suggesting\nthat cultural evolution of shame has continued the work of biological\nevolution, and that neither provides a strong adaptive advantage to either\nshame or guilt. We propose that the study of shame will improve our\nunderstanding of the interaction between biological and cultural evolution in\nthe evolution of cognition and emotions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2014 15:34:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 21:57:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-05"}
