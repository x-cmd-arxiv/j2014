In a set of 149 M- and\nX-class flares observed during the first two years of the SDO mission, AIA\nfinds DEM peak temperatures at the time of the peak GOES 1-8 A flux to have an\naverage of Tp = 12.0+/-2.9 MK and Gaussian DEM widths of log10(sigma_T) =\n0.50+/-0.13. From GOES observations of the same 149 events, a mean temperature\nof Tp = 15.6+/-2.4 MK is inferred, which is systematically higher by a factor\nof TGOES/TAIA = 1.4+/-0.4. We demonstrate that this discrepancy results from\nthe isothermal assumption in the inversion of the GOES filter ratio. From\nisothermal fits to photon spectra at energies of E ~ 6-12 keV of 61 of these\nevents, RHESSI finds the temperature to be higher still by a factor of\nTRHESSI/TAIA = 1.9+/-1.0. We find that this is partly a consequence of the\nisothermal assumption. However, RHESSI is not sensitive to the low-temperature\nrange of the DEM peak, and thus RHESSI samples only the high-temperature tail\nof the DEM function. This can also contribute to the discrepancy between AIA\nand RHESSI temperatures. The higher flare temperatures found by GOES and RHESSI\nimply correspondingly lower emission measures. We conclude that self-consistent\nflare DEM temperatures and emission measures require simultaneous fitting of\nEUV (AIA) and soft X-ray (GOES and RHESSI) fluxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 17:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

While their chiral limit is\nwell understood, recent measurements of the gamma^* omega pi^0 and gamma^*\ngamma pi^0 form factors at high photon virtualities seem to depart from the\nsimplest scaling behavior suggested by QCD. Here we attempt to describe them in\ntheir whole measured energy regimes within the Resonance Chiral Theory, a\nframework which naturally incorporates the chiral limit constraints and extends\nto higher energies by including the resonances as active fields.\n  Specifically, we obtained an accurate description of the data up to 2 GeV on\nthe former form factor by including three multiplets of vector resonances. Good\nagreement with measurements of the latter was possible even in the single\nresonance approximation, although we propose to measure the e^+e^- to\nmu^+mu^-pi^0 cross-section and di-muon invariant mass distribution to better\ncharacterize this form factor.

After investigating existing training\napproaches, it turns out that the performance of the loss-specific training has\nbeen significantly underestimated in existing work. In this paper, we revisit\nthis approach and use techniques from bi-level optimization to solve it. We\nshow that we can get a substantial gain in the final performance by solving the\nlower-level problem in the bi-level framework with high accuracy using our\nnewly proposed algorithm. As a result, our trained model is on par with highly\nspecialized image denoising algorithms and clearly outperforms\nprobabilistically trained MRF models. Our findings suggest that for the\nloss-specific training scheme, solving the lower-level problem with higher\naccuracy is beneficial. Our trained model comes along with the additional\nadvantage, that inference is extremely efficient.

In this ad hoc network,\nthe features were assigned to each group; one neural network classifier per\ngroup was designed and its complexity was optimized. The outputs of the\nclassifiers were fed to a single neuron that provided the required probability\nestimate. The latter was thresholded for final discrimination A dataset\ncomposed of 186 pre-implantation 30-mn Holter recordings of patients equipped\nwith an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in primary prevention was\nused in order to design and test this classifier. 44 out of 186 patients\nunderwent at least one treated ventricular arrhythmia during the six-month\nfollow-up period. Performances of the designed classifier were evaluated using\na cross-test strategy that consists in splitting the database into several\ncombinations of a training set and a test set. The average arrhythmia\nprediction performances of the ad-hoc classifier are NPV = 77% $\\pm$ 13% and\nPPV = 31% $\\pm$ 19% (Negative Predictive Value $\\pm$ std, Positive Predictive\nValue $\\pm$ std). According to our study, improving prophylactic\nICD-implantation candidate selection by automatic classification from ECG\nfeatures may be possible, but the availability of a sizable dataset appears to\nbe essential to decrease the number of False Negatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 18:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-17"}

Therefore, without energy-aware transmission\nschemes, energy can deplete from sensor nodes with smaller energy budget faster\nthan from the rest of the sensor nodes in WSNs. This reduces the coverage area\nas well as the lifetime of WSNs. Collaborative beamforming (CB) has been\nproposed originally to achieve directional gain, however, it also inherently\ndistributes the corresponding energy consumption over the collaborative sensor\nnodes. In fact, CB can be seen as a physical layer solution (versus the media\naccess control/network layer solution) to balance the lifetimes of individual\nsensor nodes and extend the lifetime of the whole WSN. However, the\nintroduction of energy-aware CB schemes is critical for extending the WSNs\nlifetime.\n  In this paper, CB with power allocation (CB-PA) is developed to extend the\nlifetime of a cluster of collaborative sensor nodes by balancing the individual\nsensor node lifetimes. A novel strategy is proposed to utilize the residual\nenergy information available at each sensor node. It adjusts the energy\nconsumption rate at each sensor node while achieving the required average\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination. It is a semi-distributed\nstrategy and it maintains average SNR. Different factors affecting the energy\nconsumption are studied as well. Simulation results show that CB-PA outperforms\nCB with Equal Power Allocation (CB-EPA) in terms of extending the lifetime of a\ncluster of collaborative nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 19:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-17"}

It is used in the context of election verification to publish evidence\nof voting and tallying that voters and officials can check, and where\nchallenges can be launched in the event of malfeasance. In practice, the\nelection authority has responsibility for implementing the web bulletin board\ncorrectly and reliably, and will wish to ensure that it behaves correctly even\nin the presence of failures and attacks. To ensure robustness, an\nimplementation will typically use a number of peers to be able to provide a\ncorrect service even when some peers go down or behave dishonestly. In this\npaper we propose a new protocol to implement such a Web Bulletin Board,\nmotivated by the needs of the vVote verifiable voting system. Using a\ndistributed algorithm increases the complexity of the protocol and requires\ncareful reasoning in order to establish correctness. Here we use the Event-B\nmodelling and refinement approach to establish correctness of the peered design\nagainst an idealised specification of the bulletin board behaviour. In\nparticular we show that for n peers, a threshold of t > 2n/3 peers behaving\ncorrectly is sufficient to ensure correct behaviour of the bulletin board\ndistributed design. The algorithm also behaves correctly even if honest or\ndishonest peers temporarily drop out of the protocol and then return. The\nverification approach also establishes that the protocols used within the\nbulletin board do not interfere with each other. This is the first time a\npeered web bulletin board suite of protocols has been formally verified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 20:11:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-17"}

However, traditional sensitivity\nanalysis methods break down when applied to long-time averaged quantities in\nturbulent fluid flow fields, specifically those obtained using high-fidelity\nturbulence simulations. This is because of a number of dynamical properties of\nturbulent and chaotic fluid flows, most importantly high sensitivity of the\ninitial value problem, popularly known as the \"butterfly effect\".\n  The recently developed least squares shadowing (LSS) method avoids the issues\nencountered by traditional sensitivity analysis methods by approximating the\n\"shadow trajectory\" in phase space, avoiding the high sensitivity of the\ninitial value problem. The following paper discusses how the least squares\nproblem associated with LSS is solved. Two methods are presented and are\ndemonstrated on a simulation of homogeneous isotropic turbulence and the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation, a 4th order chaotic partial differential\nequation.

Young massive cluster (YMC) progenitor\nclouds in the Galactic Center can accumulate to a high enough density without\nforming stars that the initial protostellar densities are close to the final\nstellar density. For this to hold in the disk, the time scale to accumulate the\ngas to such high densities must be much shorter than the star formation\ntimescale. Otherwise the gas begins forming stars while it is being accumulated\nto high density. The distinction between the formation regimes in the two\nenvironments is consistent with the predictions of environmentally-dependent\ndensity thresholds for star formation. This implies that stars in YMCs of\nsimilar total mass and radius can have formed at widely different initial\nprotostellar densities. The fact that no systematic variations in fundamental\nproperties are observed between YMCs in the disk and Galactic Center suggests\nstellar mass assembly is not strongly affected by the initial protostellar\ndensity. We review recent theoretical advances and summarize the debate on\nthree key open questions: the initial (proto)stellar distribution, infant\n(im)mortality and age spreads within YMCs. We conclude: the initial\nprotostellar distribution is likely hierarchical; YMCs likely experienced a\nformation history that was dominated by gas exhaustion rather than gas\nexpulsion; YMCs are dynamically stable from a young age; and YMCs have age\nspreads much smaller than their mean age. Finally, we show that it is plausible\nthat metal-rich globular clusters may have formed in a similar way to YMCs in\nnearby galaxies. In summary, the study of YMC formation bridges star/planet\nformation in the solar neighborhood to the oldest structures in the local\nUniverse.

In particular, we focus on estimation and discrimination\nproblems involving the fractal dimension of the trajectories of a system\nsubject to fractional Brownian noise. We assume that the classical degree of\nfreedom exposed to the environmental noise is coupled to a quantum degree of\nfreedom of the same system, e.g. its spin, and exploit quantum limited\nmeasurements on the spin part to characterize the classical fractional noise.\nMore generally, our approach may be applied to any two-level system subject to\ndephasing perturbations described by fractional Brownian noise, in order to\nassess the precision of quantum limited measurements in the characterization of\nthe external noise. In order to assess the performances of quantum probes we\nevaluate the Bures metric, as well as the Helstrom and the Chernoff bound, and\noptimize their values over the interaction time. We find that quantum probes\nmay be successfully employed to obtain a reliable characterization of\nfractional Gaussian process when the coupling with the environment is weak or\nstrong. In the first case decoherence is not much detrimental and for long\ninteraction times the probe acquires information about the environmental\nparameters without being too much mixed. Conversely, for strong coupling,\ninformation is quickly impinged on the quantum probe and can effectively\nretrieved by measurements performed in the early stage of the evolution. In the\nintermediate situation, none of the two above effects take place: information\nis flowing from the environment to the probe too slowly compared to\ndecoherence, and no measurements can be effectively employed to extract it from\nthe quantum probe.

To solve, or at least reduce these effects, we propose a new scheme to\nrecover a latent image from observed frames by integrating a new variational\nmodel and distortion-driven spatial-temporal kernel regression. The proposed\nscheme first constructs a high-quality reference image from the observed frames\nusing low-rank decomposition. Then, to generate an improved registered\nsequence, the reference image is iteratively optimized using a variational\nmodel containing a new spatial-temporal regularization. The proposed fast\nalgorithm efficiently solves this model without the use of partial differential\nequations (PDEs). Next, to reduce blur variation, distortion-driven\nspatial-temporal kernel regression is carried out to fuse the registered\nsequence into one image by introducing the concept of the near-stationary\npatch. Applying a blind deconvolution algorithm to the fused image produces the\nfinal output. Extensive experimental testing shows, both qualitatively and\nquantitatively, that the proposed method can effectively alleviate distortion\nand blur and recover details of the original scene compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 01:40:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-20"}

In\nsurprising twist, it is inferred from plasmonic investigations that\ncollectively excited graphene electrons must exhibit non-zero mass and its\ninertial acceleration is essential for graphene plasmonics. Despite such\nimportance, this collective mass has defied direct unequivocal measurement. It\nmay be directly measured by accelerating it with a time-varying voltage and\nquantifying the phase delay of the resulting current; this voltage-current\nphase relation would manifest as kinetic inductance, representing the\ncollective inertia's reluctance to accelerate. However, at optical (infrared)\nfrequencies phase measurement of current is generally difficult and at\nmicrowave frequencies the inertial phase delay has been buried under electron\nscattering. Here we directly, precisely measure the kinetic inductance, thus,\ncollective mass, by combining innovative device engineering that reduces\nelectron scattering and delicate microwave phase measurements. Particularly,\nencapsulation of graphene between hexagonal-boron-nitride layers,\none-dimensional edge contacts, and a proximate top gate configured as microwave\nground together enable resolving the inertial phase delay from the electron\nscattering.

The relative abundances of the two flavours in the\ninterstellar medium are still very uncertain, and this abundance ratio has a\nsignificant impact on the thermal properties of the gas. In the context of star\nformation, theoretical studies have recently adopted two different strategies\nwhen considering the ortho:para ratio (OPR) of H2 molecules; the first\nconsiders the OPR to be frozen at 3:1 while the second assumes that the species\nare in thermal equilibrium. As the OPR potentially affects the protostellar\ncores which form as a result of the gravitational collapse of a dense molecular\ncloud, the aim of this paper is to quantify precisely what role the choice of\nOPR plays in the properties and evolution of the cores. We used two different\nideal gas equations of state for a hydrogen and helium mix in a radiation\nhydrodynamics code to simulate the collapse of a dense cloud and the formation\nof the first and second Larson cores; the first equation of state uses a fixed\nOPR of 3:1 while the second assumes thermal equilibrium. Simulations using an\nequilibrium ratio collapse faster at early times and show noticeable\noscillations around hydrostatic equilibrium, to the point where the core\nexpands for a short time right after its formation before resuming its\ncontraction. In the case of a fixed 3:1 OPR, the core's evolution is a lot\nsmoother. The OPR was however found to have little impact on the size, mass and\nradius of the two Larson cores. We conclude that if one is solely interested in\nthe final properties of the cores when they are formed, it does not matter\nwhich OPR is used. On the other hand, if one's focus lies primarily in the\nevolution of the first core, the choice of OPR becomes important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 10:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The eXtended\nConformally Flat Condition (XCFC) for the metric is assumed, allowing us to\nemploy the techniques introduced for the X-ECHO code [Bucciantini & Del Zanna,\n2011, Astron.

The updated XNS code for magnetized neutron star equilibria is made\npublicly available for the community (see\nwww.arcetri.astro.it/science/ahead/XNS).

To relate these constructions, we establish a\nhomomorphism, dubbed the quantum shuffle character, from the dual Hall-Ringel\nalgebra to the quantum shuffle algebra which relates the generalized Feigin\nhomomorphisms.

When endowed\nwith additional heavy fields, such as right-handed neutrinos or extra triplets,\nit also provides a compelling framework for baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We\nderive in this context the full network of Boltzmann equations for studying\nleptogenesis in the flavored regime. To this end we determine the relations\nwhich hold among the chemical potentials of the various particle species in the\nthermal bath. This takes into account the SM Yukawa interactions of both\nleptons and quarks as well as sphaleron processes which, depending on the\ntemperature, may be classified as faster or slower than the Hubble rate. We\nfind that when leptogenesis is enabled by the presence of an extra triplet,\nlepton flavor effects allow the production of the $B-L$ asymmetry through\nlepton number conserving CP asymmetries. This scenario becomes dominant as soon\nas the triplets couple more to leptons than to SM scalar doublets. In this\ncase, the way the $B-L$ asymmetry is created through flavor effects is novel:\ninstead of invoking the effect of $L$-violating inverse decays faster than the\nHubble rate, it involves the effect of $L$-violating inverse decays slower than\nthe Hubble rate. We also analyze the more general situation where lepton number\nviolating CP asymmetries are present and actively participate in the generation\nof the $B-L$ asymmetry, pointing out that as long as $L$-violating triplet\ndecays are still in thermal equilibrium when the triplet gauge scattering\nprocesses decouple, flavor effects can be striking, allowing to avoid all\nwashout suppression effects from seesaw interactions. In this case the amount\nof $B-L$ asymmetry produced is limited only by a universal gauge suppression\neffect, which nevertheless goes away for large triplet decay rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 14:04:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 12:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The model is ruled by the\noblateness parameter of the satellite, the orbital eccentricity, the\ndissipative parameter and the drift term. We devise a method which provides a\nreliable indication on the transient time which is needed to reach an attractor\nin the spin-orbit model; the method is based on an analytical result, precisely\na suitable normal form construction. This method provides also information\nabout the frequency of motion. A variant of such normal form used to\nparametrize invariant attractors provides a specific formula for the drift\nparameter, which in turn yields a constraint - which might be of interest in\nastronomical problems - between the oblateness of the satellite and its orbital\neccentricity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 15:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The global approach gives a\npossibility to find the structure of these manifolds in the general case and\nalso to reveal some properties of the reduced system, first of all, the\nexistence for this system of a global Lagrange function.

In the model\ndifferent memories are attached at cell surface determinants which are the\nresult of DNA recombination.

In the present paper a model is\npresented in which switchboard neurons play a key role in the storage and\nretrieving of memory. And as a consequence, they play a major role in the\nprocess of learning and form the basic material for consciousness. In the\noriginal model there was insufficient explanation for the realization of the\ninternal connection of one cell surface determinant to the other. We realized\nthat tubulin should play a role in these intracellular connections. The tubulin\nmolecules can form a connective wire because of a change of shape of the\nindividual tubulin dimers. This way the fast switch is realized by the switch\nof the tubulin dimer configuration. Because the cell should remember which\nswitch was activated and which one was not or less activated, we postulate the\nmemristor quality of microtubules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2014 10:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}

Following the discovery of the ~11 yr sunspot\ncycle, in 1859 Wolf suggested that the observed solar variability could be\napproximately synchronized with the orbital movements of Venus, Earth, Jupiter\nand Saturn. Modern research have further confirmed that: (1) the planetary\norbital periods can be approximately deduced from a simple system of resonant\nfrequencies; (2) the solar system oscillates with a specific set of\ngravitational frequencies, and many of them (e.g. within the range between 3 yr\nand 100 yr) can be approximately constructed as harmonics of a base period of\n~178.38 yr; (3) solar and climate records are also characterized by planetary\nharmonics from the monthly to the millennia time scales. This short review\nconcludes with an emphasis on the contribution of the author's research on the\nempirical evidences and physical modeling of both solar and climate variability\nbased on astronomical harmonics. The general conclusion is that the solar\nsystem works as a resonator characterized by a specific harmonic planetary\nstructure that synchronizes also the Sun's activity and the Earth's climate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 20:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-02"}
