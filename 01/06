Ohmic diffusion takes over as\nthe instability saturates, leading to strong and impulsive heating (> 20 MK),\nto a quick enhancement of X-ray emission and to the hardening of the thermal\nX-ray spectrum.

However, magnetic\nbraking only operates on the surface layers; it is not yet completely\nunderstood how angular momentum is transported within the star, and how rapidly\nthe spin-down information is communicated to the deep interior. In this work,\nwe use insight from recent progress in understanding internal solar dynamics to\nmodel the interior of other solar-type stars. We assume, following Gough and\nMcIntyre (1998), that the bulk of the radiation zone of these stars is held in\nuniform rotation by the presence of an embedded large-scale primordial field,\nconfined below a stably-stratified, magnetic-free tachocline by large-scale\nmeridional flows downwelling from the convection zone. We derive simple\nequations to describe the response of this model interior to spin-down of the\nsurface layers, that are identical to the two-zone model of MacGregor and\nBrenner (1991), with a coupling timescale proportional to the local\nEddington-Sweet timescale across the tachocline. This timescale depends both on\nthe rotation rate of the star and on the thickness of the tachocline, and can\nvary from a few hundred thousand years to a few Gyr, depending on stellar\nproperties. Qualitative predictions of the model appear to be consistent with\nobservations, although depend sensitively on the assumed functional dependence\nof the tachocline thickness on the stellar rotation rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2014 19:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The purpose of NINJA is to study the ability to detect\ngravitational waves emitted from merging binary black holes and recover their\nparameters with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories. We report\nhere on the results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60\ncomplete binary black hole hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion\nmodelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian\nportion modelling the early inspiral. In a \"blind injection challenge\" similar\nto that conducted in recent LIGO and Virgo science runs, we added 7 hybrid\nwaveforms to two months of data recolored to predictions of Advanced LIGO and\nAdvanced Virgo sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. The\nresulting data was analyzed by gravitational-wave detection algorithms and 6 of\nthe waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in a\nthousand years. Parameter estimation algorithms were run on each of these\nwaveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angular\nmomenta and sky position of these waveforms. We also perform a large-scale\nmonte-carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid\nwaveforms with early Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo sensitivity curves. Our\nresults predict that early Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo will have a\nvolume-weighted average sensitive distance of 300Mpc (1Gpc) for\n$10M_{\\odot}+10M_{\\odot}$ ($50M_{\\odot}+50M_{\\odot}$) binary black hole\ncoalescences. We demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta in\nthe waveform models used in matched-filtering will result in a reduction in\nsensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta.

Monads have been studied mostly in\nalgebraic situations. In this dissertation, we study this concept in some\ncategories of smooth manifolds. Namely, the tangent functor in the category of\nsmooth manifolds is the functor part of a unique monad, which is the main\ncharacter of this dissertation.\n  After its construction and the study of uniqueness properties in related\ncategories, we study its algebras, which are to this monad what representations\nare to a group. We give some examples of algebras, and general conditions that\nthey should satisfy. We characterize them in the category of affine manifolds.\nWe also study an analog of the tangent functor monad and its algebras in\nalgebraic geometry.\n  We then prove our main theorem: algebras over the tangent functor monad\ninduce foliations on the manifold on which they are defined. This result links\nthe study of these algebras to the study of foliations. A natural question is\nthen to characterize foliations which arise this way. We give some restrictions\nin terms of the holonomy of such foliations. Finally, we study in greater\ndetail algebras on surfaces, where they take a very simple form, and we nearly\ncharacterize them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2014 21:05:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-07"}

Using this model to study thick atmospheres\nfor wide ranges of temperatures and elemental abundances, we classify them into\nhydrogen-rich atmospheres, water-rich atmospheres, oxygen-rich atmospheres, and\nhydrocarbon-rich atmospheres. We find that carbon has to be in the form of CO2\nrather than CH4 or CO in a H2-depleted water-dominated thick atmosphere, and\nthat the preferred loss of light elements from an oxygen-poor carbon-rich\natmosphere leads to formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons (C2H2 and C2H4). We\napply our self-consistent atmosphere models to compute spectra and diagnostic\nfeatures for known transiting low-mass exoplanets GJ 1214 b, HD 97658 b, and 55\nCnc e. For GJ 1214 b like planets we find that (1) C2H2 features at 1.0 and 1.5\nmicron in transmission and C2H2 and C2H4 features at 9-14 micron in thermal\nemission are diagnostic for hydrocarbon-rich atmospheres; (2) a detection of\nwater-vapor features and a confirmation of nonexistence of methane features\nwould provide sufficient evidence for a water-dominated atmosphere. In general,\nour simulations show that chemical stability has to be taken into account when\ninterpreting the spectrum of a super Earth/mini Neptune.

We calculate RF spectra for the case\nwhen one of the hyperfine states involved interacts with the BEC, while the\nother state is non-interacting, by performing a non-perturbative resummation of\nthe probabilities of exciting different numbers of phonon modes. In the\npresence of interactions the impurity gets dressed by Bogoliubov excitations of\nthe BEC, and forms a polaron. The RF signal contains a delta-function peak\ncentered at the energy of the polaron measured relative to the bare impurity\ntransition frequency with a weight equal to the amount of bare impurity\ncharacter in the polaron state. The RF spectrum also has a broad incoherent\npart arising from the background excitations of the BEC, with a characteristic\npower-law tail that appears as a consequence of the universal physics of\ncontact interactions. We discuss both the direct RF measurement, in which the\nimpurity is initially in an interacting state, and the inverse RF measurement,\nin which the impurity is initially in a non-interacting state.

The mathematical and physical relevance of the radix economy, also\ncalled digit capacity, is established, showing how physical laws can be derived\nfrom this concept in a unified way. The principle reinterprets and generalizes\nthe principle of least action yielding two classes of physical solutions: least\naction paths and quantum wavefunctions. A new physical foundation of the\nHilbert space of quantum mechanics is then accomplished and it is used to\nderive the Schr\\\"odinger and Dirac equations and the breaking of the\ncommutativity of spacetime geometry. The formulation provides an explanation of\nhow determinism and random statistical behavior coexist in spacetime and a\nframework is developed that allows dynamical processes to be formulated in\nterms of chains of digits. These methods lead to a new (pre-geometrical)\nfoundation for Lorentz transformations and special relativity.

In the nonrelativistic limit regime, i.e. $0<\\varepsilon\\ll1$, the\nsolution to the KG equation propagates waves with amplitude at $O(1)$ and\nwavelength at $O(\\varepsilon^2)$ in time and $O(1)$ in space, which causes\nsignificantly numerical burdens due to the high oscillation in time. The MTI-FP\nmethod is designed by adapting a multiscale decomposition by frequency (MDF) to\nthe solution at each time step and applying an exponential wave integrator to\nthe nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with wave operator under well-prepared\ninitial data for $\\varepsilon^2$-frequency and $O(1)$-amplitude waves and a\nKG-type equation with small initial data for the reminder waves in the MDF.

These\nconservation properties, thus, provide a rational basis for using this\nalgorithm. In linear elastodynamics problems, variants of the trapezoidal rule\nthat incorporate `high-frequency' dissipation are often used, since the higher\nfrequencies, which are not approximated properly by the standard\ndisplacement-based approach, often result in unphysical behavior. Instead of\nmodifying the trapezoidal algorithm, we propose using a hybrid finite element\nframework for constructing the stiffness matrix.

At the architectural level, soft errors are commonly modeled by a\nprobabilistic bit-flip model. In developing such abstract fault models, an\nimportant issue to consider is the likelihood of multiple bit errors caused by\nparticle strikes. This likelihood has been studied to a great extent in\nmemories, but has not been understood to the same extent in logic circuits. In\nthis paper, we attempt to quantify the likelihood that a single transient event\ncan cause multiple bit errors in logic circuits consisting of combinational\ngates and flip-flops. In particular, we calculate the conditional probability\nof multiple bit-flips given that a single bit flips as a result of the\ntransient. To calculate this conditional probability, we use a Monte Carlo\ntechnique in which samples are generated using detailed post-layout circuit\nsimulations. Our experiments on the ISCAS'85 benchmarks and a few other\ncircuits indicate that, this conditional probability is quite significant and\ncan be as high as 0.31. Thus we conclude that multiple bit-flips must\nnecessarily be considered in order to obtain a realistic architectural fault\nmodel for soft errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2014 07:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-07"}

A HZ in this context must satisfy two separate conditions: a\nradiative one and one of dynamical stability. For the case of single stars, the\nusual concept of circumstellar habitable zone is based on the radiative\ncondition only, as the dynamical stability condition is taken for granted. For\nthe radiative condition, we extend the simple formulation of the circumstellar\nhabitable zone for single stars, to the case of eccentric stellar binary\nsystems, where two sources of luminosity at different orbital phases contribute\nto the irradiance of their planetary circumstellar and circumbinary regions.\nOur approach considers binaries with eccentric orbits and guarantees that\norbits in the computed habitable zone remain within it at all orbital phases.\nFor the dynamical stability condition, we use the approach of invariant loops\ndeveloped by Pichardo et al. 2005 to find regions of stable, non-intersecting\norbits, which is a robust method to find stable regions in binary stars, as it\nis based in the existence of integrals of motion. We apply the combined\ncriteria to calculate HZ for 64 binary stars in the solar neighborhood with\nknown orbital parameters, including some with discovered planets. Formulae and\ninterpolating tables are provided, so the reader can compute the boundaries of\nthe HZ for an arbitrary binary system, using the stellar flux limits they\nprefer. Together with the formulae provided for stable zones, these allow the\ncomputation of both regions of stability and habitability around any binary\nstellar system. We found 56% of the cases we consider can satisfy both\nrestrictions, this is a very important constriction to binary systems.\nNevertheless, we conclude that these systems where a dynamical and radiative\nsafe zone exists, must be considered strong candidates in the search for\nhabitable planets\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2014 07:45:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 02:49:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 May 2014 23:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Assuming that the relay is\nsubjected to co-channel interference (CCI) and additive white Gaussian noise\n(AWGN) while the destination is corrupted by AWGN only, we propose three\nheuristic relay precoding schemes to combat the CCI, namely, 1) Maximum ratio\ncombining/maximal ratio transmission (MRC/MRT), 2) Zero-forcing/MRT (ZF/MRT),\n3) Minimum mean-square error/MRT (MMSE/MRT). We derive new exact outage\nexpressions as well as simple high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) outage\napproximations for all three schemes.

The lens rigidity problem is concerned with recovering the metric $g$\ninside $M$ from the corresponding lens relation on the boundary $\\partial M$.\nIn this paper, the stability of the lens rigidity problem is investigated for\nmetrics which are a priori close to a given non-trapping metric satisfying\n\"strong fold-regular\" condition. A metric $g$ is called strong fold-regular if\nfor each point $x\\in M$, there exists a set of geodesics passing through $x$\nwhose conormal bundle covers $T^*_{x}M$.

First, we demonstrate how to\napply machine learning techniques to solve the optimal ordering problem in\nsequential auctions. We learn regression models from historical auctions, which\nare subsequently used to predict the expected value of orderings for new\nauctions. Given the learned models, we propose two types of optimization\nmethods: a black-box best-first search approach, and a novel white-box approach\nthat maps learned models to integer linear programs (ILP) which can then be\nsolved by any ILP-solver.

After\nthe abrupt jumps of May and August 2012 the count rate has been fluctuating\nonly slightly around a constant value, but comparing with data from the LECP\nand the CRS instruments shows that those small variations are only responses to\na varying anisotropy and not to a flux change.

Unfortunately, all known algorithms for computing it take\nOmega(n^2) time, limiting its applicability on large data sets.\n  We observe that for many point sets, the greedy spanner has many `short'\nedges that can be determined locally and usually quickly, and few or no `long'\nedges that can usually be determined quickly using local information and the\nwell-separated pair decomposition. We give experimental results showing large\nto massive performance increases over the state-of-the-art on nearly all tests\nand real-life data sets.

This is\nparticularly an important concern when the enemy has the capability to launch\ncyber-attacks as practical concerns (i.e. avoiding disruption of service,\npresence of legacy systems, etc.) may hinder security. Hence, a defender can\nharden the security posture at certain power stations but may lack the time and\nresources to do this for the entire power grid. We model a power grid as a\ngraph and introduce the cascading failure game in which both the defender and\nattacker choose a subset of power stations such as to minimize (maximize) the\nnumber of consumers having access to producers of power. We formalize problems\nfor identifying both mixed and deterministic strategies for both players, prove\ncomplexity results under a variety of different scenarios, identify tractable\ncases, and develop algorithms for these problems. We also perform an\nexperimental evaluation of the model and game on a real-world power grid\nnetwork. Empirically, we noted that the game favors the attacker as he benefits\nmore from increased resources than the defender. Further, the minimax defense\nproduces roughly the same expected payoff as an easy-to-compute deterministic\nload based (DLB) defense when played against a minimax attack strategy.\nHowever, DLB performs more poorly than minimax defense when faced with the\nattacker's best response to DLB. This is likely due to the presence of low-load\nyet high-payoff nodes, which we also found in our empirical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2014 14:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-07"}

Stability of the flow is assessed solving an eigenvalue problem.\nThe sensitivity gradients which indicate regions of the flow where a passive\ncontrol device could stabilize the unstable eigenvalues are defined within this\nfully discrete framework. Second order finite differences are applied to the\ndiscrete residual to compute the gradients. In particular, the sensitivity\ngradients are shown to be linked to the Hessian of the RANS equations.

The method is tested\non a two dimensional deep cavity case, the flow is turbulent with a Reynolds\nnumber equal to 860 000 and compressible with a Mach number of 0.8. Several\nturbulence models and numerical schemes are used to validate the method.\nPhysical features of the flow are recovered, such as the fundamental frequency\nof the natural flow as well as acoustic mechanisms, suggesting the validity of\nthe method.

The wave profiles that\nparticipate in the collision have different amplitudes. It is shown that,\ncircular polarization with equal amplitude waves does not generate cosmological\nconstant. We also prove that the generation of the cosmological constant is\nrelated to the linear polarization. The addition of cross polarization\ngenerates no cosmological constant. Depending on the value of the wave\namplitudes, the generated cosmological constant can be positive or negative. We\nshow additionally that, the collision of nonlinear em waves in a particular\nclass of Born-Infeld theory also yields a cosmological constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2014 09:41:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2014 13:52:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 15:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-12"}

We then focus on the late time\ninconsistency of the model dubbed age crisis whose resolution requires the\npresence of a repulsive effect that could be sourced either by dark energy or\nby a large scale modification of gravity. By and large, our description is\nbased upon Newtonian cosmology which is simple and elegant despite of its\nlimitations. On heuristic grounds, we explain how a tiny mass of graviton could\naccount for late time cosmic acceleration. We also include a brief discussion\non the underlying physics of Type Ia supernovae explosion and the direct\nconfirmation of late time acceleration of Universe by the related observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2014 11:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}
