Active and adaptive optics (AO), consisting of a wavefront sensor and a\ndeformable mirror, are employed to address this problem. Nevertheless, the\nnon-common-path between the wavefront sensor and the science camera leads to\npersistent quasi-static speckles that are difficult to calibrate and which\nimpose a floor on the image contrast.

The latter approach is a special case of our more general one which\nallows for parton entanglement in high-energy reactions. We discuss signatures\nof parton entanglement in the Drell-Yan reaction. Also for Higgs-boson\nproduction in pp collisions via gluon-gluon annihilation effects of\nentanglement of the two gluons are discussed and are found to be potentially\nimportant. These effects can be looked for in the current LHC experiments. In\nour opinion studying parton-entanglement effects in high-energy reactions is,\non the one hand, very worthwhile by itself and, on the other hand, it allows to\nperform quantitative tests of standard factorisation assumptions. Clearly, the\nexperimental observation of parton-entanglement effects in the Drell-Yan\nreaction and/or in Higgs-boson production would have a great impact on our\nunderstanding how QCD works in high-energy collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 17:00:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2014 14:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Hydraulic conductivities of the soil strata have been calibrated\naccording to piezometers readings, in order to obtain correct range of\nhydraulic loads in tidal mode. Finite element simulation was complemented with\nseries of limit equilibrium analyses. Stability analyses have shown that slope\nfailure occurs with the development of a circular slip surface located in the\nsoft clay layer. Both models (FEM and LEM) confirm that the least stable\nhydraulic condition is the combination of the minimum river levels at low tide\nwith the maximal saturation of soil layers. FEM results indicate that in winter\ntime the levee is almost at its limit state, at the margin of safety (strength\nreduction factor values are 1.03 and 1.04 for the low-tide and high-tide\nphases, respectively); these results agree with real-life observations.

In a few systems the planets reside close to the\ndynamical stability limit. Due to the difficulty of forming planets in such\nclose orbits, it is believed that they have formed further out in the disk and\nmigrated to their present locations. Our goal is to construct more realistic\nmodels of planet migration in circumbinary disks, and to determine the final\nposition of these planets. In our work, we focus on the system Kepler-38. The\nevolution of the circumbinary disk is studied using two-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations. We study locally isothermal disks as well as more\nrealistic models with viscous heating, radiative cooling from the disk\nsurfaces, and radiative diffusion in the disk mid plane. After the disk has\nbeen brought into equilibrium, a 115 Earth-mass planet is embedded and its\nevolution is followed. In all cases the planets stop inward migration near the\ninner edge of the disk. In isothermal disks with a typical disk scale height of\nH/r = 0.05, the final outcome agrees very well with the observed location of\nplanet Kepler-38b. For the radiative models, the disk thickness and location of\nthe inner edge is determined by the mass in the system. For surface densities\nin the order of 3000 g/cm^2 at 1 AU, the inner gap lies close to the binary and\nplanets stop in the region between the 5:1 and 4:1 mean-motion resonances with\nthe binary. A model with a disk with approximately a quarter of the mass yields\na final position very close to the observed one. For planets migrating in\ncircumbinary disks, the final position is dictated by the structure of the\ndisk. Knowing the observed orbits of circumbinary planets, radiative disk\nsimulations with embedded planets can provide important information on the\nphysical state of the system during the final stages of its evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 20:22:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The\nmomentum-driven AGN feedback is modeled with a pair of (small-angle) precessing\njets, and the jet power is calculated based on the accretion rate of the cold\ngas in the vicinity of the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH). The ICM first cools\ninto clumps along the propagation direction of the AGN jets. As the jet power\nincreases, gas condensation occurs isotropically, forming spatially extended\n(up to a few tens kpc) structures that resemble the observed $\\rm H\\alpha$\nfilaments in Perseus and many other cool-core cluster. Jet heating elevates the\ngas entropy and cooling time, halting clump formation. The cold gas that is not\naccreted onto the SMBH settles into a rotating disk of $\\sim 10^{11}$\nM$_{\\odot}$. The hot gas cools directly onto the cold disk while the SMBH\naccretes from the innermost region of the disk, powering the AGN that maintains\na thermally balanced steady state for a few Gyr. The mass cooling rate averaged\nover 7 Gyr is $\\sim 30$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr, an order of magnitude lower than the\nclassic cooling flow value (which we obtain in runs without the AGN). Medium\nresolution simulations produce similar results, but when the resolution is\nlower than 0.5 kpc, the cluster experiences cycles of gas condensation and AGN\noutbursts. Owing to its self-regulating mechanism, AGN feedback can\nsuccessfully balance cooling with a wide range of model parameters. Besides\nsuppressing cooling, our model produces cold structures in early stages (up to\n$\\sim 2$ Gyr) that are in good agreement with the observations. However, the\nlong-lived massive cold disk is unrealistic, suggesting that additional\nphysical processes are still needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 23:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In the Hamiltonian formalism,\ntopological invariants restrict the orbits to submanifolds of the phase space.\nWhile the coadjoint orbits have a natural symplectic structure, the global\ngeometry of the degenerate (constrained) Poisson manifold can be very complex.\nSome invariants are represented by the center of the Poisson algebra (i.e., the\nCasimir elements such as the helicities), and then, the global structure of\nphase space is delineated by Casimir leaves. However, a general constraint is\nnot necessarily integrable, which precludes the existence of an appropriate\nCasimir element; the circulation is an example of such an invariant. In this\nwork, we formulate a systematic method to embed a Hamiltonian system in an\nextended phase space; we introduce mock fields and extend the Poisson algebra\nso that the mock fields are Lie-dragged by the flow vector. A mock field\ndefines a new Casimir element, a cross helicity, which represents topological\nconstraints including the circulation. Unearthing a Casimir element brings\nabout immense advantage in the study of dynamics and equilibria -- the\nso-called energy-Casimir method becomes ready available. Yet, a mock field does\nnot a priori have a physical meaning. Here we proffer an interpretation of a\nCasimir element obtained, e.g., by such a construction as an adiabatic\ninvariant associated with a hidden \"microscopic\" angle variable, and in this\nway give the mock field a physical meaning. We proceed further and consider a\nperturbation of the Hamiltonian by a canonical pair, composed of the Casimir\nelement and the angle, that causes the topological constraint to be unfrozen.\nThe theory is applied to the tearing modes of MHD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 23:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The relative displacement between\nthe interfering wave packets in such open interferometers leads to a fringe\npattern in the density profile at each exit port and a loss of contrast in the\noscillations of the integrated particle number as a function of the phase\nshift.

While the detection of such anomalous\nsubgraphs has received a substantial amount of attention, no\napplication-agnostic framework exists for analysis of signal detectability in\ngraph-based data. In this paper, we describe a framework that enables such\nanalysis using the principal eigenspace of a graph's residuals matrix, commonly\ncalled the modularity matrix in community detection. Leveraging this analytical\ntool, we show that the framework has a natural power metric in the spectral\nnorm of the anomalous subgraph's adjacency matrix (signal power) and of the\nbackground graph's residuals matrix (noise power).

The trends observed verify intuition gleaned\nfrom other signal processing areas, such as greater detection power when the\nsignal is embedded within a less active portion of the background.

One common approach is to perform edge\ndetection. A second approach is to try and detect whole shapes, given the fact\nthat these shapes usually tend to have distinctive properties such as object\nforeground or background. To get optimal results, these two approaches can be\ncombined. This paper adopts a combinatorial optimization method to adaptively\nselect threshold based features to improve remote sensing image. Feature\nselection is an important combinatorial optimization problem in the remote\nsensing image classification. The feature selection method has to achieve three\ncharacteristics: first the performance issues by facilitating data collection\nand reducing storage space and classification time, second to perform semantics\nanalysis helping to understand the problem, and third to improve prediction\naccuracy by avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The goal of this thresholding\nan image is to classify pixels as either dark or light and evaluation of\nclassification results. Interactive adaptive thresholding is a form of\nthresholding that takes into account spatial variations in illumination of\nremote sensing image. We present a technique for remote sensing based adaptive\nthresholding using the interactive satellite image of the input. However, our\nsolution is more robust to illumination changes in the remote sensing image.\nAdditionally, our method is simple and easy to implement but it is effective\nalgorithm to classify the image pixels. This technique is suitable for\npreprocessing the remote sensing image classification, making it a valuable\ntool for interactive remote based applications such as augmented reality of the\nclassification procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 05:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-31"}

This is primarily\ndue to our inability to evaluate the self-energy matrices and the collective\neigenstates of emitters in heterogeneous ensembles. A method to evaluate the\nself-energy matrices that is not limited by the geometry and the material\ncomposition is presented here to understand and exploit such collective\nexcitations. Numerical evaluations using this method are used to highlight the\nsignificant differences between independent and the collective modes of\nemission in heterostructures. A set of n emitters driving each other and m\nother polarizable entities, where N=m+n, is used to represent the coupled\nsystem of a generalized geometry in a volume integral approach. Closed form\nrelations between the Green tensors of entity pairs in free space and their\ncorrespondents in a heterostructure are derived concisely.

The generalisation for p'>2\ntakes the form of functional relations for D(u) and T(u) of polynomial degree\np'. These derive from fusion hierarchies of commuting transfer tangles\nD^{m,n}(u) and T^{m,n}(u) where D(u)=D^{1,1}(u) and T(u)=T^{1,1}(u). The fused\ntransfer tangles are constructed from (m,n)-fused face operators involving\nWenzl-Jones projectors P_k on k=m or k=n nodes. Some projectors P_k are\nsingular for k>p'-1, but we argue that D^{m,n}(u) and T^{m,n}(u) are well\ndefined for all m,n. For generic lambda, we derive the fusion hierarchies and\nthe associated T- and Y-systems. For the logarithmic theories, the closure of\nthe fusion hierarchies at n=p' translates into functional relations of\npolynomial degree p' for D^{m,1}(u) and T^{m,1}(u). We also derive the closure\nof the Y-systems for the logarithmic theories. The T- and Y-systems are the key\nto exact integrability and we observe that the underlying structure of these\nfunctional equations relate to Dynkin diagrams of affine Lie algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 06:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Its significance to more metal-poor, intermediate mass (M >\n2.5Msun) models has yet to be investigated. We show that its inclusion in\nlower-metallicity models ([Fe/H] < -2) is essential, and that there exists no\nthreshold metallicity below which composition-dependent molecular opacity may\nbe neglected. We find it to be crucial in all intermediate-mass models\ninvestigated ([Fe/H] < -2 and 2.5 < M/Msun < 5), because of the evolution of\nthe surface chemistry, including the orders of magnitude increase in the\nabundance of molecule-forming species. Its effect on these models mirrors that\npreviously reported for higher-metallicity models - increase in radius,\ndecrease in Teff, faster mass loss, shorter thermally pulsing AGB lifetime,\nreduced enrichment in third dredge-up products (by a factor of three to ten),\nand an increase in the mass limit for hot bottom burning. We show that the\nevolution of low-metallicity models with composition-dependent low-temperature\nopacity is relatively independent of initial metal abundance because its\ncontribution to the opacity is far outweighed by changes due to dredge-up. Our\nresults imply a significant reduction in the expected number of\nnitrogen-enhanced metal-poor stars, which may help explain their observed\npaucity. We note that these findings are partially a product of the\nmacrophysics adopted in our models, in particular the Vassiliadis & Wood (1993)\nmass loss rate which is strongly dependent on radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 06:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Based on initial experience from\ntwo case studies performed in different environments, the suitability of\ndifferent metrics for predicting defect-prone parts is illustrated.

The morphological classification was provided by the Advanced Camera for\nSurveys General Catalogue (ACS-GC), which used publicly available data obtained\nwith the ACS instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope. Rest-frame photometric\nquantities were derived using kcorrect. We analyse the properties of the sample\nand the evolution of pure-disc systems with redshift. Very massive [$\\log\n(M_\\star/M_{\\odot}) > 10.5$] bulgeless galaxies contribute to ~30% of the total\ngalaxy population number density at $z \\geq 0.7$, but their number density\ndrops substantially with decreasing redshift. We show that only a negligible\nfraction of pure discs appear to be quiescent systems, and red sequence\nbulgeless galaxies show indications of dust-obscured star formation. X-ray\ncatalogues were used to search for X-ray emission within our sample. After\nvisual inspection and detailed parametric morphological fitting we identify 30\nAGN that reside in galaxies without a classical bulge. The finding of such\npeculiar objects at intermediate redshift shows that while AGN growth in\nmerger-free systems is a rare event (0.2% AGN hosts in this sample of bulgeless\ngalaxies), it can indeed happen relatively early in the Universe history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 09:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-31"}

When S3T\nis implemented as a coupled set of equations for the streamwise mean and\nperturbation states, nonlinearity in the dynamics is restricted to interaction\nbetween the mean and perturbations. The S3T statistical mean state dynamics can\nbe approximately implemented by similarly restricting the dynamics used in a\ndirect numerical simulation (DNS) of the full Navier-Stokes equations (referred\nto as the NS system). Although this restricted nonlinear system (referred to as\nthe RNL system) is greatly simplified in its dynamics in comparison to the\nassociated NS, it nevertheless self-sustains a turbulent state in wall-bounded\nshear flow with structures and dynamics comparable to that in observed\nturbulence. Moreover, RNL turbulence can be analyzed effectively using\ntheoretical methods developed to study the closely related S3T system. In order\nto better understand RNL turbulence and its relation to NS turbulence, an\nextensive comparison is made of diagnostics of structure and dynamics in these\nsystems. Although quantitative differences are found, the results show that\nturbulence in the RNL system closely parallels that in NS and suggest that the\nS3T/RNL system provides a promising reduced complexity model for studying\nturbulence in wall-bounded shear flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 12:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-17"}

The set of genus-one fibrations with the\nsame $\\tau$-function and $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ representation, known as the\nTate-Shafarevich group, supplies an important degree of freedom in the\ncorresponding F-theory model which has not been studied carefully until now.\n  Six-dimensional anomaly cancellation as well as Witten's zero-mode count on\nwrapped branes both imply corrections to the usual F-theory dictionary for some\nof these models. In particular, neutral hypermultiplets which are localized at\ncodimension-two fibers can arise. (All previous known examples of localized\nhypermultiplets were charged under the gauge group of the theory.) Finally, in\nthe absence of a section some novel monodromies of Kodaira fibers are allowed\nwhich lead to new breaking patterns of non-Abelian gauge groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 13:48:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 16:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We present our recent progress on\nthe relationship between the metallicity and planet formation, wherein planet\nformation frequencies (PFFs) as well as the critical mass of planetary cores\n($M_{c,crit}$) that can initiate gas accretion are statistically examined. We\nfocus on three different planetary populations that are prominent for observed\nexoplanets in the mass-semimajor axis diagram: hot Jupiters, exo-Jupiters that\nare densely populated around 1 AU, and low-mass planets in tight orbits. We\nshow that the resultant PFFs for both Jovian planets are correlated positively\nwith the metallicity whereas low-mass planets form efficiently for a wide range\nof metallicities. This is consistent with the observed Planet-Metallicity\ncorrelation. Examining the statistically averaged value of $M_{c,crit}$\n(defined as $<M_{c,crit}>$), we find that the correlation originates from the\nbehavior of $<M_{c,crit}>$ that increases steadily with metallicity for two\nkinds of the Jovian planets while the low-mass planets obtain a rather constant\nvalue for $<M_{c,crit}>$. Such a difference in $<M_{c,crit}>$ can define\ntransition metallicities (TMs) above which the Jovian planets gain a larger\nvalue of $<M_{c,crit}>$ than the low-mass planets, and hence gas giant\nformation takes place more efficiently. We find that TMs are sensitive to the\nimportant parameter that involves $M_{c,crit}$. We show, by comparing with the\nobservations, that a most likely value of $M_{c,crit}$ is $\\simeq 5M_{\\oplus}$,\nwhich is smaller than the conventional value in the literature ($\\simeq\n10M_{\\oplus}$). Our results suggest that opacities in planetary atmospheres\nplay an important role for lowering $M_{c,crit}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 13:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-31"}

It represents the transitional stage between\nlinear and non-linear structures and contains easily accessible information\nabout the early phases of structure formation processes.

We quantify the cosmic web components in terms\nof their mass and volume content, their density distribution and halo\npopulations.

This analysis\nidentifies cluster and filaments as the most prominent components of the web.\nIn contrast, while voids and sheets take most of the volume, they correspond to\nunderdense environments and are devoid of group-sized and more massive haloes.\nAt early times the cosmos is dominated by tenuous filaments and sheets, which,\nduring subsequent evolution, merge together, such that the present day web is\ndominated by fewer, but much more massive, structures. The analysis of the mass\ntransport between environments clearly shows how matter flows from voids into\nwalls, and then via filaments into cluster regions, which form the nodes of the\ncosmic web. We also study the properties of individual filamentary branches, to\nfind long, almost straight, filaments extending to distances larger than\n100Mpc/h.

We demonstrate that if an additional source\nof classical noise couples to the resonator (on top of the quantum vacuum), for\nexample via dissipative \"internal modes\", then the resulting spectrum of the\nphotons in the cavity will present two strongly asymmetric branches. However,\naccording to the theory of the dynamical Casimir effect, these branches should\nbe symmetric, a prediction which is confirmed by our experimental data. The\nsimulation presented here therefore shows that the origin of the photons\ngenerated in our experiment with Josephson metamaterials is the quantum vacuum,\nand not a spurious classical noise source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 15:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-31"}

In the two-dimensional limit however, the quantum\ncondensate suffers from the effects produced by disorder and electron\ncorrelations which both tend to destroy superconductivity . The recent\ndiscovery of superconductivity in single atomic layers of Pb, the striped\nincommensurate (SIC) and $\\sqrt{7}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ Pb/Si(111), opened an unique\nopportunity to probe the influence of well-identified structural disorder on\ntwo-dimensional superconductivity at the atomic and mesoscopic scale. In these\ntwo ultimate condensates we reveal how the superconducting spectra loose their\nconventional character, by mapping the local tunneling density of states. We\nreport variations of the spectral properties even at scales significantly\nshorter than the coherence length. Furthermore, fine structural differences\nbetween the two monolayers, such as their atomic density, lead to very\ndifferent superconducting behaviour. The denser SIC remains globally robust to\ndisorder, as are thicker Pb films, whereas in the slighly more diluted\n$\\sqrt{7}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ system superconductivity is strongly fragilized. A\nconsequence of this weakness is revealed at monoatomic steps of\n$\\sqrt{7}\\times\\sqrt{3}$, which disrupt superconductivity at the atomic scale.\nThis effect witnesses that each individual step edge is a Josephson barrier. At\na mesoscopic scale the weakly linked superconducting atomic terraces of\n$\\sqrt{7}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ form a native network of Josephson junctions. We\nanticipate the Pb/Si(111) system to offer the unique opportunity to tune the\nsuperconducting coupling between adjacent terraces, paving a new way of\ndesigning atomic scale quantum devices compatible with silicon technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 15:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-06"}

Here, we show a group of unconventional phenomena\noccurring on the liquid metal objects. Through applying electrical field on the\nliquid metals immersed in water, a series of complex transformation behaviors\nsuch as self-assembling of a sheet of liquid metal film into a single sphere,\nquick mergences of separate metal droplets, controlled self-rotation and planar\nlocomotion of liquid metal objects can be realized. Meanwhile, it was also\nfound that two accompanying water vortexes were induced and reliably swirled\nnear the rotating liquid metal sphere. Further, effects of the shape, size,\nvoltage, orientation and geometries of the electrodes to control the liquid\nmetal transformers were clarified. Such events are hard to achieve otherwise on\nrigid metal or conventional liquid spheres. This finding has both fundamental\nand practical significances which suggest a generalized way of making smart\nsoft machine, collecting discrete metal fluids, as well as flexibly\nmanipulating liquid metal objects including accompanying devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 06:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-10"}

Some attempts to the\ngeometrization of the electromagnetism emerged in this context, where these\nfirst models resided strictly on a classical basis. Posteriorly, they were\nfollowed by more complete and embracing quantum field theories. The present\nwork reconsiders the classical viewpoint, with the purpose of showing that at\nfirst order of approximation the electromagnetism constitutes a geometric\nstructure aside other phenomena as gravitation, and that magnetic monopoles do\nnot exist at least up to this order of approximation. Even though being\nlimited, the model is consistent and offers the possibility of an experimental\ntest of validity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2014 23:07:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 02:08:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 01:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2015 16:34:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 20:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-14"}

The fading channels encountered by the system\nare usually time variant for a mobile receiver. Besides, the frequency response\nof the channel is frequency selective for urban environments where the delay\nspread is quite large compared to the symbol duration. Estimating the channel\nis essential for equalizing the received data and removing the Inter-Symbol\nInterference (ISI) resulting from the dispersive channel. Hence, conventional\ntransceivers insert pilot symbols of known values and detect the changes in it\nin order to deduce the channel response. Because these pilots carry no\ninformation, the throughput of the system is reduced. A Novel modulation scheme\nis presented in this work. The technique depends on using a carrier signal that\nhas no fixed frequency, the carrier tone sweeps the band dedicated for\ntransmission and detects the transfer function gain within the band. A carrier\nsignal that is Frequency Modulated (FM) by a periodic ramp signal becomes\nAmplitude Modulated (AM) by the channel transfer function, and thus, the\nreceiver obtains an estimate for the channel response without using pilots that\ndecrease the systems throughput or data rate. The carrier signal itself acts as\na dynamic frequency domain pilot. The technique only works for constant energy\nsystems, and thus it is applied to PSK transceivers. Mathematical formulation,\ntransceiver design and performance analysis of the proposed modulation\ntechnique are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 14:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-18"}
