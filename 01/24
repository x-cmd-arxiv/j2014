The final\nsingle-letter expression has a very simple form, which was made possible by\nmany novel elements such as a unified framework that represents various network\nproblems in a simple and unified way, a unified coding strategy that consists\nof a few basic ingredients but can emulate many known coding techniques if\nneeded, and new proof techniques beyond the use of standard covering and\npacking lemmas. For example, in our framework, sources, channels, states and\nside information are treated in a unified way and various constraints such as\ncost and distortion constraints are unified as a single joint-typicality\nconstraint.\n  Our theorem can be useful in proving many new achievability results easily\nand in some cases gives simpler rate expressions than those obtained using\nconventional approaches. Furthermore, our unified coding can strictly\noutperform existing schemes. For example, we obtain a generalized\ndecode-compress-amplify-and-forward bound as a simple corollary of our main\ntheorem and show it strictly outperforms previously known coding schemes. Using\nour unified framework, we formally define and characterize three types of\nnetwork duality based on channel input-output reversal and network flow\nreversal combined with packing-covering duality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 16:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 11:56:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 17:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-22"}

The\nprevailing hypothesis for the origin of water on Earth is by delivery through\nwater-rich small Solar system bodies. In this paper, the isotopic and chemical\nevolution of water during the early history of the solar nebula, before the\nonset of planetesimal formation, is studied. A gas-grain chemical model that\nincludes multiply-deuterated species and nuclear spin-states is combined with a\nsteady-state solar nebula model. To calculate initial abundances, we simulated\n1 Myr of evolution of a cold and dark TMC1-like prestellar core. Two\ntime-dependent chemical models of the solar nebula are calculated over 1 Myr:\n(1) a laminar model and (2) a model with 2D turbulent mixing. We find that the\nradial outward increase of the H2O D/H ratio is shallower in the\nchemo-dynamical nebular model compared to the laminar model. This is related to\nmore efficient de-fractionation of HDO via rapid gas-phase processes, as the 2D\nmixing model allows the water ice to be transported either inward and thermally\nevaporated or upward and photodesorbed. The laminar model shows the Earth water\nD/H ratio at r ~<2.5 AU, while for the 2D chemo-dynamical model this zone is\nlarger, r ~<9 AU. Similarly, the water D/H ratios representative of the\nOort-family comets, ~2.5-10 x 10-4, are achieved within ~2-6 AU and ~2-20 AU in\nthe laminar and the 2D model, respectively. We find that with regards to the\nwater isotopic composition and the origin of the comets, the mixing model seems\nto be favored over the laminar model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 16:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In the\nAVQS model, the source state is assumed to vary in an arbitrary manner for each\nsource output due to environmental fluctuations or adversarial manipulation. We\ndetermine the one-way entanglement distillation capacity for AVQS, where we\ninvoke the famous robustification and elimination techniques introduced by R.\nAhlswede.

(Previously, cutoff\nin the full high temperature regime was only known for $d\\leq 2$, and only with\nan $O(\\log\\log n)$-window.)\n  Furthermore, the new framework opens the door to understanding the effect of\nthe initial state on the mixing time.

The model\nincludes a stellar emission component at $\\lambda_{\\rm rest} <$ 3.5$ \\mu$m; a\nhot dust component peaking at $\\lambda_{rest} \\sim$ 5$\\,\\mu$m; and cold dust\ncomponent which becomes significant for $\\lambda_{\\rm rest} >$ 50$\\,\\mu$m. Six\nobjects in the sample are detected at 250 and 350$ \\mu$m.

It relies on the disordered\nlocal moment formalism and the observation that the reduced magnetization in\neach of the investigated materials is accurately described by an equation of\nthe form $M(T)/M(0) = [ 1 -s (T/T_{\\rm C})^{3/2}- (1-s)(T/T_{\\rm C})^{p}\n]^{q}$. The present approach yields interesting results. The alloys at zero\nKelvin share several physical properties: the volume in a partially disordered\nlocal moment state shrinks as the fraction of Fe moments which point down\nincreases in the interval $0 < x^{{\\rm Fe}\\downarrow} < 1/2$, following closely\n$V(0) - 4 [V(0)-V(1/2)] x^{{\\rm Fe}\\downarrow} (1-x^{{\\rm Fe}\\downarrow})$,\nwhile the magnetization collapses, following closely $M(0) - 2 M(0) x^{{\\rm\nFe}\\downarrow}$; the volume in the homogeneous ferromagnetic state greatly\nexceeds that in the disordered local moment state; $x^{{\\rm Fe}\\downarrow}(0)$\nis close to zero. These common properties can account for a variety of\nintriguing phenomena displayed by both alloys, including the anomaly in the\nmagnetostriction at zero Kelvin and, more surprisingly perhaps, the scaling\nbetween the reduced magnetostriction and the reduced magnetization squared\nbelow the Curie temperature. However, the thermal evolution of the fraction of\nFe moments which point down depends strongly on the alloy under consideration.\nThis, in turn, can explain the observed marked difference in the temperature\ndependence of the reduced magnetization between the two alloys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 18:32:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 10:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-19"}

The latter might be important in connection with magnetic spot\nformation, but the growth rate of NEMPI is suppressed with increasing rotation\nrates, although recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) have shown a\nsubsequent increase in the growth rate. We examine quantitatively whether this\nincrease in the growth rate of NEMPI can be explained by an alpha squared\nmean-field dynamo, and whether both NEMPI and the dynamo instability can\noperate at the same time. We use both DNS and mean-field simulations (MFS) to\nsolve the underlying equations numerically either with or without an imposed\nhorizontal field. We use the test-field method to compute relevant dynamo\ncoefficients. DNS show that magnetic flux concentrations are still possible up\nto rotation rates above which the large-scale dynamo effect produces mean\nmagnetic fields. The resulting DNS growth rates are quantitatively well\nreproduced with MFS. As expected, for weak or vanishing rotation, the growth\nrate of NEMPI increases with increasing gravity, but there is a correction term\nfor strong gravity and large turbulent magnetic diffusivity. Magnetic flux\nconcentrations are still possible for rotation rates above which dynamo action\ntakes over. For the solar rotation rate, the corresponding turbulent turnover\ntime is about 5 hours, with dynamo action commencing in the layers beneath.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 18:52:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 16:03:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 10:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-03"}

MWEs pose a huge\nproblem to the precise language processing due to their idiosyncratic nature\nand diversity in lexical, syntactical and semantic properties. The semantics of\na MWE cannot be expressed after combining the semantics of its constituents.\nTherefore, the formalism of semantic clustering is often viewed as an\ninstrument for extracting MWEs especially for resource constraint languages\nlike Bengali. The present semantic clustering approach contributes to locate\nclusters of the synonymous noun tokens present in the document. These clusters\nin turn help measure the similarity between the constituent words of a\npotentially candidate phrase using a vector space model and judge the\nsuitability of this phrase to be a MWE. In this experiment, we apply the\nsemantic clustering approach for noun-noun bigram MWEs, though it can be\nextended to any types of MWEs. In parallel, the well known statistical models,\nnamely Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI), Log Likelihood Ratio (LLR),\nSignificance function are also employed to extract MWEs from the Bengali\ncorpus.

We finally show that if the\ndistortion measure is the mean squared error, or if it is replaced by a certain\nmutual information constraint, the optimal rate can be derived from our main\nresult.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 19:22:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 13:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-05"}

From z=0.5 to\nz=1.3 the LF and CMR are well defined for different galaxy populations and\nM^*_B evolves by ~1.04(1.09)+/-0.06(0.10) mag for the total (red) galaxy\nsample. We compare different criteria for selecting early-type galaxies (ETGs):\n(1) fixed cut in rest-frame (U-V) colours, (2) evolving cut in (U-V) colours,\n(3) rest-frame (NUV-r')-(r'-K) colour selection, and (4) SED classification.\nRegardless of the method we measure a consistent evolution of the red-sequence\n(RS). Between 0.4<z<1.3 we find a moderate evolution of the RS intercept of\nDelta(U-V)=0.28+/-0.14 mag, favouring exponentially declining star formation\n(SF) histories with SF truncation at 1.7<=z<=2.3. Together with the rise in the\nETG number density by 0.64 dex since z=1, this suggests a rapid build-up of\nmassive galaxies (M>10^11 M_sun) and expeditious RS formation over a short\nperiod of ~1.5 Gyr starting before z=1. This is supported by the detection of\nongoing SF in ETGs at 0.9<z<1.0, in contrast with the quiescent red stellar\npopulations of ETGs at 0.5<z<0.6. There is an increase in the observed CMR\nscatter with redshift, two times larger than in galaxy clusters and at variance\nwith theoretical models. We discuss possible physical mechanisms that support\nthe observed evolution of the red galaxy population. Our findings point out\nthat massive galaxies have experienced a sharp SF quenching at z~1 with only\nlimited additional merging. In contrast, less-massive galaxies experience a mix\nof SF truncation and minor mergers which build-up the low- and\nintermediate-mass end of the CMR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 19:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We propose\nthat statistics of novae in nearby galaxies may be a powerful tool to gauge the\nrole of such systems in producing SNeIa. Using multicycle nova evolutionary\nmodels, we compute the number and temporal distribution of novae that would be\nproduced by a typical (unstably burning) SNIa progenitor before reaching the\nChandrasekhar mass limit (M_ch) and exploding. Combined with the observed nova\nrates, this can be used to constrain the maximal contribution of the nova\nchannel to the SNIa rate in nearby galaxies. The M31 nova rate measured by the\nPOINT-AGAPE survey is 65/yr. Assuming that all these novae will reach M_ch, we\nobtain the maximal SNIa rate novae may produce to be (1-5)x10^-4/yr. This\nconstrains the overall contribution of the nova channel to the SNIa rate in M31\nat <2-7%. Furthermore, ~80% of novae generated by a successful SNIa progenitor\nhave short decay times (t2<10 days), and are produced when the WD mass is close\nto M_ch. We point out that statistics of such fast novae can provide a\nsensitive diagnostic of the contribution of the nova channel to the final\nstages of mass accumulation by the single degenerate (SD) SNIa progenitors. To\nexplore the prospects of their use, we investigate the efficiency of detecting\nfast novae in an M31 nova survey of the PTF class. We find that a survey with\nlimiting magnitude of m_R~22 observing at least every 2nd night will catch ~90%\nof fast novae expected in the SD scenario.

The continuous flux\nscenario predicts that a significant fraction of the exogenous material\naccreted by Vesta should be due to non-dark impactors likely analogous to\nordinary chondrites, which instead represent only a minor contaminant in the\nHED meteorites. We explored the continuous flux scenario and its implications\nfor the composition of the vestan regolith, taking advantage of the data from\nthe Dawn mission and the HED meteorites. We used our model to show that the\nstochastic events scenario and the micrometeoritic flux scenario are natural\nconsequences of the continuous flux scenario. We then used the model to\nestimate the amounts of dark and hydroxylate materials delivered on Vesta since\nthe LHB and we showed how our results match well with the values estimated by\nthe Dawn mission. We used our model to assess the amount of Fe and siderophile\nelements that the continuous flux of impactors would mix in the vestan\nregolith: concerning the siderophile elements, we focused our attention on the\nrole of Ni. The results are in agreement with the data available on the Fe and\nNi content of the HED meteorites and can be used as a reference frame in future\nstudies of the data from the Dawn mission and of the HED meteorites. Our model\ncannot yet provide an answer to the fate of the missing non-carbonaceous\ncontaminants, but we discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 20:28:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2014 12:13:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 14:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-13"}

This discrepancy could be the result of some new muon-specific\nforce with O(1-100) MeV force carrier---in this paper we concentrate on vector\nmediators. Such an explanation faces challenges from the constraints imposed by\nthe $g-2$ of the muon and electron as well as precision spectroscopy of muonic\natoms. In this work we complement the family of constraints by calculating the\ncontribution of hypothetical forces to the muonium hyperfine structure. We also\ncompute the two-loop contribution to the electron parity violating amplitude\ndue to a muon loop, which is sensitive to the muon axial-vector coupling.\nOverall, we find that the combination of low-energy constraints favors the mass\nof the mediator to be below 10 MeV, and that a certain degree of tuning is\nrequired between vector and axial-vector couplings of new vector particles to\nmuons in order to satisfy constraints from muon $g-2$. However, we also observe\nthat in the absence of a consistent standard model embedding, high energy\nweak-charged processes accompanied by the emission of new vector particles are\nstrongly enhanced by $(E/m_V)^2$, with $E$ a characteristic energy scale and\n$m_V$ the mass of the mediator.

As x increases from x=0, y(x)\noscillates and thus resembles a quantum wave function in a classically allowed\nregion. At a critical value x=x_{crit}, where x_{crit} depends on a, the\nsolution y(x) undergoes a transition; the oscillations abruptly cease and y(x)\ndecays to 0 monotonically as x-->\\infty. This transition resembles the\ntransition in a wave function that occurs at a turning point as one enters the\nclassically forbidden region. Furthermore, the initial condition a falls into\ndiscrete classes; in the nth class of initial conditions a_{n-1}<a<a_n\n(n=1,2,3,...), y(x) exhibits exactly n maxima in the oscillatory region. The\nboundaries a_n of these classes are the analogs of quantum-mechanical\neigenvalues.

The accretion rates expected from\nplanetesimals that are all the same mass (ie, a mono-mass distribution) are\nexplored both analytically and using a Monte Carlo model, quantifying how\nmeasured accretion rates inevitably depend on sinking time, since different\nsinking times probe different times since the last accretion event. However,\nthat dependence is so dramatic that a mono-mass distribution can be excluded.\nConsideration of accretion from a broad distribution of planetesimal masses\nuncovers an important conceptual difference: accretion is continuous (rather\nthan stochastic) for planetesimals below a certain mass, and the accretion of\nsuch planetesimals determines the rate typically inferred from observations;\nsmaller planetesimals dominate the rates for shorter sinking times. A\nreasonable fit to the observationally inferred accretion rate distributions is\nfound with model parameters consistent with a collisionally evolved mass\ndistribution up to Pluto-mass, and an underlying accretion rate distribution\nconsistent with that expected from descendants of debris discs of main sequence\nA stars. With these parameters, while both DA and non-DA white dwarfs accrete\nfrom the same broad planetesimal distribution, this model predicts that the\npollution seen in DAs is dominated by the continuous accretion of <35km\nobjects, and that in non-DAs by >35km objects (though the dominant size varies\nbetween stars by around an order of magnitude from this value)...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 21:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Presently, among a range of various methods of dMRI, high angular\nresolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) is known to excel in its ability to\nprovide reliable information about the local orientations of neural fasciculi\n(aka fibre tracts). Moreover, as opposed to the more traditional diffusion\ntensor imaging (DTI), HARDI is capable of distinguishing the orientations of\nmultiple fibres passing through a given spatial voxel. Unfortunately, the\nability of HARDI to discriminate between neural fibres that cross each other at\nacute angles is always limited, which is the main reason behind the development\nof numerous post-processing tools, aiming at the improvement of the directional\nresolution of HARDI. Among such tools is spherical deconvolution (SD). Due to\nits ill-posed nature, however, SD standardly relies on a number of a priori\nassumptions which are to render its results unique and stable. In this paper,\nwe propose a different approach to the problem of SD in HARDI, which accounts\nfor the spatial continuity of neural fibres as well as the presence of\nisotropic diffusion.

Therefore, such optimal approaches are not scalable and practically\nundesirable. As a result, almost all existing methods for parking slot\nassignment are simple and greedy approaches, where each car is assigned a free\nparking slot, which is closer to its destination. Moreover, no emphasis is\nplaced to optimize the social benefit of the users during the parking slot\nassignment. In this paper, the fairness as a metric for modeling the aggregate\nsocial benefit of the users is considered and a distributed algorithm based on\nLagrange duality theory is developed. The proposed algorithm is gracefully\nscalable compared to the optimal methods. In addition, it is shown that the\nproposed car parking mechanism preserves privacy in the sense that any car\ninvolved in the algorithm will not be able to discover the destination of any\nother car during the algorithm iterations. Numerical results illustrate the\nperformance of the proposed algorithm compared to the optimal assignment and a\ngreedy method. They show that our algorithm yields a good tradeoff between the\nimplementation-level simplicity and the performance. Even though the main\nemphasis in this paper resides in the car parking slot assignment problem, our\nformulation and the algorithms, in general, can also be applied or adopted in\nfair agent-target assignment problems in other application domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 23:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-27"}

Second, it proposes the\nhyper-differential filter as a means of increasing the accuracy of the AD-LES\nmodel without increasing the computational cost. Box filters, Pad\\'{e} filters,\nand differential filters with a wide range of parameters are studied in the\nAD-LES framework. The AD-LES model, in conjunction with these spatial filters,\nis tested in the numerical simulation of the three-dimensional Taylor-Green\nvortex problem. The numerical results are benchmarked against direct numerical\nsimulation (DNS) data. An under-resolved numerical simulation is also used for\ncomparison purposes. Four criteria are used to investigate the AD-LES model\nequipped with these spatial filters: (i) the time series of the volume-averaged\nenstrophy; (ii) the volume-averaged third-order structure function; (iii) the\n$L^2$-norm of the velocity and vorticity errors; and (iv) the volume-averaged\nvelocity and vorticity correlation coefficients. According to these criteria,\nthe numerical results yield the following two conclusions: first, the AD-LES\nmodel equipped with any of these spatial filters yields accurate results at a\nfraction of the computational cost of DNS. Second, the most accurate results\nare obtained with the hyper-differential filter, followed by the differential\nfilter. We demonstrate that the results highly depend on the selection of the\nfiltering procedure.

Cosmological oscillon emergence is described using a new measure\nof order in field theory known as relative configurational entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 00:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-14"}

Therefore, ELM training is essentially\na linear learning problem, which significantly reduces the computational\nburden. Numerous applications show that such a computation burden reduction\ndoes not degrade the generalization capability. It has, however, been open that\nwhether this is true in theory. The aim of our work is to study the theoretical\nfeasibility of ELM by analyzing the pros and cons of ELM. In the previous part\non this topic, we pointed out that via appropriate selection of the activation\nfunction, ELM does not degrade the generalization capability in the expectation\nsense. In this paper, we launch the study in a different direction and show\nthat the randomness of ELM also leads to certain negative consequences. On one\nhand, we find that the randomness causes an additional uncertainty problem of\nELM, both in approximation and learning. On the other hand, we theoretically\njustify that there also exists an activation function such that the\ncorresponding ELM degrades the generalization capability. In particular, we\nprove that the generalization capability of ELM with Gaussian kernel is\nessentially worse than that of FNN with Gaussian kernel. To facilitate the use\nof ELM, we also provide a remedy to such a degradation. We find that the\nwell-developed coefficient regularization technique can essentially improve the\ngeneralization capability. The obtained results reveal the essential\ncharacteristic of ELM and give theoretical guidance concerning how to use ELM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 01:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-27"}

Circularly polarized light spectra have\nbeen obtained with the Focal Reducer and Low Dispersion Spectrograph at the\nVery Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory and the Intermediate\ndispersion Spectrograph and Imaging System at the William Herschel Telescope.\nNineteen planetary nebulae spanning very different morphology and evolutionary\nstages have been selected. Most of central stars have been observed at\ndifferent rotation phases to point out evidence of magnetic variability. In\nthis paper, we present the result of two observational campaigns aimed to\ndetect and measure the magnetic field in the central stars of planetary nebulae\non the basis of low resolution spectropolarimetry. In the limit of the adopted\nmethod, we can state that large scale fields of kG order are not hosted on the\ncentral star of planetary nebulae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 08:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Consequently, one can write field equations which are equivalent to\nEinstein's at non-singular points, but in addition remain well-defined and\nsmooth at singularities. The black hole singularities appear to be less\nundesirable than it was thought, especially after we remove the part of the\nsingularity due to the coordinate system. Black hole singularities are then\ncompatible with global hyperbolicity, and don't make the evolution equations\nbreak down, when these are expressed in terms of the appropriate variables. The\ncharged black holes turn out to have smooth potential and electromagnetic\nfields in the new atlas. Classical charged particles can be modeled, in General\nRelativity, as charged black hole solutions. Since black hole singularities are\naccompanied by dimensional reduction, this should affect Feynman's path\nintegrals. Therefore, it is expected that singularities induce dimensional\nreduction effects in Quantum Gravity. These dimensional reduction effects are\nvery similar to those postulated in some approaches to making Quantum Gravity\nperturbatively renormalizable. This may provide a way to test indirectly the\neffects of singularities, otherwise inaccessible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 08:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-06"}

Generally, a static binary lens is considered to fit the observed\nlight curve and, when the orbital motion is taken into account, an\noversimplified model is usually employed. In this paper, we treat the\nbinary-lens motion in a realistic way and focus on simulated events that are\nfitted well by a Paczy\\'nski curve. We show that an accurate timing analysis of\nthe residuals (calculated with respect to the best-fitting Paczy\\'nski model)\nis usually sufficient to infer the orbital period of the binary lens. It goes\nwithout saying that the independently estimated period may be used to further\nconstrain the orbital parameters obtained by the best-fitting procedure, which\noften gives degenerate solutions. We also present a preliminary analysis of the\nevent OGLE-2011-BLG-1127 / MOA-2011-BLG-322, which has been recognized to be\nthe result of a binary lens. The period analysis results in a periodicity of\n\\simeq 12 days, which confirms the oscillation of the observed data around the\nbest-fitting model. The estimated periodicity is probably associated with an\nintrinsic variability of the source star, and therefore there is an opportunity\nto use this technique to investigate either the intrinsic variability of the\nsource or the effects induced by the binary-lens orbital motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 09:04:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Unlike other iron pnictide parent compounds where the typical oxidation\nstate of iron is 2, the formal valence of Fe in KFe2As2 is 2.5, corresponding\nto an effective doping with 0.5 hole per iron atom compared to, for example,\nBaFe2As2.

The shift, which is clearly seen on the level of DFT as\nwell as in DMFT, is further enhanced by the strong electronic correlations in\nKFe2As2. In BaFe2As2 the presence of these peaks results [Phys.

The need of improved defense against such\nattacks is therefore more demanding in research. The study conducted in this\npaper can be helpful for readers and researchers to recognize better techniques\nof defense in current times against DDoS attacks and contribute with more\nresearch on the topic in the light of future challenges identified in this\npaper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 11:43:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 19:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-24"}

These usually involve the solution of very\nlarge systems of first order differential equations that are characterized by a\nhigh degree of stiffness. We analyze and compare the performance of the\nexplicit one-step algorithms of Fatunla and Arnoldi. Both algorithms have\nexactly the same stability function, therefore sharing the same stability\nproperties that turn out to be optimum. Their respective accuracy however\ndiffers significantly and depends on the physical situation involved. In order\nto test this accuracy, we use a predictor-corrector scheme in which the\npredictor is either Fatunla's or Arnoldi's algorithm and the corrector, a fully\nimplicit four-stage Radau IIA method of order 7. We consider two physical\nprocesses. The first one is the ionization of an atomic system by a short and\nintense electromagnetic pulse; the atomic systems include a one-dimensional\nGaussian model potential as well as atomic hydrogen and helium, both in full\ndimensionality. The second process is the decoherence of two-electron quantum\nstates when a time independent perturbation is applied to a planar two-electron\nquantum dot where both electrons are confined in an anharmonic potential. Even\nthough the Hamiltonian of this system is time independent the corresponding\ndifferential equation shows a striking stiffness. For the one-dimensional\nGaussian potential we discuss in detail the possibility of monitoring the time\nstep for both explicit algorithms. In the other physical situations that are\nmuch more demanding in term of computations, we show that the accuracy of both\nalgorithms depends strongly on the degree of stiffness of the problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 11:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

For the other two readers the upper dose limit is about 5 times\nlower. It was also found that the Harshaw 3500 shows the best thermal stability\nconsidering the peak maximum position. For the ultra-high doses the differences\nin the spectral characteristics of the applied optical filters and\nphotomultipliers, in conjunction with an evolution of the MCP TL emission\nspectrum with increasing dose, significantly influence the shape of TL glow\ncurves measured with the Riso reader. The detailed characteristic of the\ncompared TLD readers, at high-dose high-temperature range is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 14:44:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 08:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

Video\nquality fairness, as well as similar delivery delays are targeted among\nstreams. The proposed controller is implemented within some aggregator located\nnear the bottleneck of the network. The transmission rate among streams is\nadapted based on the quality of the already encoded and buffered packets in the\naggregator. Encoding rate targets are evaluated by the aggregator and fed back\nto each remote video server (fully centralized solution), or directly evaluated\nby each server in a distributed way (partially distributed solution). Each\nencoding rate target is adjusted for each stream independently based on the\ncorresponding buffer level or buffering delay in the aggregator. Communication\ndelays between the servers and the aggregator are taken into account. The\ntransmission and encoding rate control problems are studied with a\ncontrol-theoretic perspective. The system is described with a multi-input\nmulti-output model. Proportional Integral (PI) controllers are used to adjust\nthe video quality and control the aggregator buffer levels. The system\nequilibrium and stability properties are studied. This provides guidelines for\nchoosing the parameters of the PI controllers. Experimental results show the\nconvergence of the proposed control system and demonstrate the improvement in\nvideo quality fairness compared to a classical transmission rate fair streaming\nsolution and to a utility max-min fair approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 14:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-27"}

Chemistry is employed as\na unique tool 1) to investigate the underlying physical processes and 2) to\ncharacterize the evolution of the chemical composition. We observed a sample of\n59 high-mass star-forming regions at different evolutionary stages varying from\nthe early starless phase of infrared dark clouds to high-mass protostellar\nobjects to hot molecular cores and, finally, ultra-compact HII regions at 1mm\nand 3mm with the IRAM 30m telescope. We determined their large-scale chemical\nabundances and found that the chemical composition evolves along with the\nevolutionary stages. On average, the molecular abundances increase with time.\nWe modeled the chemical evolution, using a 1D physical model where density and\ntemperature vary from stage to stage coupled with an advanced gas-grain\nchemical model and derived the best-fit chi^2 values of all relevant\nparameters. A satisfying overall agreement between observed and modeled column\ndensities for most of the molecules was obtained. With the best-fit model we\nalso derived a chemical age for each stage, which gives the timescales for the\ntransformation between two consecutive stages. The best-fit chemical ages are\n~10,000 years for the IRDC stage, ~60,000 years for the HMPO stage, ~40,000\nyears for the HMC stage, and ~10,000 years for the UCHII stage. The total\nchemical timescale for the entire evolutionary sequence of the high-mass star\nformation process is on the order of 10^5 years, which is consistent with\ntheoretical estimates. Furthermore, based on the approach of a multiple-line\nsurvey of unresolved data, we were able to constrain an intuitive and\nreasonable physical and chemical model. The results of this study can be used\nas chemical templates for the different evolutionary stages in high-mass star\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2014 15:45:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 11:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-19"}

Given an undirected graph G = (N,E) and a valuation\nfunction v : P(N) \\to R over the subsets of nodes, the problem is to find a\npartition of N into connected subsets, that maximises the sum of the components\nvalues. This problem is generally NP-complete; in particular, it is hard for a\ndefined class of valuation functions which are independent of disconnected\nmembers - that is, two nodes have no effect on each other's marginal\ncontribution to their vertex separator. Nonetheless, for all such functions we\nprovide bounds on the complexity of coalition structure generation over general\nand minor-free graphs. Our proof is constructive and yields algorithms for\nsolving corresponding instances of the problem. Furthermore, we derive linear\ntime bounds for graphs of bounded treewidth.
