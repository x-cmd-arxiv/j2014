We believe that resources other than\ncryptographic keys can be used for communication privacy. We consider private\nmessage transmission (PMT) in an abstract multipath communication model between\ntwo communicants, Alice and Bob, in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. Alice\nand Bob have pre-shared keys and Eve is computationally unbounded. There are a\ntotal of $n$ paths and the three parties can have simultaneous access to at\nmost $t_a$, $t_b$, and $t_e$ paths. The parties can switch their paths after\nevery $\\lambda$ bits of communication. We study perfect (P)-PMT versus\nasymptotically-perfect (AP)-PMT protocols. The former has zero tolerance of\ntransmission error and leakage, whereas the latter allows for positive error\nand leakage that tend to zero as the message length increases. We derive the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions under which P-PMT and AP-PMT are possible.\nWe also introduce explicit P-PMT and AP-PMT constructions. Our results show\nAP-PMT protocols attain much higher information rates than P-PMT ones.\nInterestingly, AP-PMT is possible even in poorest condition where $t_a=t_b=1$\nand $t_e=n-1$. It remains however an open question whether the derived rates\ncan be improved by more sophisticated AP-PMT protocols.\n  We study applications of our results to private communication over the\nreal-life scenarios of multiple-frequency links and multiple-route networks. We\nshow practical examples of such scenarios that can be abstracted by the\nmultipath setting: Our results prove the possibility of keyless\ninformation-theoretic private message transmission at rates $17\\%$ and $20\\%$\nfor the two example scenarios, respectively.

The enhancement relies on adding multiple receivers that gather\ndifferent observations of the packets transmitted by a user population in one\nslot.

The key aspect of this structure is that it\nallows to decompose the target fault-tolerant application into three distinct\ncomponents, respectively responsible for (1) the functional service, (2) the\nmanagement of the fault tolerance provisions, and (3) the adaptation to the\ncurrent environmental conditions. The paper also briefly mentions a few case\nstudies and preliminary results obtained exercising the prototype.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 17:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-16"}

The nature of the high-temperature events that produced them\nin the early solar system remains enigmatic. Beside their thermal history, one\nimportant clue is provided by their size which shows remarkably little\nvariation (less than a factor of 6 for the mean chondrule radius of most\nchondrites) despite the extensive range of ages and heliocentric distances\nsampled. It is however unclear whether chondrule size is due to the chondrule\nmelting process itself, or has been simply inherited from the precursor\nmaterial, or yet results from some sorting process. I examine these different\npossibilities in terms of their analytical size predictions. Unless the\nchondrule-forming \"window\" was very narrow, radial sorting can be excluded as\nsize-determining processes because of the large variations it would predict.\nMolten planetesimal collision or impact melting models, which derive chondrules\nfrom the fragmentation of larger melt bodies, would likewise predict too much\nsize variability by themselves; more generally any size modification during\nchondrule formation is limited in extent by evidence from compound chondrules\nand the considerable compositional variability of chondrules. Turbulent\nconcentration would predict a low size variability but lack of evidence of any\naccretion bias in carbonaceous chondrites may be difficult to reconcile with\nany form of local sorting upon agglomeration. Growth by sticking (especially if\nbouncing-limited) of aggregates as chondrule precursors would yield limited\nvariations of their final radius in space and time, and would be consistent\nwith the relatively similar size of other chondrite components such as\nrefractory inclusions. This suggests that the chondrule-melting process(es)\nsimply melted such nebular aggregates with little modification of mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 20:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We carry out a comparison of methods that aim to fill the\ngaps to correct for the systematic effects. Our study is motivated by the\nanalysis of the VIMOS Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS), a flux-limited\nsurvey (i<22.5) based on one-pass observations with VIMOS, with gaps covering\n25% of the surveyed area and a mean sampling rate of 35%.

Using galaxy mock\ncatalogues we quantify the accuracy of the counts-in-cells measurements on\nscales of R=5 and 8 Mpc/h after applying each of these methods. We also study\nhow they perform to account for spectroscopic redshift error and inhomogeneous\nand sparse sampling rate. We find that in VIPERS the errors in counts-in-cells\nmeasurements on R<10 Mpc/h scales are dominated by the sparseness of the\nsample. All methods underpredict by 20-35% the counts at high densities. This\nsystematic bias is of the same order as random errors. No method outperforms\nthe others. Random and systematic errors decrease for larger cells. We show\nthat it is possible to separate the lowest and highest densities on scales of 5\nMpc/h at redshifts 0.5<z<1.1, over a large volume such as in VIPERS survey.\nThis is vital for the characterisation of cosmic variance and rare populations\n(e.g, brightest galaxies) in environmental studies at these redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 21:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 09:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-14"}

While\ninterferometric measurements of stellar angular diameters are the most direct\nmethod to gauge these, they are still limited to relatively nearby and bright\nstars, which are saturated in most of the modern photometric surveys. This\ndichotomy prevents us from safely extending well calibrated relations to the\nfaint stars targeted in large spectroscopic and photometric surveys. Here, we\nalleviate this obstacle by presenting SAAO near-infrared JHK observations of 55\nstars: 16 of them have interferometric angular diameters, and the rest are in\ncommon with the 2MASS (unsaturated) dataset, allowing us to tie the effective\ntemperatures and angular diameters derived via the Infrared Flux Method to the\ninterferometric scale. We extend the test to recent interferometric\nmeasurements of unsaturated 2MASS stars, including giants, and the metal-poor\nbenchmark target HD122563. With a critical evaluation of the systematics\ninvolved, we conclude that a 1% accuracy in fundamental stellar parameters is\nusually within reach. Caution, however, must be used when indirectly testing a\ntemperature scale via colour relations, as well as when assessing the\nreliability of interferometric measurements, especially at sub-milliarcsec\nlevel. As a result, rather different effective temperature scales can be\ncompatible with a given subset of interferometric data. We highlight some\ncaveats to be aware of in such a quest, and suggest a simple method to check\nagainst systematics in fundamental measurements.

When data are sensitive,\nit is in the interest of the entity to outsource encrypted data to the cloud;\nhowever, this limits the types of operations that can be performed on the cloud\nside. Especially, evaluating queries over the encrypted data stored on the\ncloud without the entity performing any computation and without ever decrypting\nthe data become a very challenging problem. In this paper, we propose solutions\nto conduct range queries over outsourced encrypted data. The existing methods\nleak valuable information to the cloud which can violate the security guarantee\nof the underlying encryption schemes. In general, the main security primitive\nused to evaluate range queries is secure comparison (SC) of encrypted integers.\nHowever, we observe that the existing SC protocols are not very efficient. To\nthis end, we first propose a novel SC scheme that takes encrypted integers and\noutputs encrypted comparison result.

Finally, in the VRP with private fleet and\ncommon carrier, some customers can be delegated to an external carrier subject\nto a cost. Three families of combined decisions must be taken: customers\nselection, assignment to vehicles, and sequencing of deliveries for each route.\n  We propose a new neighborhood search for these problems which explores an\nexponential number of solutions in pseudo polynomial time. The search is\nconducted with standard VRP neighborhoods on an \"exhaustive\" solution\nrepresentation, visiting all customers. Since visiting all customers is usually\ninfeasible or sub-optimal, an efficient \"Select\" algorithm, based on resource\nconstrained shortest paths, is repeatedly used on any new route to find the\noptimal subsequence of visits to customers. The good performance of these\nneighborhood structures is demonstrated by extensive computational experiments\nwith a local search, an iterated local search and a hybrid genetic algorithm.\nIntriguingly, even a local-improvement method to the first local optimum of\nthis neighborhood achieves an average gap of 0.09% on classic team orienteering\nbenchmark instances, rivaling with the current state-of-the-art metaheuristics.\nPromising research avenues on hybridizations with more standard routing\nneighborhoods are also open.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 23:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Jul 2014 22:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}

The nonlinearity of\nthe contact area evolution, preserved for the entire range of pressures, is\nespecially strong close to infinitesimal contact.

DCL-PC extends CL-PC with dynamic\nlogic modalities in which atomic programs are of the form agent i gives control\nof variable p to agent j; as usual in dynamic logic, these atomic programs may\nbe combined using sequence, iteration, choice, and test operators to form\ncomplex programs. By combining such dynamic transfer programs with cooperation\nmodalities, it becomes possible to reason about how the power of agents and\ncoalitions is affected by the transfer of control. We give two alternative\nsemantics for the logic: a direct semantics, in which we capture the\ndistributions of Boolean variables to agents; and a more conventional Kripke\nsemantics. We prove that these semantics are equivalent, and then present an\naxiomatization for the logic. We investigate the computational complexity of\nmodel checking and satisfiability for DCL-PC, and show that both problems are\nPSPACE-complete (and hence no worse than the underlying logic CL-PC). Finally,\nwe investigate the characterisation of control in DCL-PC. We distinguish\nbetween first-order control -- the ability of an agent or coalition to control\nsome state of affairs through the assignment of values to the variables under\nthe control of the agent or coalition -- and second-order control -- the\nability of an agent to exert control over the control that other agents have by\ntransferring variables to other agents. We give a logical characterisation of\nsecond-order control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:27:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-17"}

Consequently, computational systems that can reason about narrative\ncan be more effective communicators, entertainers, educators, and trainers. One\nof the central challenges in computational narrative reasoning is narrative\ngeneration, the automated creation of meaningful event sequences. There are\nmany factors -- logical and aesthetic -- that contribute to the success of a\nnarrative artifact. Central to this success is its understandability. We argue\nthat the following two attributes of narratives are universal: (a) the logical\ncausal progression of plot, and (b) character believability. Character\nbelievability is the perception by the audience that the actions performed by\ncharacters do not negatively impact the audiences suspension of disbelief.\nSpecifically, characters must be perceived by the audience to be intentional\nagents. In this article, we explore the use of refinement search as a technique\nfor solving the narrative generation problem -- to find a sound and believable\nsequence of character actions that transforms an initial world state into a\nworld state in which goal propositions hold. We describe a novel refinement\nsearch planning algorithm -- the Intent-based Partial Order Causal Link (IPOCL)\nplanner -- that, in addition to creating causally sound plot progression,\nreasons about character intentionality by identifying possible character goals\nthat explain their actions and creating plan structures that explain why those\ncharacters commit to their goals.

Angle-Propagation Theta* achieves a better worst-case\ncomplexity per vertex expansion than Basic Theta* by propagating angle ranges\nwhen it expands vertices, but is more complex, not as fast and finds slightly\nlonger paths. We refer to Basic Theta* and Angle-Propagation Theta*\ncollectively as Theta*. Theta* has unique properties, which we analyze in\ndetail. We show experimentally that it finds shorter paths than both A* with\npost-smoothed paths and Field D* (the only other version of A* we know of that\npropagates information along grid edges without constraining paths to grid\nedges) with a runtime comparable to that of A* on grids. Finally, we extend\nTheta* to grids that contain unblocked cells with non-uniform traversal costs\nand introduce variants of Theta* which provide different tradeoffs between path\nlength and runtime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-17"}

In this paper we present a novel\napproach to this problem, called the Lemma-Lifting approach. The main idea is\nto combine an SMT solver with an external propositional core extractor. The SMT\nsolver produces the theory lemmas found during the search, dynamically lifting\nthe suitable amount of theory information to the Boolean level. The core\nextractor is then called on the Boolean abstraction of the original SMT problem\nand of the theory lemmas. This results in an unsatisfiable core for the\noriginal SMT problem, once the remaining theory lemmas are removed. The\napproach is conceptually interesting, and has several advantages in practice.\nIn fact, it is extremely simple to implement and to update, and it can be\ninterfaced with every propositional core extractor in a plug-and-play manner,\nso as to benefit for free of all unsat-core reduction techniques which have\nbeen or will be made available.\n  We have evaluated our algorithm with a very extensive empirical test on\nSMT-LIB benchmarks, which confirms the validity and potential of this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-17"}

Alternatively, one can\nstart multiple instances of a local search algorithm, and allocate\ncomputational resources (in particular, processing time) to the instances\ndepending on their behavior. Hence, a multi-start strategy has to decide\n(dynamically) when to allocate additional resources to a particular instance\nand when to start new instances.

For a two-state model, a\n'stationary' rupture force distribution that is proportional to the population\ncan be defined and allows to consistently discuss quantities averaged over the\ntransient fluctuations.

We present our evolution models for the\nabundance of PAHs in the ISM on a galaxy-evolution timescale. We consider\nshattering of carbonaceous dust grains in interstellar turbulence as the\nformation mechanism of PAHs while the PAH abundance can be reduced by\ncoagulation onto dust grains, destruction by supernova shocks, and\nincorporation into stars. We implement these processes in a one-zone chemical\nevolution model to obtain the evolution of the PAH abundance in a galaxy. We\nfind that PAH formation becomes accelerated above certain metallicity where\nshattering becomes efficient. For PAH destruction, while supernova shock is the\nprimary mechanism in the metal-poor environment, coagulation is dominant in the\nmetal-rich environment. We compare the evolution of the PAH abundances in our\nmodels with observed abundances in galaxies with a wide metallicity range. Our\nmodels reproduce both the paucity of PAH detection in low metallicity galaxies\nand the metallicity-dependence of the PAH abundance in high-metallicity\ngalaxies. The strong metallicity dependence of PAH abundance appears as a\nresult of the strong metallicity dependence of the dust mass increase by the\naccretion of metals onto dust grains, which are eventually shattered into PAHs.\nWe conclude that the observational trend of the PAH abundance can be a natural\nconsequence of shattering of carbonaceous grains being the source of PAHs. To\nestablish our scenario of PAH formation, observational evidence of PAH\nformation by shattering would be crucial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 09:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Ground states are found by\nminimizing energy over deformations and configurations. Pairing in odd\nparticle-number systems is treated either by blocking or by adding the BCS\nenergy of the odd quasiparticle. Three new parameters are introduced which may\nbe interpreted as the constant mean pairing energies for even-odd, odd-even and\nodd-odd nuclei. They are adjusted by a fit to masses of heavy nuclei. Other\nparameters of the model, fixed previously by fitting masses of even-even heavy\nnuclei, are kept unchanged. With this adjustment, the masses of SH nuclei are\npredicted and then used to calculate $\\alpha$-decay energies to be compared to\nknown measured values. It turns out that the agreement between calculated\n$Q_{\\alpha}$ values with data in SH nuclei is better than in the region of the\nmass fit. The model overestimates $Q_{\\alpha}$ for $Z=111-113$.

More\nprecisely, the weight in the i-th position of the run is divided by\n$\\lambda^i$, where the discount factor $\\lambda$ is a fixed rational number\ngreater than 1. The value of a word is the minimal value of the automaton runs\non it. Discounted summation is a common and useful measuring scheme, especially\nfor infinite sequences, reflecting the assumption that earlier weights are more\nimportant than later weights. Unfortunately, determinization of NDAs, which is\noften essential in formal verification, is, in general, not possible. We\nprovide positive news, showing that every NDA with an integral discount factor\nis determinizable. We complete the picture by proving that the integers\ncharacterize exactly the discount factors that guarantee determinizability: for\nevery nonintegral rational discount factor $\\lambda$, there is a\nnondeterminizable $\\lambda$-NDA. We also prove that the class of NDAs with\nintegral discount factors enjoys closure under the algebraic operations min,\nmax, addition, and subtraction, which is not the case for general NDAs nor for\ndeterministic NDAs. For general NDAs, we look into approximate determinization,\nwhich is always possible as the influence of a word's suffix decays. We show\nthat the naive approach, of unfolding the automaton computations up to a\nsufficient level, is doubly exponential in the discount factor. We provide an\nalternative construction for approximate determinization, which is singly\nexponential in the discount factor, in the precision, and in the number of\nstates.

The\npresent study takes into account the expected high energy spectrum of the\nsimultaneous radiation by neutrons, protons, pions, electrons and photons,\ncalculated using the FLUKA code by F. Cerutti (CERN) as well as on literature\nvalues. It was found that proton irradiation causes a considerably higher\ndamage than neutron irradiation: in spite of a 3.8% proton fraction, the\nmeasured damage is of the order of 20%, which fits with the calculations of N.\nMokhov (Fermilab) on the contribution of protons to the dpa. The same\ncalculations indicate that the total effect of protons, pions and electrons is\nat least as high as that of neutrons. Since recent neutron experiments of\nNakamoto et al. show that the RRR of Cu is reduced from 200 to 50-120 for a\nfluence of 10^{21} n/cm^{2}, it follows that the inclusion of all high energy\nsources would lead to RRR values well below 50, thus endangering stability and\nprotection.

For the sample nuclei $^{56}$Fe and $^{82}$Ge we perform a\ndetailed analysis of thermal effects on the strength distributions of allowed\nGamow-Teller (GT) transitions which dominate the scattering process at low\nneutrino energies. For $^{56}$Fe and $^{82}$Ge the finite temperature\ncross-sections are calculated by taking into account the contribution of\nallowed and forbidden transitions. The observed enhancement of the\ncross-section at low neutrino energies is explained by considering thermal\neffects on the GT strength. For $^{56}$Fe we compare the calculated\ncross-sections to those obtained earlier from a hybrid approach that combines\nlarge-scale shell-model and RPA calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 12:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-18"}

Given the importance and scope of this problem, the\nmulti-wavelength astronomical community has used the past decade to build up a\nwealth of information over specific extragalactic deep fields to address key\nquestions in galaxy formation and evolution. These fields generally cover at\nleast 10square degrees to facilitate the investigation of the rarest, typically\nmost massive, galaxies and AGN. Furthermore, such areal coverage allows the\nenvironments to be fully accounted for, thereby linking the single halo to the\ntwo-halo terms in the halo occupation distribution. Surveys at radio\nwavelengths have begun to lag behind those at other wavelengths, especially in\nthis medium-deep survey tier. However, the survey speed offered by the JVLA\nmeans that we can now reach a point where we can begin to obtain commensurate\ndata at radio wavelengths to those which already exists from the X-ray through\nto the far-infrared over ~10 square degrees.\n  We therefore present the case for a 10 square degree survey to 1.5uJy at\nL-band in A or B Array, requiring ~4000 hours to provide census of\nstar-formation and AGN-accretion activity in the Universe. For example, the\nobservations will allow galaxies forming stars at 10Msolar/yr to be detected\nout to z~1 and luminous infrared galaxies (1000Msolar/yr to be found out to\nz~6.

Parameter\nand state model reduction for large-scale statistical inverse settings, SIAM J.\nSci. Comput., 32(5):2523-2542, 2010], our approach is based on a generalized\ndata-driven optimization functional in the construction process of the\nsurrogate model and the usage of a trust-region-type solution strategy that\nresults in an additional speed-up of the overall method. In principal, the\nmodel reduction procedure is based on the offline construction of appropriate\nlow-dimensional state and parameter spaces and an online inversion step based\non the resulting surrogate model that is obtained through projection of the\nunderlying control system onto the reduced spaces. The generalization and\nenhancements presented in this work are shown to decrease overall computational\ntime and increase accuracy of the reduced order model and thus allow an\napplication to extreme-scale problems. Numerical experiments for a generic\nmodel and a fMRI connectivity model are presented in order to compare the\ncomputational efficiency of our improved method with the original approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 13:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-22"}

Examining the residuals\nof fits of pulses to such models suggests the following patterns of departure\nfrom smooth pulses: three separate wavelike peaks found in the residuals of\neach pulse (the precursor peak, the central peak, and the decay peak) combine\nwith the underlying Norris et al. (2005) pulse model to produce five distinct\nregions in the temporal evolution of each pulse. The Precursor Shelf occurs\nprior to or concurrent with the exponential Rapid Rise. The pulse reaches\nmaximum intensity at the Peak Plateau, then undergoes a Rapid Decay. The decay\ngradually slows into an Extended Tail. Despite these distinct temporal\nsegments, the pulses studied are almost universally characterized by hard to\nsoft spectral evolution, arguing that the new pulse features reflect a single\nevolution, rather than being artifacts of pulse overlap. The fluctuations can\ngive a single pulse the appearance of having up to three distinct localized\npeaks, leading to ambiguities in pulse-fitting if an incorrect pulse model is\nused. The approach demonstrates that complex GRBs may be composed of fewer\npulses than indicated by the number of peaks. The large degree of similar\nspectro-temporal behavior within gamma-ray burst pulses indicates that a single\nprocess is responsible for producing pulses spanning a tremendous range of\ndurations, luminosities, and spectral hardnesses, and the correlated\ncharacteristics of the wavelike peaks are related to the pulse asymmetry,\nsuggesting kinematic origins that seem supportive of relativistic shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 14:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Such formulation nicely combines the ingredients of\nensemble Kalman filters and variational data assimilation (4DVar). In the same\nway as variational assimilation schemes, it is formulated as the minimization\nof an objective function, but similarly to ensemble filter, it introduces in\nits objective function an empirical ensemble-based background-error covariance\nand works in an off-line smoothing mode rather than sequentially like\nsequential filters. These techniques have the great advantage to avoid the\nintroduction of tangent linear and adjoint models, which are necessary for\nstandard incremental variational techniques. They also allow handling a time\nvarying background covariance matrix representing the error evolution between\nthe estimated solution and a background solution. As this background error\ncovariance matrix -- of reduced rank in practice -- plays a key role in the\nvariational process, our study particularly focuses on the generation of the\nanalysis ensemble state with localization techniques.

We have followed the methods and assumptions of the SNLS 3-year data\nanalysis except for the following important improvements: 1) the addition of\nthe full SDSS-II spectroscopically-confirmed SN Ia sample in both the training\nof the SALT2 light curve model and in the Hubble diagram analysis (\\nsdssc\nSNe), 2) inter-calibration of the SNLS and SDSS surveys and reduced systematic\nuncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with respect to\nthe cosmology analysis, and 3) a thorough investigation of systematic errors\nassociated with the SALT2 modeling of SN Ia light-curves. We produce\nrecalibrated SN Ia light-curves and associated distances for the SDSS-II and\nSNLS samples.

Especially\nthe measure of information transfer, transfer entropy, has seen a dramatic\nsurge of interest in neuroscience. Estimating transfer entropy from two\nprocesses requires the observation of multiple realizations of these processes\nto estimate associated probability density functions. To obtain these\nobservations, available estimators assume stationarity of processes to allow\npooling of observations over time. This assumption however, is a major obstacle\nto the application of these estimators in neuroscience as observed processes\nare often non-stationary. As a solution, Gomez-Herrero and colleagues\ntheoretically showed that the stationarity assumption may be avoided by\nestimating transfer entropy from an ensemble of realizations. Such an ensemble\nis often readily available in neuroscience experiments in the form of\nexperimental trials. Thus, in this work we combine the ensemble method with a\nrecently proposed transfer entropy estimator to make transfer entropy\nestimation applicable to non-stationary time series. We present an efficient\nimplementation of the approach that deals with the increased computational\ndemand of the ensemble method's practical application. In particular, we use a\nmassively parallel implementation for a graphics processing unit to handle the\ncomputationally most heavy aspects of the ensemble method. We test the\nperformance and robustness of our implementation on data from simulated\nstochastic processes and demonstrate the method's applicability to\nmagnetoencephalographic data.

Although these\napproaches have shown promise, several issues related to human language\nbehavior and human-machine conversation have not been addressed. First,\npsycholinguistic studies have shown certain temporal regularities between human\neye movement and language production. While these regularities can potentially\nguide the acquisition process, they have not been incorporated in the previous\nunsupervised approaches. Second, conversational systems generally have an\nexisting knowledge base about the domain and vocabulary. While the existing\nknowledge can potentially help bootstrap and constrain the acquired new words,\nit has not been incorporated in the previous models. Third, eye gaze could\nserve different functions in human-machine conversation. Some gaze streams may\nnot be closely coupled with speech stream, and thus are potentially detrimental\nto word acquisition. Automated recognition of closely-coupled speech-gaze\nstreams based on conversation context is important. To address these issues, we\ndeveloped new approaches that incorporate user language behavior, domain\nknowledge, and conversation context in word acquisition. We evaluated these\napproaches in the context of situated dialogue in a virtual world. Our\nexperimental results have shown that incorporating the above three types of\ncontextual information significantly improves word acquisition performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

Two independent lines of recent research have attempted to\nimprove the mention-pair model, one by acquiring the mention-ranking model to\nrank preceding mentions for a given anaphor, and the other by training the\nentity-mention model to determine whether a preceding cluster is coreferent\nwith a given mention. We propose a cluster-ranking approach to coreference\nresolution, which combines the strengths of the mention-ranking model and the\nentity-mention model, and is therefore theoretically more appealing than both\nof these models. In addition, we seek to improve cluster rankers via two\nextensions: (1) lexicalization and (2) incorporating knowledge of anaphoricity\nby jointly modeling anaphoricity determination and coreference resolution.\nExperimental results on the ACE data sets demonstrate the superior performance\nof cluster rankers to competing approaches as well as the effectiveness of our\ntwo extensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

Vertices in this graph correspond to object parts,\nwhile edges between them model their kinematic relationship. In particular, we\npresent a set of parametric and non-parametric edge models and how they can\nrobustly be estimated from noisy pose observations. We furthermore describe how\nto estimate the kinematic structure and how to use the learned kinematic models\nfor pose prediction and for robotic manipulation tasks. We finally present how\nthe learned models can be generalized to new and previously unseen objects. In\nvarious experiments using real robots with different camera systems as well as\nin simulation, we show that our approach is valid, accurate and efficient.\nFurther, we demonstrate that our approach has a broad set of applications, in\nparticular for the emerging fields of mobile manipulation and service robotics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-02"}

A first KTD-based algorithm is provided\nfor deterministic Markov Decision Processes (MDP) which produces biased\nestimates in the case of stochastic transitions. Than the eXtended KTD\nframework (XKTD), solving stochastic MDP, is described. Convergence is analyzed\nfor special cases for both deterministic and stochastic transitions.
