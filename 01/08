The theme of the MANIAC Challenge 2013 was ``Mobile Data\nOffloading,'' and consisted on developing and comparatively evaluating\nstrategies to offload infrastructure access points via customer ad hoc\nforwarding using handheld devices (e.g., tablets and smartphones). According to\nthe challenge rules, a hop-by-hop bidding contest (or ``auction'') should\ndecide the path of each data packet towards its destination. Consequently, each\nteam should rely on other teams' willingness to forward packets for them in\norder to get their traffic across the network. In this application scenario,\nthe incentive for customers to join the ad hoc network is discounted monthly\nfees, while operators should benefit from decreased infrastructure costs.\nFollowing the rules of MANIAC Challenge 2013, this paper proposes a strategy\nthat is based on the concept of how ``tight'' a node is to successfully deliver\na packet to its destination within a given deadline. This ``tightness'' idea\nrelies on a shortest-path analysis of the underlying network graph, and it is\nused to define three sub-strategies that specify a) how to participate in an\nauction; b) how to announce an auction; and c) how to decide who wins the\nannounced auction. The proposed strategy seeks to minimize network resource\nutilization and to promote cooperative behavior among participant nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 16:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-08"}

An efficient novelty detection algorithm can\nsave the user a great deal of time and resources when browsing through relevant\nyet usually previously-seen content. Most of the recent research on detection\nof novel documents in text streams has been building upon either geometric\ndistances or distributional similarities, with the former typically performing\nbetter but being much slower due to the need of comparing an incoming document\nwith all the previously-seen ones. In this paper, we propose a new approach to\nnovelty detection in text streams. We describe a resource-aware mechanism that\nis able to handle massive text streams such as the ones present today thanks to\nthe burst of social media and the emergence of the Web as the main source of\ninformation. We capitalize on the historical Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)\nthat was known for capturing well term specificity and we show that it can be\nused successfully at the document level as a measure of document novelty. This\nenables us to avoid similarity comparisons with previous documents in the text\nstream, thus scaling better and leading to faster execution times. Moreover, as\nthe collection of documents evolves over time, we use a temporal variant of IDF\nnot only to maintain an efficient representation of what has already been seen\nbut also to decay the document frequencies as the time goes by. We evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed approach on a real-world news articles dataset\ncreated for this task.

Instead of defined purely syntactically, this notion is based on a\ngraph semantics. lambda-letrec-terms are interpreted as first-order term graphs\nso that unfolding equivalence between terms is preserved and reflected through\nbisimilarity of the term graph interpretations. Compactness of the term graphs\ncan then be compared via functional bisimulation.\n  We describe practical and efficient methods for the following two problems:\ntransforming a lambda-letrec-term into a maximally compact form; and deciding\nwhether two lambda-letrec-terms are unfolding-equivalent. The transformation of\na lambda-letrec-term $L$ into maximally compact form $L_0$ proceeds in three\nsteps:\n  (i) translate L into its term graph $G = [[ L ]]$; (ii) compute the maximally\nshared form of $G$ as its bisimulation collapse $G_0$; (iii) read back a\nlambda-letrec-term $L_0$ from the term graph $G_0$ with the property $[[ L_0 ]]\n= G_0$. This guarantees that $L_0$ and $L$ have the same unfolding, and that\n$L_0$ exhibits maximal sharing.\n  The procedure for deciding whether two given lambda-letrec-terms $L_1$ and\n$L_2$ are unfolding-equivalent computes their term graph interpretations $[[\nL_1 ]]$ and $[[ L_2 ]]$, and checks whether these term graphs are bisimilar.\n  For illustration, we also provide a readily usable implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 18:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2014 14:42:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 12:46:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 13:05:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 21:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-04"}

This economic point of view also takes\nplace in the determination of goods and services in wireless networks. Indeed,\nbefore transmitting customer data, a network operator has to lease some\nfrequency range from a spectrum owner and also has to establish agreements with\nelectricity suppliers. The goal of this paper is to compare two pricing\nschemes, namely a power-based and a flat rate, and give a possible explanation\nwhy flat rate pricing schemes are more common than power based pricing ones in\na deregulated wireless market. We suggest a hierarchical game-theoretical model\nof a three level supply chain: the end users, the service provider and the\nspectrum owner. The end users intend to transmit data on a wireless network.\nThe amount of traffic sent by the end users depends on the available frequency\nbandwidth as well as the price they have to pay for their transmission. A\nnatural question arises for the service provider: how to design an efficient\npricing scheme in order to maximize his profit. Moreover he has to take into\naccount the lease charge he has to pay to the spectrum owner and how many\nfrequency bandwidth to rent. The spectrum owner itself also looks for\nmaximizing its profit and has to determine the lease price to the service\nprovider. The equilibrium at each level of our supply chain model are\nestablished and several properties are investigated. In particular, in the case\nof a power-based pricing scheme, the service provider and the spectrum owner\ntend to share the gross provider profit. Whereas, considering the flat rate\npricing scheme, if the end users are going to exploit the network intensively,\nthen the tariffs of the suppliers (spectrum owner and service provider)\nexplode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2014 19:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-08"}

The model has a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry, the\nmatter content is a radiative perfect fluid and the spatial sections have zero\nconstant curvature.

Observing high $p_T$ top final states\nnaturally drives us towards boosted hadronic analyses that can be tackled\nefficiently with jet substructure techniques. In this paper we analyse the\nprospects of constraining exemplary non-standard QCD top interactions in this\nkinematical regime. We correctly include QCD modifications to additional gluon\nemission off the boosted top quark and keep track of the modified top tagging\nefficiencies. We conclude that non-standard top QCD interactions can be\nformidably constrained at the LHC 14 TeV. Experimental systematic uncertainties\nare a major obstacle of the described measurement.

The original formalism describing this self-force relied heavily on\nthe Green function of the linear differential operator that governs\ngravitational perturbations. However, because the global calculation of Green\nfunctions in non-trivial black hole spacetimes has been an open problem until\nrecently, alternative methods were established to calculate self-force effects\nusing sophisticated regularization techniques that avoid the computation of the\nglobal Green function. We present a method for calculating the self-force that\nemploys the global Green function and is therefore closely modeled after the\noriginal self-force expressions.

This novel approach can be used along arbitrary worldlines, including\nthose currently inaccessible to more established computational techniques.\nFurthermore, it yields geometrical insight into the contributions to\nself-interaction from curved geometry (back-scattering) and trapping of null\ngeodesics. We demonstrate the method on the motion of a scalar charge in\nSchwarzschild spacetime.

Cathy should remain\nignorant of all but her own cards after Alice and Bob have made their\nannouncements.

The union of all of those graph classes is the\nclass of circle graphs. The polygon number $\\gp(G)$ of a circle graph $G$ is\nthe minimum $k$ such that $G$ is a $k$-polygon graph.

Tests performed by different research teams\nhave shown that, indeed, the machine seems to exploit quantum effects. However\nexperiments on a class of random-bond instances have not yet demonstrated an\nadvantage over classical optimization algorithms on traditional computer\nhardware. Here we present evidence as to why this might be the case. These\nengineered quantum annealing machines effectively operate coupled to a\ndecohering thermal bath.

We simulate both random-bond Ising\nmodels and spin glasses with bimodal and Gaussian disorder on the D-Wave\nChimera topology. Our results show that while the worst-case complexity of\nfinding a ground state of an Ising spin glass on the Chimera graph is not\npolynomial, the finite-temperature phase space is likely rather simple: Spin\nglasses on Chimera have only a zero-temperature transition. This means that\nbenchmarking optimization methods using spin glasses on the Chimera graph might\nnot be the best benchmark problems to test quantum speedup. We propose\nalternative benchmarks by embedding potentially harder problems on the Chimera\ntopology. Finally, we also study the (reentrant) disorder-temperature phase\ndiagram of the random-bond Ising model on the Chimera graph and show that a\nfinite-temperature ferromagnetic phase is stable up to 19.85(15)%\nantiferromagnetic bonds.

Understanding the\nstructures of images (the prior information) is important for designing,\ntesting, and choosing image processing methods, and good image processing\nmethods are helpful for further uses of the image data, e.g., increasing the\naccuracy of the object reconstruction methods in transmission imaging\napplications. In reflection imaging, the images are usually modeled as\ndiscontinuous functions and even piecewise constant functions. In transmission\nimaging, it was shown very recently in [49] that almost all images are\ncontinuous functions. However, the author in [49] considered only the case of\nparallel beam geometry and used some too strong assumptions in the proof, which\nexclude some common cases such as cylindrical objects. In this paper, we\nconsider more general beam geometries and simplify the assumptions by using\ntotally different techniques. In particular, we will prove that almost all\nimages in transmission imaging with both parallel and divergent beam geometries\n(two most typical beam geometries) are continuous functions, under much weaker\nassumptions than those in [49], which admit almost all practical cases.\nBesides, taking into accounts our analysis, we compare two image processing\nmethods for Poisson noise (which is the most significant noise in transmission\nimaging) removal.

To this end, we determine here the abundance of several\nelements and their ratios in a sample of stars in the clump of Trumpler 20. The\nprimary goal is to measure Trumpler 20 metallicity, so far very poorly\nconstrained, and revise the cluster's fundamental parameters.

Observationally, the nature of the corona is\nuncertain a priori, but a robust determination of the inner disk radius can be\nmade when the disc emissivity index is tightly constrained. When the inner disc\nis well illuminated, the black hole spin can also be determined. Using\nreflection modelling derived from ray tracing, we show that robust\ndetermination of disc truncation requires that the location of the coronal\nsource is quasi-static and at a height and radius less than the truncation\nradius of the disc. Robust spin measurements require that at least part of the\ncorona lies less than about 10 gravitational radii above the black hole in\norder that the innermost regions, including the innermost stable circular\norbit, are well illuminated. The width of the blurring kernel (e.g., the iron\nline) has a strong dependence on coronal height. These limitations may be\nparticularly applicable at low Eddington fractions (e.g. the low/hard state,\nand low-luminosity AGN) where the height of the corona may be relatively large,\nor outflowing, and tied to jet production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 09:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

The typical way to overcome this problem is to impute\nthe missing data. The problem of imputing missing data is complicated by the\nfact that statistical data often have to satisfy certain edit rules and that\nvalues of variables across units sometimes have to sum up to known totals. For\nnumerical data, edit rules are most often formulated as linear restrictions on\nthe variables. For example, for data on enterprises edit rules could be that\nthe profit and costs of an enterprise should sum up to its turnover and that\nthe turnover should be at least zero. The totals of some variables across units\nmay already be known from administrative data (e.g., turnover from a tax\nregister) or estimated from other sources. Standard imputation methods for\nnumerical data as described in the literature generally do not take such edit\nrules and totals into account. In this article we describe algorithms for\nimputing missing numerical data that take edit restrictions into account and\nensure that sums are calibrated to known totals. These algorithms are based on\na sequential regression approach that uses regression predictions to impute the\nvariables one by one. To assess the performance of the imputation methods, a\nsimulation study is carried out as well as an evaluation study based on a real\ndata set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 11:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-09"}

We use images obtained\nwith the VISTA telescope to construct spatially resolved J vs Z-J\ncolour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of NGC 253, a nearly edge-on disk galaxy in\nthe Sculptor group. The very deep photometry, down to J ~ 23.5, and the wide\narea covered allows us to trace the red giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB) stars that belong to the outer disk and the halo of NGC 253, out\nto 50 kpc along the galaxy minor axis. We confirm the existence of an extra\nplanar stellar component of the disk, with a very prominent southern shelf and\na symmetrical feature on the north side. The only additional visible\nsub-structure is an overdensity in the north-west part of the halo at about 28\nkpc from the plane and extending over ~ 20 kpc parallel with the disk of the\ngalaxy. From the stellar count profile along the major axis we measure the\ntransition from the disk to the halo at a radial distance of about 25 kpc,\nwhere a clear break appears in the number density profile. The isodensity\ncontours show that the inner halo is a flattened structure that blends with a\nmore extended, diffuse, rounder outer halo. Such external structure can be\ntraced to the very edge of our image out to 50 kpc from the disk plane. The\nnumber density profile of the stars in the stellar halo follows a power law\nwith index -1.6, as function of radius. The CMD shows a very homogeneous\nstellar population across the whole field; by comparison with theoretical\nisochrones we conclude that the RGB stars are ~ 8 Gyr old or more, while the\nAGB stars trace a population of about 2 x 10^8 Mo, formed from ~ 0.5 to a few\nGyr ago.

A decrease of damping in both layers due to a partial\ncompensation of the angular momentum leakage in each layer was previously\nobserved at the coincidence of the two ferromagnetic resonances. In case of\nnon-zero magnetic coupling, such a dynamic exchange will depend on the mutual\nprecession of the magnetic moments in the layers. A difference in the linewidth\nof the resonance peaks is expected for the acoustic and optical regimes of\nprecession. However, the interlayer coupling hybridizes the resonance responses\nof the layers and therefore can also change their linewidths. The interplay\nbetween the two mechanisms has never been considered before. In the present\nwork, the joint influence of the hybridization and non-local damping on the\nlinewidth has been studied in weakly coupled NiFe/CoFe/Cu/CoFe/MnIr spin-valve\nmultilayers. It has been found that the dynamic exchange by spin currents is\ndifferent in the optical and acoustic modes, and this difference is dependent\non the interlayer coupling strength. In contrast to the acoustic precession\nmode, the dynamic exchange in the optical mode works as an additional damping\nsource. A simulation in the framework of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert formalism\nfor two ferromagnetic layers coupled magnetically and by spin currents has been\ndone to separate the effects of the non-local damping from the resonance modes\nhybridization. In our samples both mechanisms bring about linewidth changes of\nthe same order of magnitude, but lead to a distinctly different angular\nbehavior. The obtained results are relevant for a broad class of coupled\nmagnetic multilayers with ballistic regime of the spin transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 11:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-14"}

Dust growth in the ISM becomes an important dust source in dwarf galaxies,\non the timescale of 0.1 - few Gyrs.

Our models reproduce the relation between the DGR and oxygen\nabundance, derived from observations of a large sample of dwarf galaxies. The\nsteep decrease in the DGR at low O values is explained by the relatively low\nefficiency of dust condensation in stars. The scatter observed at higher O\nvalues is determined mainly by different critical metallicities for the\ntransition from stardust- to ISM-growth dominated dust production, depending on\nthe star formation history. In galaxies with episodic star formation,\nadditional dispersion in the DGR is introduced by grain destruction during\nstarbursts, followed by an increase of the dust mass due to dust growth in the\nISM during post-burst evolution.

The onset of\nquartetting in homgeneous fermionic matter is studied with the help of an\nin-medium modified four fermion equation. It is found that at very low density\nquartetting wins over pairing. At zero temperature, in analogy to pairing, a\nset of equations for the quartet order parameter is given. Contrary to pairing,\nquartetting only exists for strong coupling and breaks down for weak coupling.\nReasons for this finding are detailed. In an application to nuclear matter, the\ncritical temperature for alpha particle condensation can reach values up to\naround 8 MeV. The disappearance of alpha particles with increasing density,\ni.e. the Mott transition, is investigated. In finite nuclei the Hoyle state,\nthat is the second 0+ state of 12C is identified as an 'alpha-particle\ncondensate' state. It is conjectured that such states also exist in heavier\nn-alpha nuclei, like 16O, 20Ne, etc. The sixth 0+ state in 16O is proposed as\nan analogue to the Hoyle state.

Gain matrices allow for the modeling of complex environments,\ne.g., with obstacles and walls. We experimentally evaluate the framework in two\nindoors testbeds with 20 and 60 motes, and confirm superior predictive\nperformance in packet reception rate for a gain matrix model over a geometric\ndistance-based model.\n  At the heart of our approach is a new parameter $\\zeta$ called metricity\nwhich indicates how close the gain matrix is to a distance metric, effectively\nmeasuring the complexity of the environment.

In principle, this\nstate can be reached for any density lower than the one corresponding to one\ncomplete monolayer, which is then the critical density. Below this critical\nvalue, the transition to the absorbing state is of first order, with long\nmetastable periods, followed by rapid transitions driven by homogeneous\nnucleation. Molecular dynamics simulations and experiments show that there is a\ndramatic increase on the metastable times far below the critical density; in\npractice, it is impossible to observe spontaneous transitions close to the\ncritical density. This peculiar feature is a consequence of the non-equilibrium\nnature of this first order transition to the absorbing state. A Ginzburg-Landau\nmodel, with multiplicative noise, describes qualitatively the observed\nphenomena and explains the macroscopic size of the critical nuclei. The nuclei\nbecome of small size only close to a second critical point where the active\nphase becomes unstable via a saddle node bifurcation.

However, to interact with humans or to be incorporated\ninto a human \"collective\" robots have to be provided with some human-like\ncognitive abilities. What does it mean? - nobody knows. But robotics research\ncommunities are trying hard to find out a way to cope with this problem.\nMeanwhile, despite abundant funding these efforts did not lead to any\nmeaningful result (only in Europe, only in the past ten years, Cognitive\nRobotics research funding has reached a ceiling of 1.39 billion euros). In the\nnext ten years, a similar budget is going to be spent to tackle the Cognitive\nRobotics problems in the frame of the Human Brain Project. There is no reason\nto expect that this time the result will be different. I would like to try to\nexplain why I'm so unhappy about this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2014 13:05:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Jul 2014 04:40:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 19 Jul 2014 18:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}
