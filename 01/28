This minrep\nadmits a family of deformations labelled by the spin t of an SU(2)_T group,\nwhich is the 6d analog of helicity in four dimensions. These deformations of\nthe minrep of SO(6,2) describe massless conformal fields that are symmetric\ntensors in the spinorial representation of the 6d Lorentz group. The minrep and\nits deformations were obtained by quantization of the nonlinear realization of\nSO(6,2) as a quasiconformal group in arXiv:1005.3580. We give a novel\nreformulation of the generators of SO(6,2) for these representations as\nbilinears of deformed twistorial oscillators which transform nonlinearly under\nthe Lorentz group SO(5,1) and apply them to define higher spin algebras and\nsuperalgebras in AdS_7. The higher spin (HS) algebra of Fradkin-Vasiliev type\nin AdS_7 is simply the enveloping algebra of SO(6,2) quotiented by a two-sided\nideal (Joseph ideal) which annihilates the minrep. We show that the Joseph\nideal vanishes identically for the quasiconformal realization of the minrep and\nits enveloping algebra leads directly to the HS algebra in AdS_7. Furthermore,\nthe enveloping algebras of the deformations of the minrep define a discrete\ninfinite family of HS algebras in AdS_7 for which certain 6d Lorentz covariant\ndeformations of the Joseph ideal vanish identically. These results extend to\nsuperconformal algebras OSp(8*|2N) and we find a discrete infinite family of HS\nsuperalgebras as enveloping algebras of the minimal unitary supermultiplet and\nits deformations. Our results suggest the existence of a discrete family of\n(supersymmetric) HS theories in AdS_7 which are dual to free (super)conformal\nfield theories (CFTs) or to interacting but integrable (supersymmetric) CFTs in\n6d.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 17:04:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Mar 2014 17:35:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Jun 2014 14:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

With these methods we obtain new\nresults, such as the invariance of the dimension under subanalytic bijection in\nany characteristic.

It provides an\nasymptotic analysis of a Bhattacharya based upper bound on the\nmisclassification probability for the optimal Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP)\nclassifier that depends on quantities that are dual to the concepts of\ndiversity-order and coding gain in multi-antenna communications. The\ndiversity-order of the measurement system determines the rate at which the\nprobability of misclassification decays with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the\nlow-noise regime. The counterpart of coding gain is the measurement gain which\ndetermines the power offset of the probability of misclassification in the\nlow-noise regime. These two quantities make it possible to quantify differences\nin misclassification probability between random measurement and\n(diversity-order) optimized measurement. Results are presented for two-class\nclassification problems first with zero-mean Gaussians then with nonzero-mean\nGaussians, and finally for multiple-class Gaussian classification problems. The\nbehavior of misclassification probability is revealed to be intimately related\nto certain fundamental geometric quantities determined by the measurement\nsystem, the source and their interplay. Numerical results, representative of\ncompressive classification of a mixture of Gaussians, demonstrate alignment of\nthe actual misclassification probability with the Bhattacharya based upper\nbound.

In the framework of the\nCALYPSO (Continuum And Lines in Young ProtoStellar Objects) IRAM Plateau de\nBure survey, we obtained large bandwidth spectra at sub-arcsecond resolution\ntowards NGC 1333-IRAS2A. We identify the emission lines towards the central\nprotostar and perform Gaussian fits to constrain the size of the emitting\nregion for each of these lines, tracing various physical conditions and scales.\nThe emission of numerous COMs such as methanol, ethylene glycol, and methyl\nformate is spatially resolved by our observations. This allows us to measure,\nfor the first time, the size of the COM emission inside the protostellar\nenvelope, finding that it originates from a region of radius 40-100 AU,\ncentered on the NGC 1333-IRAS2A protostellar object. Our analysis shows no\npreferential elongation of the COM emission along the jet axis, and therefore\ndoes not support the hypothesis that COM emission arises from shocked envelope\nmaterial at the base of the jet. Down to similar sizes, the dust continuum\nemission is well reproduced with a single envelope model, and therefore does\nnot favor the hypothesis that COM emission arises from the thermal sublimation\nof grains embedded in a circumstellar disk. Finally, the typical scale $\\sim$60\nAU observed for COM emission is consistent with the size of the inner envelope\nwhere $T_{\\rm{dust}} > 100$ K is expected. Our data therefore strongly suggest\nthat the COM emission traces the hot corino in IRAS2A, i.e., the warm inner\nenvelope material where the icy mantles of dust grains evaporate because they\nare passively heated by the central protostellar object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2014 20:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

Requirement of very little human\nintervention is one of the most desirable features of WSNs, thus making it a\ncheaper and safer alternative for securing large areas such as international\nborders. Jamming attacks in WSNs can be applied to disrupt communications among\nthe sensor nodes in the network. Since it is difficult to prevent jamming\nattacks, detection and mapping out the jammed regions is critical to overcome\nthis problem. In a security monitoring scenario, the network operators will be\nable to take proper measures against jamming once the jammed regions in the\nnetwork are known to them. It is also desirable to keep the interactions of the\nsensor nodes in the network minimal, as they are low powered devices and need\nto conserve their resources.

Given that the bare fine structure constant in graphene is of order\nunity, which is neither small to justify a perturbative expansion nor large\nenough for strong-coupling theories to be applicable, the problem is a\ndifficult one, with some similarity to 2+1-dimensional strong-coupling quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED).

While no direct signatures for non-Fermi liquid\nbehavior at the Dirac point have yet been observed experimentally, there is\nample evidence for the interaction-induced renormalization of the graphene\nvelocity as the carrier density approaches zero. We provide a critical\ncomparison between theory and experiment, using both bare- and\nscreened-interaction (RPA) calculations. We find that while the one-loop RG\nanalysis gives reasonable agreement with the experimental data, especially when\nscreening and finite-density effects are included through the RPA, the two-loop\nanalysis reveals a strong-coupling critical point in suspended graphene,\nsignifying either a quantum phase transition or a breakdown of the\nweak-coupling RG approach.

However, the resulting effect on cosmological perturbations\nis relative to the primordial power spectrum of density perturbations from\ninflation, so freedom in the primordial power spectrum affects neutrino mass\nconstraints. Using measurements of the cosmic microwave background, the galaxy\npower spectrum and the Hubble constant, we constrain neutrino mass and number\nof species for a model independent primordial power spectrum.

Of course difficulties arise if there is a non-$L^1$ element in the\nclass, and the Hadamard finite part integral ({\\em p.f.}) does not apply. Such\nsingular integrals arise naturally in many contexts including PDEs and singular\nODEs.\n  The Lebesgue integral as well as $p.f.$, starting at zero, obey two\nfundamental conditions: (i) they act as antiderivatives and, (ii) if $f =g$ on\n$(0,a)$, then their integrals from $0$ to $x$ coincide for any $x\\in (0,a)$.\n  We find that integrals from zero with the essential properties of $p.f.$,\nplus positivity, exist by virtue of the Axiom of Choice (AC) on all functions\non $(0,1]$ which are $L^1((\\epsilon,1])$ for all $\\epsilon>0$.

Two such spaces are equivalent if\nthey are isometric as metric spaces via an isometry that maps the probability\nmeasure on the first space to the probability measure on the second. The\nresulting set of equivalence classes can be metrized with the Gromov-Prohorov\nmetric of Greven, Pfaffelhuber and Winter.\n  We consider the natural binary operation $\\boxplus$ on this space that takes\ntwo metric measure spaces and forms their Cartesian product equipped with the\nsum of the two metrics and the product of the two probability measures.

In pulmonary artery\nsmooth muscle cells (PASMCs) nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate\n(NAADP) may trigger increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ via L-SR junctions, in a\nmanner that requires initial Ca2+ release from lysosomes and subsequent\nCa2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) via ryanodine receptor (RyR) subtype 3 on the\nSR membrane proximal to lysosomes. L-SR junction membrane separation has been\nestimated to be <400 nm and thus beyond the resolution of light microscopy.\nThis study utilizes transmission electron microscopy to provide a thorough\nultrastructural characterization of the L-SR junctions in PASMCs. These\njunctions are prominent features in these cells and we estimate that the\nmembrane separation and extension are about 15 nm and 300 nm, respectively. We\nalso develop a quantitative model of the L-SR junction using these\nmeasurements, prior kinetic and specific Ca2+ signal information as input data.\nSimulations of NAADP-dependent junctional Ca2+ transients show that the\nmagnitude of these signals can breach the threshold for CICR via RyR3. By\ncorrelation analysis of live cell Ca2+ signals and simulated L-SR junctional\nCa2+ transients, we estimate that \"trigger zones\" with a 60-100 junctions are\nrequired to confer a signal of similar magnitude. This is compatible with the\n130 lysosomes/cell estimated from our ultrastructural observations. Most\nimportantly, our model shows that increasing the L-SR junctional width above 50\nnm lowers the magnitude of junctional [Ca2+] such that there is a failure to\nbreach the threshold for CICR via RyR3. L-SR junctions are therefore a\npre-requisite for efficient Ca2+ signal coupling and may contribute to cellular\nfunction in health and disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 00:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-03"}

Once the association is\nperformed, the exact access probability for a typical sleeping cell user and\nthe statistics of its received signal and interference powers are derived to\nevaluate the spectral and energy efficiencies of transmission. For the sleeping\ncell users, we also consider the conventional \\textbf{M}aximum\n\\textbf{R}eceived \\textbf{S}ignal \\textbf{P}ower (MRSP)-based user association\nscheme along with greedy and round-robin schemes at the BSs. The impact of\ncell-zooming is incorporated in the derivations to analyze its feasibility in\nreducing the coverage holes created by BS sleeping. Numerical results show the\ntrade-offs between spectral efficiency and energy efficiency in various network\nscenarios. The accuracy of the analysis is verified through Monte-Carlo\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 05:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The reason for this difference is that the\ncurvature energy of the LG (HP) Hamiltonian is defined by means of the\ntangential (normal) vector of the surface. For this reason the curvature energy\nof the LG model includes the in-plane bending or shear energy component, which\nis not included in the curvature energy of the HP model. From the simulation\ndata, we find that the LG model undergoes a first-order collapse transition.\nThe results of the LG model in the higher dimensional spaces ${\\bf R}^d (d>3)$\nand on the self-avoiding surfaces in ${\\bf R}^3$ are presented and discussed.\nWe also study the David-Guitter (DG) model, which is a variant of the LG model,\nand find that the DG model undergoes a first-order transition.

Within\nour sample, we can distinguish three groups of stars segregated (though\ncontiguous) in colours: Group 1 (49 stars) is metal-poor, N-normal, Na-poor and\nO-rich with abundances that match those determined for the primordial group of\nRGB stars from previous studies. Group 2 (23 stars) is still metal-poor, but it\nis N- and Na-rich, though only very mildly depleted in O. We can identify this\nintermediate group as the progeny of the metal-poor RGB stars that occupy an\nintermediate location along the Na-O anti-correlation. The third group (20\nstars) is metal-rich, Na-rich, and O-rich and likely corresponds to the most\nO-rich component of the previously found metal-rich RGB population.

However, they do not\nfollow the supergiant sequence in the color-color diagram, neither the\nblackbody nor the main-sequence sequence. Instead, we found that novae evolve\nalong a new sequence in the pre-maximum and near-maximum phases, which we call\n\"the nova-giant sequence.\" This sequence is parallel to but \\Delta (U-B)\n\\approx -0.2 mag bluer than the supergiant sequence. This is because the mass\nof a nova envelope is much (\\sim10^{-4} times) less than that of a normal\nsupergiant.

Then the\ncolor evolves leftward (blueward in B-V but almost constant in U-B), owing\nmainly to the development of strong emission lines. This is the general course\nof nova outbursts in the color-color diagram, which was deduced from eight\nwell-observed novae in various speed classes. For a nova with unknown\nextinction, we can determine a reliable value of the color excess by matching\nthe observed track of the target nova with this general course.

The\ndevelopment of early warning signals is recognized as a major challenge. Recent\nprogress builds on a mathematical framework in which a real-world system is\ndescribed by a low-dimensional equation system with a small number of key\nvariables, where the critical transition often corresponds to a bifurcation.\nHere we show that in high-dimensional systems, containing many variables, we\nfrequently encounter an additional non-bifurcative saddle-type mechanism\nleading to critical transitions. This generic class of transitions has been\nmissed in the search for early-warnings up to now. In fact, the saddle-type\nmechanism also applies to low-dimensional systems with saddle-dynamics. Near a\nsaddle a system moves slowly and the state may be perceived as stable over\nsubstantial time periods. We develop an early warning sign for the saddle-type\ntransition. We illustrate our results in two network models and epidemiological\ndata. This work thus establishes a connection from critical transitions to\nnetworks and an early warning sign for a new type of critical transition. In\ncomplex models and big data we anticipate that saddle-transitions will be\nencountered frequently in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 10:07:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 10:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

The pSI leads to delocalization error\nin the polaron wave function and energy, as calculated from the Kohn-Sham (KS)\npotential in the native charge state of the polaron. This constitutes the\norigin of the systematic failure of DFT to describe polaron formation in band\ninsulators. It is shown that the delocalization error in these systems is,\nhowever, largely absent in the KS potential of the closed-shell neutral charge\nstate. This leads to a modification of the DFT total-energy functional that\ncorrects the pSI in the XC functional. The resulting pSIC-DFT method\nconstitutes an accurate parameter-free {\\it ab initio} methodology for\ncalculating polaron properties in insulators at a computational cost that is\norders of magnitude smaller than hybrid XC functionals. Unlike approaches that\nrely on parametrized localized potentials such as DFT+$U$, the pSIC-DFT method\nproperly captures both site and bond-centered polaron configurations. This is\ndemonstrated by studying formation and migration of self-trapped holes in\nalkali halides (bond-centered) as well as self-trapped electrons in an\nelpasolite compound (site-centered). The pSIC-DFT approach consistently\nreproduces the results obtained by hybrid XC functionals parametrized by\nDFT+$G_0W_0$ calculations. Finally, we generalize the pSIC approach to hybrid\nfunctionals, and show that in stark contrast to conventional hybrid\ncalculations of polaron energies, the pSIC-hybrid method is insensitive to the\nparametrization of the hybrid XC functional. On this basis, we further\nrationalize the success of the pSIC-DFT approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 11:03:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 08:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 21:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

However, many\nprevious studies indicate that the traditional TCP Slow Start algorithm does\nnot perform well, especially in long fat networks. Two obvious problems are\nknown to impact the Slow Start performance, which are the blind initial setting\nof the Slow Start threshold and the aggressive increase of the probing rate\nduring the startup phase regardless of the buffer sizes along the path. Current\nefforts focusing on tuning the Slow Start threshold and/or probing rate during\nthe startup phase have not been considered very effective, which has prompted\nan investigation with a different approach. In this paper, we present a novel\nTCP startup method, called threshold-less slow start or SSthreshless Start,\nwhich does not need the Slow Start threshold to operate. Instead, SSthreshless\nStart uses the backlog status at bottleneck buffer to adaptively adjust probing\nrate which allows better seizing of the available bandwidth. Comparing to the\ntraditional and other major modified startup methods, our simulation results\nshow that SSthreshless Start achieves significant performance improvement\nduring the startup phase. Moreover, SSthreshless Start scales well with a wide\nrange of buffer size, propagation delay and network bandwidth. Besides, it\nshows excellent friendliness when operating simultaneously with the currently\npopular TCP NewReno connections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 11:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-29"}

Two\ncrucial parameters control the micro-physics of these shocks: the magnetization\nof the ambient medium and the Lorentz factor of the shock front; as of today,\nmuch of this parameter space remains to be explored. In the present paper, we\nreport on a new instability upstream of electron-positron relativistic shocks\nand we argue that this instability shapes the micro-physics at moderate\nmagnetization levels and/or large Lorentz factors. This instability is seeded\nby the electric current carried by the accelerated particles in the shock\nprecursor as they gyrate around the background magnetic field. The compensation\ncurrent induced in the background plasma leads to an unstable configuration,\nwith the appearance of charge neutral filaments carrying a current of the same\npolarity, oriented along the perpendicular current. This ``current-driven\nfilamentation'' instability grows faster than any other instability studied so\nfar upstream of relativistic shocks, with a growth rate comparable to the\nplasma frequency. Furthermore, the compensation of the current is associated\nwith a slow-down of the ambient plasma as it penetrates the shock precursor (as\nviewed in the shock rest frame). This slow-down of the plasma implies that the\n``current driven filamentation'' instability can grow for any value of the\nshock Lorentz factor, provided the magnetization \\sigma <~ 10^{-2}. We argue\nthat this instability explains the results of recent particle-in-cell\nsimulations in the mildly magnetized regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 13:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In analogy to\nlight-waves, governed by the same equation, these electrons share many of the\nfundamental traits and dynamics of photons. Today, spatial manipulation of\nelectron beams is achieved mainly using electrostatic and magnetic fields.\nOther demonstrations include simple phase-plates and holographic masks based on\nbinary diffraction gratings. Altering the spatial profile of the beam may be\nproven useful in many fields incorporating phase microscopy, electron\nholography, and electron-matter interactions. These methods, however, are\nfundamentally limited due to energy distribution to undesired diffraction\norders as well as by their binary construction. Here we present a new method in\nelectron-optics for arbitrarily shaping of electron beams, by precisely\ncontrolling an engineered pattern of thicknesses on a thin-membrane, thereby\nmolding the spatial phase of the electron wavefront. Aided by the past decade's\nmonumental leap in nano-fabrication technology and armed with light-optic's\nvast experience and knowledge, one may now spatially manipulate an electron\nbeam's phase in much the same way light waves are shaped simply by passing them\nthrough glass elements such as refractive and diffractive lenses.

This opens exciting new possibilities for microscopic studies of\nmaterials using shaped electron beams and enables electron beam lithography\nwithout the need to move the electron beam or the sample, as well as high\nresolution inspection of electronic chips by structured electron illumination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 13:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

We attribute this dust structure to the\ninteraction of radiation pressure from the star with dust carried along by the\nIC 434 photo-evaporative flow of ionized gas from the dark cloud L1630. We have\ndeveloped a quantitative model for the interaction of a dusty ionized flow with\nnearby (massive) stars where radiation pressure stalls dust, piling it up at an\nappreciable distance (> 0.1 pc), and force it to flow around the star. The\nmodel demonstrates that for the conditions in IC 434, the gas will decouple\nfrom the dust and will keep its original flow lines. We argue that this dust\nstructure is the first example of a dust wave created by a massive star moving\nthrough the interstellar medium. Dust waves (and bow waves) stratify dust\ngrains according to their radiation pressure opacity, which reflects the size\ndistribution and composition of the grain material. Comparison of our model\nwith observations implies that dust-gas coupling through Coulomb interaction is\nless important than previously thought, challenging our understanding of grain\ndynamics in hot, ionized regions of space.

The X-ray image of SN 1006\nreveals an indentation in the southwestern part of the shock front and the HI\nmaps show an isolated cloud (southwestern cloud) having the same velocity as\nthe northwestern cloud and whose morphology fits perfectly in the indentation.\nWe performed spatially resolved spectral analysis of a set of small regions in\nthe southwestern nonthermal limb and studied the deep X-ray spectra obtained\nwithin the XMM-Newton SN 1006 Large Program. We also analyzed archive HI data,\nobtained combining single dish and interferometric observations. We found that\nthe best-fit value of the N_H derived from the X-ray spectra significantly\nincreases in regions corresponding to the southwestern cloud, while the cutoff\nenergy of the synchrotron emission decreases. The amount of the N_H variations\ncorresponds perfectly with the HI column density of the southwestern cloud, as\nmeasured from the radio data. The decrease in the cutoff energy at the\nindentation clearly reveals that the back side of the cloud is actually\ninteracting with the remnant. The southwestern limb therefore presents a unique\ncombination of efficient particle acceleration and high ambient density, thus\nbeing the most promising region for gamma-ray hadronic emission in SN 1006.

A linear stability analysis\nconfirmed that this long wavelength instability (~7H) is due to an\nelasto-capillary effect, the implementation of which required direct\nmeasurements of the surface tension and the elasticity of the gel. The surface\ntension of the gel was estimated from the fundamental spherical harmonic of a\nhemispherical cap of the gel that was excited by an external noise. The shear\nmodulus of the gel was determined from its resonant shear mode in a confined\ngeometry. During the course of this study, it was found that a high density\nsteel ball submerges itself inside the gel by balancing its excess weight with\nthe accumulated strain induced elastic force that allows another estimation of\nits elastic modulus.

This\nis especially true in the case of mobile systems, where multipath propagation\ncauses the received signal to be seriously degraded. Over the years, many\ntechniques have been proposed to combat channel effects. Two of the most\npopular are linear equalisation (LE) and decision feedback equalisation (DFE).\nThese methods offer a good compromise between performance and computational\ncomplexity. LE and DFE are implemented using finite impulse response (FIR)\nfilters whose frequency spectrum approximates the inverse of the channel\nspectrum plus noise. In mobile systems, the equaliser is made adaptable in\norder to be able to respond to the channel variations. Adaptability is achieved\nusing adaptive FIR filters whose coefficients are iteratively updated. In\nprinciple, an infinite number of filter coefficients would be needed to achieve\nperfect channel inversion. In practice, the number of taps must be finite.\nSimulations show that, in realistic scenarios, making the equaliser longer than\na certain (undetermined) number of taps will not yield any benefit. Moreover,\ncomputation and power will be wasted. In battery powered devices, like mobile\nterminals, it would be desirable to have the equaliser properly dimensioned.\nThe equaliser's optimum length strongly depends on the particular scenario, and\nas channel conditions vary, this optimum is likely to vary. This thesis\npresents novel techniques to perform equaliser length adjustment. Methods for\nthe LE and the DFE have been developed. Simulations in many different scenarios\nshow that the proposed schemes optimise the number of taps to be used.\nMoreover, these techniques are able to detect changes in the channel and\nre-adjust the equaliser length appropriately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2014 15:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-29"}

A denser particle submerges itself to a\nconsiderable depth inside the gel and becomes buoyant by balancing its weight\nagainst the elastic force exerted by the surrounding medium. By virtue of a\nlarge elastic-capillary length, the surface of the gel wraps around the\nparticle and closes to create a line singularity connecting the particle to the\nfree surface of the gel. Substantial amount of tensile strain is thus developed\nin the gel network parallel to the free surface that penetrates to a\nsignificant depth inside the gel. The field of this tensile strain is rather\nlong range owing to a large correlation length and strong enough to pull two\nsubmerged particles into contact. The particles move towards each other with an\neffective force following an inverse linear distance law. When more monomers or\ndimers of the particles are released inside the gel, they orient rather freely\ninside the capsules they are in, and attract each other to form close packed\nclusters. Eventually, these clusters themselves interact and coalesce. This is\nan emergent phenomenon in which the gravity, the capillarity and the elasticity\nwork in tandem to create a long range interaction.

However, the evolution of the potential barrier with bombarding\nenergy remains to be confronted with the experimental data.

However,\nwith a minimum of assumptions (isotropic turbulence with a power-law spectrum,\na thermal mix of compressive and solenoidal modes, a critical Bonnor-Ebert\ndensity profile) we can generate initial conditions that match, in a\nstatistical sense, the distributions of mass, projected size and aspect ratio,\nthermal and non-thermal one-dimensional velocity dispersion, observed in\nOphiuchus. The time between core-core collisions in Ophiuchus is sufficiently\nlong, that we can simulate single cores evolving is isolation, and therefore we\nare able to resolve masses well below the opacity limit. We generate an\nensemble of 100 cores, and evolve them with no radiative feedback from the\nstars formed, then with continuous radiative feedback, and finally with\nepisodic radiative feedback. With no feedback the simulations produce too many\nbrown dwarfs, and with continuous feedback too few. With episodic radiative\nfeedback, both the peak of the protostellar mass function (at ~ 0.2 M_sun) and\nthe ratio of H-burning stars to brown dwarfs are consistent with observations.\nThe mass of a star is not strongly related to the mass of the core in which it\nforms.
