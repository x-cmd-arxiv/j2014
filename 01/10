We\nconstruct ratios of the spectra for all observations of a given source with\nrespect to a reference. The reference observation is selected iteratively to be\nthe one with the highest observed continuum. Assuming that any pointing offset\nleads to an overall shift of the continuum level, then these ratios represent\nthe relative flux loss due to mispointing. The mispointing effects are more\npronounced for a smaller beam, so we consider only the FTS short wavelength\narray (SSW, 958-1546 GHz) to derive a pointing correction. We obtain the\nrelative pointing offset by comparing the ratio to a grid of expected losses\nfor a model source at different distances from the centre of the beam, under\nthe assumption that the SSW FTS beam can be well approximated by a Gaussian. In\norder to avoid dependency on the point source flux conversion, which uses a\nparticular observation of Uranus, we use extended source flux calibrated\nspectra to construct the ratios for the SSOs. In order to account for continuum\nvariability, due to the changing distance from the Herschel telescope, the SSO\nratios are normalised by the expected model ratios for the corresponding\nobserving epoch. We confirm the accuracy of the derived pointing offset by\ncomparing the results with a number of control observations, where the actual\npointing of Herschel is known with good precision. Using the method we derived\npointing offsets for repeated observations of Uranus (including observations\ncentred on off-axis detectors), Neptune, Ceres and NGC7027. The results are\nused to validate and improve the point-source flux calibration of the FTS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 16:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-14"}

For 2D simulations of collision\nbetween equal expanding winds, we carry out a parameter study of such\ninstability as a function of the ratio of radiative vs. adiabatic-expansion\ncooling lengths. In the adiabatic regime, the extended cooling layer suppresses\ninstability, leading to planar shock compression with X-ray luminosity that\nfollows closely the expected (Lx ~ M^2) quadratic scaling with mass-loss rate M\n. In the strongly radiative limit, the X-ray emission now follows an expected\nlinear scaling with mass loss (Lx ~ M), but the instability deforms the shock\ncompression into extended shear layers with oblique shocks along fingers of\ncooled, dense material. The spatial dispersion of shock thermalization limits\nstrong X-ray emission to the tips and troughs of the fingers, and so reduces\nthe X-ray emission (here by about a factor 1/50) below what is expected from\nanalytic radiative-shock models without unstable structure. Between these two\nlimits, X-ray emission can switch between a high-state associated with extended\nshock compression, and a low-state characterized by extensive shear. Further\nstudy is needed to clarify the origin of this \"shear mixing reduction factor\"\nin X-ray emission, and its dependence on parameters like the shock Mach number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 16:37:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In the absence of\ninteraction, the influence of particle statistics on the ground-state energy is\ntrivial: the ground-state energy of noninteracting bosons is lower than that of\nfree fermions because of Bose-Einstein condensation and Pauli exclusion\nprinciple. In the presence of hard-core or other interaction, however, the\ncomparison is not trivial. Nevertheless, the ground-state energy of hard-core\nbosons is proved to be lower than that of spinless fermions, if all the hopping\namplitudes are nonnegative. The condition can be understood as the absence of\nfrustration among hoppings. By mapping the many-body Hamiltonian to a\ntight-binding model on a fictitious lattice, we show that the Fermi statistics\nof the original particles introduces an effective magnetic flux in the\nfictitious lattice. The latter can be regarded as a frustration, since it leads\nto a destructive interference among different paths along which a single\nparticle is propagating. If we introduce hopping frustration, the hopping\nfrustration is expected to compete with \"effective frustration\", leading to the\npossibility that the ground-state energy of hard-core bosons can be higher than\nthat of fermions. We present several examples, in which the ground-state energy\nof hard-core bosons is proved to be higher than that of fermions due to the\nhopping frustration.

The appearance of a new time scale\nassociated to the propagation of waves, in addition to the eddy turnover time,\nincreases the complexity of the energy transfers between the various scales;\nnonlinearly interacting waves may dominate at some scales while balanced motion\nmay prevail at others.

Prominence oscillations have been mostly detected using Doppler\nvelocity, although there are also claimed detections by means of periodic\nvariations in half-width or line intensity. However, scarce observational\nevidence exists about simultaneous detection of oscillations in several\nspectral indicators. Aims. Our main aim here is to explore the relationship\nbetween spectral indicators, such as Doppler shift, line intensity, and line\nhalf-width, and the linear perturbations excited in a simple prominence model.\nMethods. Our equilibrium background model consists of a bounded, homogeneous\nslab, which is permeated by a transverse magnetic field, having prominence-like\nphysical properties. Assuming linear perturbations, the dispersion relation for\nfast and slow modes has been derived, as well as the perturbations for the\ndifferent physical quantities. These perturbations have been used as the input\nvariables in a one-dimensional radiative transfer code, which calculates the\nfull spectral profile of the hydrogen H-alpha and H-beta lines. Results. We\nhave found that different oscillatory modes produce spectral indicator\nvariations in different magnitudes. Detectable variations in the Doppler\nvelocity were found for the fundamental slow mode only. Substantial variations\nin the H-beta line intensity were found for specific modes. Other modes lead to\nlower and even undetectable parameter variations. Conclusions. To perform\nprominence seismology, analysis of the H-alpha and H-beta spectral line\nparameters could be a good tool to detect and identify oscillatory modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 19:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

U.S.A. 105, 4972 (2008)], has been used to\nstudy the distinction between deterministic and stochastic components in time\nseries [L. Lacasa and R. Toral, Phys. Rev. E., 82, 036120 (2010)].\nSpecifically, the authors propose that the node degree distribution of these\nprocesses follows an exponential functional of the form $P(\\kappa)\\sim\n\\exp(-\\lambda~\\kappa)$, in which $\\kappa$ is the node degree and $\\lambda$ is a\npositive parameter able to distinguish between deterministic (chaotic) and\nstochastic (uncorrelated and correlated) dynamics. In this work, we investigate\nthe characteristics of the node degree distributions constructed by using HVG,\nfor time series corresponding to $28$ chaotic maps and $3$ different stochastic\nprocesses. We thoroughly study the methodology proposed by Lacasa and Toral\nfinding several cases for which their hypothesis is not valid. We propose a\nmethodology that uses the HVG together with Information Theory quantifiers. An\nextensive and careful analysis of the node degree distributions obtained by\napplying HVG allow us to conclude that the Fisher-Shannon information plane is\na remarkable tool able to graphically represent the different nature,\ndeterministic or stochastic, of the systems under study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 20:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

Traditionally, broadening has been measured with respect to\nthe thrust axis, which is aligned along the (hemisphere) jet momentum to\nminimize the vector sum of transverse momentum within a jet. In this paper, we\nadvocate measuring broadening with respect to the \"broadening axis\", which is\nthe direction that minimizes the scalar sum of transverse momentum within a\njet. This approach eliminates many of the calculational complexities arising\nfrom recoil of the leading parton, and observables like the jet angularities\nbecome recoil-free when measured using the broadening axis. We derive a simple\nfactorization theorem for broadening-axis observables which smoothly\ninterpolates between the thrust-like and broadening-like regimes. We argue that\nthe same factorization theorem holds for two-point energy correlation functions\nas well as for jet shapes based on a \"winner-take-all axis\".

While\ncentralized, highly successful social networking services entail a complete\nprivacy loss of their users, Social Overlays at higher performance represent an\nideal private and censorship-resistant communication substrate for the same\npurpose.\n  Routing in such restricted topologies is facilitated by embedding the social\ngraph into a metric space.

If correct, this confirms long standing predictions\n(Eichler, Livio, Piran and Schramm 1989) that on the one hand, sGRBs are\nproduced in compact binary mergers (CBMs) and on the other hand that these\nevents are significant and possibly dominant sources of the heavy (A>130)\nr-process nuclei.

The\nintroduced conditions are also sufficient for the validity of optimality\nequations, semi-continuity of value functions, and convergence of value\niterations to optimal values. Since POMDPs can be reduced to Completely\nObservable Markov Decision Processes (COMDPs), whose states are posterior state\ndistributions, this paper focuses on the validity of the above mentioned\noptimality properties for COMDPs. The central question is whether transition\nprobabilities for a COMDP are weakly continuous.

The decision making of the entities\nis complicated for two reasons. First, the information is decentralized: the\nISO does not know the aggregators' states (i.e. their energy consumption\nrequests from customers and the amount of energy in their storage), and each\naggregator does not know the other aggregators' states or the ISO's state (i.e.\nthe energy generation costs and the status of the transmission lines). Second,\nthe coupling among the aggregators is unknown to them. Specifically, each\naggregator's energy purchase affects the price, and hence the payments of the\nother aggregators. However, none of them knows how its decision influences the\nprice because the price is determined by the ISO based on its state. We propose\na design framework in which the ISO provides each aggregator with a conjectured\nfuture price, and each aggregator distributively minimizes its own long-term\ncost based on its conjectured price as well as its local information. The\nproposed framework can achieve the social optimum despite being decentralized\nand involving complex coupling among the various entities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2014 22:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-13"}

Large rotationally supported circumstellar disks,\nalthough common around more evolved young stellar objects, are rarely detected\nduring the earliest, \"Class 0\" phase; however, a few excellent candidates have\nbeen discovered recently around both low and high mass protostars. In this\nearly phase, prominent outflows are ubiquitously observed; they are expected to\nbe associated with at least small magnetized disks. Disk formation - once\nthought to be a simple consequence of the conservation of angular momentum\nduring hydrodynamic core collapse - is far more subtle in magnetized gas. In\nthis case, the rotation can be strongly magnetically braked. Indeed, both\nanalytic arguments and numerical simulations have shown that disk formation is\nsuppressed in the strict ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit for the observed\nlevel of core magnetization. We review what is known about this \"magnetic\nbraking catastrophe\", possible ways to resolve it, and the current status of\nearly disk observations. Outflows are also intimately linked to disk formation;\nthey are a natural product of magnetic fields and rotation and are important\nsignposts of star formation.

The properties of early disks and outflows are a key\ncomponent of planet formation in its early stages and we review these major\nconnections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2014 02:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In RC, an input signal perturbs the intrinsic\ndynamics of a medium called a reservoir. A readout layer is then trained to\nreconstruct a target output from the reservoir's state. The multitude of RC\narchitectures and evaluation metrics poses a challenge to both practitioners\nand theorists who study the task-solving performance and computational power of\nRC. In addition, in contrast to traditional computation models, the reservoir\nis a dynamical system in which computation and memory are inseparable, and\ntherefore hard to analyze. Here, we compare echo state networks (ESN), a\npopular RC architecture, with tapped-delay lines (DL) and nonlinear\nautoregressive exogenous (NARX) networks, which we use to model systems with\nlimited computation and limited memory respectively. We compare the performance\nof the three systems while computing three common benchmark time series:\nH{\\'e}non Map, NARMA10, and NARMA20.

Using a biophysically based model, we\ndemonstrate here that the typical absence seizure activities can be controlled\nand modulated by the direct GABAergic projections from the substantia nigra\npars reticulata (SNr) to either the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) or the\nspecific relay nuclei (SRN) of thalamus, through different biophysical\nmechanisms.

More importantly, due to the\ncompetition between the inhibitory SNr-TRN and SNr-SRN pathways, we find that\nboth decreasing and increasing the activation of SNr neurons from the normal\nlevel may considerably suppress the generation of SWDs in the coexistence\nregion. Overall, these results highlight the bidirectional functional roles of\nbasal ganglia in controlling and modulating absence seizures, and might provide\nnovel insights into the therapeutic treatments of this brain disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2014 05:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

It is known that for this\ngeneralization there is no higher dimensional analogue of the lower bound of\nthe Cheeger inequality.

The aim of this study was to examine lip muscle activity during\nAVHs in schizophrenia patients, in order to check whether inner speech\noccurred.

In\nthis work we determine the numerical value of k_1 and compare the expansion to\nthe Monte Carlo data. The calculation of k_1 involves an auxiliary planar\ncellular structure composed of circular arcs, that we will call the\nPoisson-Moebius diagram. It is a special case of more general Moebius diagrams\n(or multiplicatively weighted power diagrams) and is of interest for its own\nsake. We obtain exact results for the total edge length per unit area, which is\na prerequisite for the coefficient k_1, and a few other quantities in this\ndiagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2014 15:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

A sample of 47 low v sin i\nA0-A1 stars (v sin i < 65km/s), initially selected as main-sequence normal\nstars, are investigated with high-resolution and high signal-to-noise\nspectroscopic data.

A detailed abundance analysis and spectral synthesis is performed to\nderive abundances for 14 chemical species.
