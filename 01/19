Simply put, the noise in the\ntunnelling current does not simply add up the equilibrium noise of the edge\ncurrent. A correction term arises associated with the correlation between the\ntunnelling current and the edge current. We show, using a non-equilibrium Ward\nidentity, that this correction term is determined by the anti-symmetric part of\nthe noise in the tunnelling current. This leads to a non-equilibrium\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem and related expressions for the excess and shot\nnoise of the noise in the edge current.

Using both labeled and unlabeled sets to train\nsample classifiers, have not been previously considered when gene and miRNA\nexpression sets are used. Moreover, there is a motivation to integrate both\nmiRNA and gene expression for a semi-supervised cancer classification as that\nprovides more information on the characteristics of cancer samples. In this\npaper, two semi-supervised machine learning approaches, namely self-learning\nand co-training, are adapted to enhance the quality of cancer sample\nclassification. These approaches exploit the huge public corpuses to enrich the\ntraining data. In self-learning, miRNA and gene based classifiers are enhanced\nindependently. While in co-training, both miRNA and gene expression profiles\nare used simultaneously to provide different views of cancer samples. To our\nknowledge, it is the first attempt to apply these learning approaches to cancer\nclassification. The approaches were evaluated using breast cancer,\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and lung cancer expression sets. Results show up\nto 20% improvement in F1-measure over Random Forests and SVM classifiers.\nCo-Training also outperforms Low Density Separation (LDS) approach by around\n25% improvement in F1-measure in breast cancer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2014 21:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}

In particular, we\npresent a new notion of unfounded set for LPAma programs, which is a sound\ngeneralization of the original definition for standard (aggregate-free) LP. On\nthis basis, we define a well-founded operator for LPAma programs, the fixpoint\nof which is called well-founded model (or well-founded semantics) for LPAma\nprograms. The most important properties of unfounded sets and the well-founded\nsemantics for standard LP are retained by this generalization, notably\nexistence and uniqueness of the well-founded model, together with a strong\nrelationship to the answer set semantics for LPAma programs. We show that one\nof the D-well-founded semantics, defined by Pelov, Denecker, and Bruynooghe for\na broader class of aggregates using approximating operators, coincides with the\nwell-founded model as defined in this work on LPAma programs. We also discuss\nsome complexity issues, most importantly we give a formal proof of tractable\ncomputation of the well-founded model for LPA programs.

As a consequence, a\nwell-founded semantics for general LPA programs that allows for tractable\ncomputation is unlikely to exist, which justifies the restriction on LPAma\nprograms. Finally, we present a prototype system extending DLV, which supports\nthe well-founded semantics for LPAma programs, at the time of writing the only\nimplemented system that does so.

We investigate efficient representation scheme and\nalgorithms to bring the benefits of the consistency techniques to also high\narity cost functions, which are often derived from hard global constraints from\nclassical constraint satisfaction. The literature suggests some global cost\nfunctions can be represented as flow networks, and the minimum cost flow\nalgorithm can be used to compute the minimum costs of such networks in\npolynomial time. We show that naive adoption of this flow-based algorithmic\nmethod for global cost functions can result in a stronger form of null-inverse\nconsistency. We further show how the method can be modified to handle cost\nprojections and extensions to maintain generalized versions of AC* and FDAC*\nfor cost functions with more than two variables. Similar generalization for the\nstronger EDAC* is less straightforward. We reveal the oscillation problem when\nenforcing EDAC* on cost functions sharing more than one variable. To avoid\noscillation, we propose a weak version of EDAC* and generalize it to weak\nEDGAC* for non-binary cost functions. Using various benchmarks involving the\nsoft variants of hard global constraints ALLDIFFERENT, GCC, SAME, and REGULAR,\nempirical results demonstrate that our proposal gives improvements of up to an\norder of magnitude when compared with the traditional constraint optimization\napproach, both in terms of time and pruning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2014 21:10:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}

We give new upper bound on the capacity of such channel --\nthe tightness of this upper bound remains an open question. The main component\nof our proof is the careful examination of error-correcting properties of a\ncode with skewed distance distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2014 08:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}

We investigate a current plausible location of an SMBH wandering in\nthe halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). According to theoretical studies of\n$N$-body simulations, some of the many substructures in the M31 halo are\nremnants of a minor merger occurring about 1 Gyr ago.

For the optimal choice of $S_{th}$, we show\nthat FFR gives a higher rate than FR$1$ and a better coverage probability than\nFR$3$. The impact of frequency correlation over the sub-bands allocated to the\nFR$1$ and FR$3$ regions is analysed, and it is shown that correlation decreases\nthe average rate of the FFR network. Numerical results are provided, and these\nmatch with the analytical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2014 12:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-21"}

Both text analysis and control strategies are\nlearned jointly using only a feedback signal inherent to the application. To\neffectively leverage textual information, our method automatically extracts the\ntext segment most relevant to the current game state, and labels it with a\ntask-centric predicate structure.

For example, a bitext can be seen as a sequence of biwords\n---pairs of parallel words with a high probability of co-occurrence--- that can\nbe used as an intermediate representation in the compression process. However,\nthe simple biword approach described in the literature can only exploit\none-to-one word alignments and cannot tackle the reordering of words. We\ntherefore introduce a generalization of biwords which can describe multi-word\nexpressions and reorderings. We also describe some methods for the binary\ncompression of generalized biword sequences, and compare their performance when\ndifferent schemes are applied to the extraction of the biword sequence.

In\nthis paper we present Cycles and Quasi-Cycles (CQC), a novel algorithm for the\nautomated disambiguation of ambiguous translations in the lexical entries of a\nbilingual machine-readable dictionary. The dictionary is represented as a\ngraph, and cyclic patterns are sought in the graph to assign an appropriate\nsense tag to each translation in a lexical entry.
