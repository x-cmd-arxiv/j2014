We ask whether the explicit construction of a theory that\nallows causality violation might in turn teach us something about quantum\ngravity. Taking the toy model of Deutsch as a starting point, in Part I we\nargue that, despite being a nonlinear modification of quantum mechanics, the\nmodel does not imply superluminal signalling and its predictions can be\noperationally verified by experimenters within an appropriate ontological\nsetting. In Part II we show that the model can be directly applied to scalar\nquantum fields, provided the fields are sent back in time by an amount much\nlarger than the coherence time of the wavepackets. We propose a generalisation\nof the model that lifts this constraint and recovers the predictions of\nstandard quantum field theory when the size of the temporal jump is much\nsmaller than the coherence time of the wavepackets. Finally, we discuss an\nextension of the model to ordinary gravitational time dilation.

When it\ncomes to 3D, coming up with a deployment of sensors that gurantees $k$-coverage\nbecomes much more complicated than in 2D.

Recently we developed the methodology of using (dense)\nCompressed Counting for recovering nonnegative K-sparse signals. In this paper,\nwe adopt very sparse Compressed Counting for nonnegative signal recovery. Our\ndesign matrix is sampled from a maximally-skewed p-stable distribution (0<p<1),\nand we sparsify the design matrix so that on average (1-g)-fraction of the\nentries become zero. The idea is related to very sparse stable random\nprojections (Li et al 2006 and Li 2007), the prior work for estimating summary\nstatistics of the data.\n  In our theoretical analysis, we show that, when p->0, it suffices to use M=\nK/(1-exp(-gK) log N measurements, so that all coordinates can be recovered in\none scan of the coordinates. If g = 1 (i.e., dense design), then M = K log N.\nIf g= 1/K or 2/K (i.e., very sparse design), then M = 1.58K log N or M = 1.16K\nlog N. This means the design matrix can be indeed very sparse at only a minor\ninflation of the sample complexity.\n  Interestingly, as p->1, the required number of measurements is essentially M\n= 2.7K log N, provided g= 1/K. It turns out that this result is a general\nworst-case bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2013 18:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-03"}

Moreover, if\nProxima has a planetary system, the planets may be detectable through their\nadditional microlensing signals, although the probability of such detections is\nsmall. With astrometric accuracies of 0.03 mas (achievable with HST spatial\nscanning), centroid shifts caused by Jovian planets are detectable at\nseparations of up to 2.0\" (corresponding to 2.6 AU at the distance of Proxima),\nand centroid shifts by Earth-mass planets are detectable within a small band of\n8 mas (corresponding to 0.01 AU) around the source trajectories. Jovian planets\nwithin a band of about 28 mas (corresponding to 0.036 AU) around the source\ntrajectories would produce a brightening of the source by >0.01 mag and could\nhence be detectable. Estimated timescales of the astrometric and photometric\nmicrolensing events due to a planet range from a few hours to a few days, and\nboth methods would provide direct measurements of the planetary mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2014 01:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

However, to date the\nshortest attosecond (as) pulses have been produced only in the extreme\nultraviolet (EUV) region of the spectrum below 100 eV, which limits the range\nof materials and molecular systems that can be explored. Here we use advanced\nexperiment and theory to demonstrate a remarkable convergence of physics: when\nmid-infrared lasers are used to drive the high harmonic generation process, the\nconditions for optimal bright soft X-ray generation naturally coincide with the\ngeneration of isolated attosecond pulses. The temporal window over which phase\nmatching occurs shrinks rapidly with increasing driving laser wavelength, to\nthe extent that bright isolated attosecond pulses are the norm for 2 \\mu m\ndriving lasers. Harnessing this realization, we demonstrate the generation of\nisolated soft X-ray attosecond pulses at photon energies up to 180 eV for the\nfirst time, that emerge as linearly chirped 300 as pulses with a transform\nlimit of 35 as. Most surprisingly, we find that in contrast to as pulse\ngeneration in the EUV, long-duration, multi-cycle, driving laser pulses are\nrequired to generate isolated soft X-ray bursts efficiently, to mitigate group\nvelocity walk-off between the laser and the X-ray fields that otherwise limit\nthe conversion efficiency. Our work demonstrates a clear and straightforward\napproach for robustly generating bright attosecond pulses of electromagnetic\nradiation throughout the soft X ray region of the spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2014 01:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

We start our review by showing how the generation, transmission\nand distribution characteristics of the traditional power grids are already\nsubject to complex behaviour appearing as a result of the the interplay between\ndynamics of the nodes and topology, namely synchronisation and cascade effects.\nWhen dealing with smart grids, the system complexity increases even more: on\ntop of the physical network of power lines and controllable sources of\nelectricity, the modernisation brings information networks, renewable\nintermittent generation, market liberalisation, prosumers, among other aspects.\nIn this case, we forecast a dynamical co-evolution of the smart grid and other\nkind of networked systems that cannot be understood isolated. This review\ncompiles recent results that model electric power grids as complex systems,\ngoing beyond pure technological aspects.

In this paper we generalize the study of R\\'enyi\nentanglement entropy in pure AdS$_3$ gravity to the massive gravity theories at\nthe critical points.

The overall spin Hamiltonian is comprised of three terms: the\nbackground \\emph{in vacuo} Hamiltonian of the \"Generalized Model of Polypeptide\nChain\" type and two additive terms that account for the two above mechanisms of\nsolvent action.

Observationally, anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft\ngamma-ray repeaters are believed to be magnetar candidates. While more and more\nmultiwave observations of magnetars are available, unfortunately, we see\naccumulating failed predictions of the traditional magnetar model. These\nchallenges urge rethinking of magnetar. Wind braking of magnetars is one of the\nalternative modelings. The release of magnetic energy may generate a particle\noutflow (i.e., particle wind), that results in both an anomalous X-ray\nluminosity and significantly high spindown rate. In this wind braking scenario,\nonly strong multipole field is necessary for a magnetar (a strong dipole field\nis no longer needed). Wind braking of magnetars may help us to understand their\nmultiwave radiation properties, including (1) Non-detection of magnetars in\nFermi-LAT observations, (2) The timing behaviors of low magnetic field\nmagnetars, (3) The nature of anti-glitches, (4) The criterion for magnetar's\nradio emission, etc. In the wind braking model of magentars, timing events of\nmagnetars should always be accompanied by radiative events. It is worth noting\nthat the wind engine should be the central point in the research since other\nefforts with any reasonable energy mechanism may also reproduce the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2014 13:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Close to a critical point, the\nnew EOS expresses the square of the strong scaling field $\\Sigma$ as an\nexplicit function $\\Sigma^2=D^{2e_{-1}}\\Gamma(D^{-e_0}\\Theta)$ of the thermal\nscaling field $\\Theta$ and the dependent scaling field $D>0$, with a smooth,\nuniversal function $\\Gamma$ and the universal exponents\n$e_{-1}=\\delta/(\\delta+1)$, $e_0=1/(2-\\alpha)$.

It was interesting to investigate the behavior of this\ndischarge geometry in a stronger magnetic bottle-shaped field. So a new test\nbench for DUHOCAMIS with a high magnetic bottle-shaped field up to 0.6 T has\nbeen set up at Peking University, on which have been made primary experiments\nin connection with discharge characteristics of the source. The experiments\nwith magnetic fields from 0.13 T to 0.52 T have shown that the magnetic flux\ndensities are very sensitive to the discharge behavior: discharge curves and\nion spectra. It has been found that the slope of discharge curves in a very\nwide range can be controlled by changing the magnetic field as well as\nregulated by adjusting cathode heating power. On the other hand, by comparison\nof discharge curves between dual hollow cathode discharge (DHCD) mode and PIG\ndischarge mode, it was found a much stronger magnetic effect occurred on DHCD\nmode. In this paper, the new test bench with ion source structure is described\nin detail; and main experimental results are presented and discussed, including\nthe effects of cathode heating power and magnetic flux density on discharge\ncharacteristics, also the ion spectra. The effects of the magnetic field on the\nsource operating are emphasized, and a unique behavior of the DUHOCAMIS\noperating in the high magnetic field is expected and discussed especially.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2014 05:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}
