Nevertheless, mass loss on the RGB\nis still often parameterised by a simple Reimers law in stellar evolution\nmodels. Aims: To try to detect CO thermal emission in a small sample of nearby\nRGB stars with reliable Hipparcos parallaxes that were shown to have infrared\nexcess in an earlier paper. Methods: A sample of five stars was observed in the\nCO J=2-1 and J=3-2 lines with the IRAM and APEX telescopes. Results: One star,\nthe one with the largest mass-loss rate based on the previous analysis of the\nspectral energy distribution, was detected. The expansion velocity is\nunexpectedly large at 12 km/s. The line profile and intensity are compared to\nthe predictions from a molecular line emission code. The standard model\npredicts a double-peaked profile, while the observations indicate a flatter\nprofile. A model that does fit the data has a much smaller CO envelope (by a\nfactor of 3), and a CO abundance that is two times larger and/or a larger\nmass-loss rate than the standard model. This could indicate that the phase of\nlarge mass loss has only recently started. Conclusions: The detection of CO in\nan RGB star with a luminosity of only about 1300 solar luminosities and a\nmass-loss rate as low as a few 10(-9) solarmasses/yr is important and the\nresults also raise new questions. However, ALMA observations are required in\norder to study the mass-loss process of RGB stars in more detail, both for\nreasons of sensitivity (6 hours of integration in superior weather at IRAM were\nneeded to get a 4sigma detection in the object with the largest detection\nprobability), and spatial resolution (to determine the size of the CO\nenvelope).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2014 16:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We detected this nova\nas part of the near daily iPTF monitoring of M31 to a depth of $R\\approx\n21$\\,mag and triggered optical photometry, spectroscopy and soft X-ray\nmonitoring of the outburst. Peaking at an absolute magnitude of $M_R=-6.6$ mag,\nand with a decay time of 1 mag per day, it is a faint and very fast nova. It\nshows optical emission lines of He/N and expansion velocities of 1900 to 2600\nkm s$^{-1}$ 1--4 days after the optical peak. The {\\it Swift} monitoring of the\nX-ray evolution revealed a supersoft source (SSS) with $kT_{\\rm eff}\\approx\n90-110\\ {\\rm eV}$ that appeared within 5 days after the optical peak, and\nlasted only 12 days.

Thus, the automatic negotiation of\nService Level Agreements (SLAs) between consumers and providers is key for\nenabling service-based value chains.\n  The process of finding appropriate providers for web services seems to be\nsimple. Consumers contact several providers and take the provider which offers\nthe best matching SLA. However, currently consumers are not able forecasting\nthe probability of finding a matching provider for their requested SLA. So\nconsumers contact several providers and check if their offers are matching. In\ncase of continuing faults, on the one hand consumers may adapt their Service\nLevel Objects (SLOs) of the required SLA or on the other hand simply accept\noffered SLAs of the contacted providers.\n  By forecasting the probability of finding a matching provider, consumers\ncould assess their chances of finding a provider offering the requested SLA. If\na low probability is predicted, consumers can immediately adapt their SLOs or\nincrease the numbers of providers to be contacted.\n  Thus, this paper proposes an analytical forecast model, which allows\nconsumers to get a realistic assessment of the probability to find matching\nproviders. Additionally, we present an optimization algorithm based on the\nforecast results, which allows adapting the SLO parameter ranges in order to\nfind at least one matching provider. Not only consumers, but also providers can\nuse this forecast model to predict the prospective demand. So providers are\nable to assess the number of potential consumers based on their offers too.\n  Justification of our approach is done by simulation of practical examples\nchecking our theoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2014 20:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-13"}

In addition, at times away from equinox, a\nnorth-south asymmetry is expected where the magnetopause will be further\nconfined in one hemisphere but less confined in the opposite hemisphere.\nExamining the extent of this confinement has been limited by a lack of\nhigh-latitude spacecraft observations. Here, for the first time, direct\nevidence for polar confinement of Saturn's magnetopause has been observed using\nin-situ data obtained by the Cassini spacecraft during a series of\nhigh-inclination orbits between 2007 and 2009. Following techniques established\nby previous authors, we assume an equilibrium between the solar wind dynamic\npressure (which Cassini is generally unable to measure directly), and the\nmagnetic plus plasma pressure inside the magnetosphere. This assumption thus\nallows us to estimate the upstream solar wind dynamic pressure ($D_P$) for a\nseries of magnetopause crossings, and hence to determine the expected location\nand global shape of the magnetopause as a function of $D_P$. A clear divergence\nfrom the familiar axisymmetric models of the magnetosphere is observed which\nmay be characterised by an 'apparent flattening parameter' of 0.81+0.03/-0.06\n(representing a simple dilation of the nominal axisymmetric boundary along the\n$Z_{KSM}$ axis such that the extent is reduced by 19% in this direction).

Quantitative models for conversion of kerogen into oil and gas and\nthe timing of hydrocarbon generation have been well documented. However, lack\nof consensus about the kinetics of hydrocarbon formation in source rocks,\nexpulsion timing and how the resulting hydrocarbons escape from or are retained\nin the source rocks motivates further investigation. In particular, many\nmechanisms for the transport of hydrocarbons from the source rocks in which\nthey are generated into adjacent rocks with higher permeabilities and smaller\ncapillary entry pressures have been proposed, and a better understanding of\nthis complex process (primary migration) is needed. To characterize these\nprocesses it is imperative to use the latest technological advances. In this\nstudy, it is shown how insights into hydrocarbon migration in source rocks can\nbe obtained by using sequential high resolution synchrotron X-ray tomography.\nThree-dimensional (3D) images of several immature \"shale\" samples were\nconstructed at resolutions close to 5 micrometers. This is sufficient to\nresolve the source rock structure down to the grain level, but very fine\ngrained silt particles, clay particles and colloids cannot be resolved. Samples\nused in this investigation came from the R-8 unit in the upper part of the\nGreen River Shale, which is organic rich, varved, lacustrine marl formed in\nEocene Lake Uinta, United States of America. One Green River Shale sample was\nheated in-situ up to 400{\\deg}C as X-ray tomography images were recorded. The\nother samples were scanned before and after heating at 400{\\deg}C. During the\nheating phase, the organic matter was decomposed, and gas was released. Gas\nexpulsion from the low permeability shales was coupled with formation of\nmicrocracks. The main technical difficulty was numerical extraction of\nmicrocracks that have apertures in the 5 to 30 micrometer range (with 5\nmicrometers being the resolution limit) from a large 3D volume of X-ray\nattenuation data. The main goal of the work presented here is to develop a\nmethodology to process these 3D data and image the cracks. This methodology is\nbased on several levels of spatial filtering and automatic recognition of\nconnected domains. Supportive petrographic and thermogravimetric data were an\nimportant complement to this study. An investigation of the strain field using\ntwo-dimensional image correlation analyses was also performed. As one\napplication of the four-dimensional (4D, space + time) microtomography and the\ndeveloped workflow, we show that fluid generation was accompanied by crack\nformation. Under different conditions, in the subsurface, this might provide\npaths for primary migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2014 20:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-13"}

This approach also shows that all regimes require a\ncoincidence of time scales and this in turn translates to a certain tuning of\nthe parameters, whether in mass terms or Yukawa couplings. Indeed, we show that\nthe amount of tuning involved in the minimal model is never less than one part\nin 10^5. Finally, we explore an extended model where the tuning can be removed\nin exchange for the introduction of a new degree of freedom in the form of a\nleptophilic Higgs with a vacuum expectation value of the order of GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2014 21:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 23:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

These characteristics\nare realized via several constitutive elements. First, acceleration is employed\nas a feature identifier following Goto and Vassilicos (2006), thus ensuring\nGalilean invariance. Second, the acceleration magnitude is used as basis for a\nmathematically well-developed scalar field topology. The minima of this field\nare called acceleration feature points, a superset of the acceleration zeros.\nThese points are discriminated into vortices and saddle points depending the\nspectral properties of the velocity Jacobian. Third, all operations are based\non discrete topology for the scalar field with combinatorial algorithms. This\nparameter-free foundation allows (1) to use persistence as a physically\nmeaningful importance measure to prioritize feature points, (2) ensures\nrobustness since no differentiation and interpolation need to be performed with\nthe data, and (3) enables a natural and robust tracking algorithm for the\ntemporal feature evolution. In particular, we can track vortex merging events\nin an unsupervised manner.

Wavelength, photon spin angular momentum (PSAM), and photon orbital\nangular momentum (POAM), completely describe the state of a photon or an\nelectric field (an ensemble of photons). Wavelength relates directly to energy\nand linear momentum, the corresponding kinetic quantities. PSAMand POAM,\nthemselves kinetic quantities, are colloquially known as polarization and\noptical vortices, respectively. Astrophysical sources emit photons that carry\nthis information. Aims. PSAM characteristics of an electric field (intensity)\nare compactly described by the Jones (Stokes/Mueller) calculus. Similarly, I\ncreated calculi to represent POAM characteristics of electric fields and\nintensities in an astrophysical context. Adding wavelength dependence to all of\nthese calculi is trivial. The next logical steps are to 1) form photon total\nangular momentum (PTAM = POAM + PSAM) calculi; 2) prove their validity using\noperators and expectation values; and 3) show that instrumental PSAM can affect\nmeasured POAM values for certain types electric fields. Methods. I derive the\nPTAM calculi of electric fields and intensities by combining the POAM and PSAM\ncalculi. I show how these quantities propagate from celestial sphere to image\nplane.

In this vein, coordinatewise methods, the most common means of\ncomputing the lasso solution, work well in the presence of low to moderate\nmulticollinearity. The computational speed of coordinatewise algorithms\ndegrades however as sparsity decreases and multicollinearity increases.\nMotivated by these limitations, we propose the novel \"Deterministic Bayesian\nLasso\" algorithm for computing the lasso solution. This algorithm is developed\nby considering a limiting version of the Bayesian lasso. The performance of the\nDeterministic Bayesian Lasso improves as sparsity decreases and\nmulticollinearity increases, and can offer substantial increases in\ncomputational speed. A rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates that (1) the\nDeterministic Bayesian Lasso algorithm converges to the lasso solution, and (2)\nit leads to a representation of the lasso estimator which shows how it achieves\nboth $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ types of shrinkage simultaneously.

We find\nthat synchronization of two spatially separated clocks can not be precisely\nrealized at quantum level.

Based on the velocity distribution of ESCs,\nwe have determined the total mass and the mass-to-light ratio of NGC 6822:\n$M_{N6822} = 7.5^{+4.5}_{-0.1} \\times 10^{9} M_{\\odot}$ and $(M/L)_{N6822} =\n75^{+45}_{-1} (M/L)_{\\odot}$.

This process has previously been analysed and in this work we extend\nthose analyses by considering the effects of quantum statistics on the dynamics\nand entanglement properties of the condensate modes in the two relevant wells.\nIn order to do this, we go beyond the mean-field analysis of the\nGross-Pitaevskii type approach and utilise the phase-space stochastic methods\nso well known in quantum optics. In particular, we use the exact positive-P\nrepresentation where it is suitable, and the approximate truncated WIgner\nrepresentation otherwise. We find strong agreement between the results of these\ntwo methods, with the mean-field dynamics not depending on the initial quantum\nstates of the trapped condensate. We find that the entanglement properties do\ndepend strongly on the initial quantum states, with quantitatively different\nresults found for coherent and Fock states.
