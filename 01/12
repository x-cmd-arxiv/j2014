Main\npart of these efforts is the study of correlation-based hierarchical networks.\nThis is somewhat surprising as the underlying assumptions of research looking\nat financial markets is that they behave chaotically. In fact it's common for\neconophysicists to estimate maximal Lyapunov exponent for log returns of a\ngiven financial asset to confirm that prices behave chaotically. Chaotic\nbehaviour is only displayed by dynamical systems which are either non-linear or\ninfinite-dimensional. Therefore it seems that non-linearity is an important\npart of financial markets, which is proved by numerous studies confirming\nfinancial markets display significant non-linear behaviour, yet network theory\nis used to study them using almost exclusively correlations and partial\ncorrelations, which are inherently dealing with linear dependencies only. In\nthis paper we introduce a way to incorporate non-linear dynamics and\ndependencies into hierarchical networks to study financial markets using mutual\ninformation and its dynamical extension: the mutual information rate. We\nestimate it using multidimensional Lempel-Ziv complexity and then convert it\ninto an Euclidean metric in order to find appropriate topological structure of\nnetworks modelling financial markets.

Constraints from numerous studies indicate\nthat the observed gamma-ray emission results primarily from hadronic processes,\nproviding direct evidence of highly relativistic ions that have been\naccelerated by the SNR. Here we present an investigation of the dynamical and\nspectral evolution of Tycho's SNR by carrying out hydrodynamical simulations\nthat include diffusive shock acceleration of particles in the amplified\nmagnetic field at the forward shock of the SNR. Our simulations provide a\nconsistent view of the shock positions, the nonthermal emission, the thermal\nX-ray emission from the forward shock, and the brightness profiles of the radio\nand X-ray emission. We compare these with the observed properties of Tycho to\ndetermine the density of the ambient material, the particle acceleration\nefficiency and maximum energy, the accelerated electron to-proton ratio, and\nthe properties of the shocked gas downstream of the expanding SNR shell. We\nfind that evolution of a typical Type Ia supernova in a low ambient density\n(n_0 ~ 0.3 cm^{-3}), with an upstream magnetic field of ~5\\ microGauss, and\nwith ~16% of the SNR kinetic energy being converted into relativistic electrons\nand ions through diffusive shock acceleration, reproduces the observed\nproperties of Tycho.

As a typical pair of\nelements contributes one sum and two differences, we expect that $|A-A| >\n|A+A|$ for a finite set $A$. However, in 2006 Martin and O'Bryant showed that a\npositive proportion of subsets of $\\{0, \\dots, n\\}$ are sum-dominant, and Zhao\nlater showed that this proportion converges to a positive limit as $n \\to\n\\infty$. Related problems, such as constructing explicit families of\nsum-dominant sets, computing the value of the limiting proportion, and\ninvestigating the behavior as the probability of including a given element in\n$A$ to go to zero, have been analyzed extensively.\n  We consider many of these problems in a more general setting. Instead of just\none set $A$, we study sums and differences of pairs of \\emph{correlated} sets\n$(A,B)$.

Furthermore, we show that\nthe limit function $P(\\vec{\\rho})$ is continuous. We also investigate what\nhappens as $p$ decays with $n$, generalizing results of Hegarty-Miller on phase\ntransitions.

Larger data sets improve the resolution of the light\ncurve, however, the time requirement scales with data volume. The data analysis\nis often made more difficult by factors such as a lack of suitable calibration\nsources and the need to correct for variations in observing conditions from one\nimage to another. Often these variations are unpredictable and corrections are\nbased on experience and intuition.\n  The High Efficiency Image Detection & Identification (HEIDI) pipeline\nsoftware rapidly processes sets of astronomical images. HEIDI automatically\nselects multiple sources for calibrating the images using an algorithm that\nprovides a reliable means of correcting for variations between images in a time\nseries. The algorithm takes into account that some sources may intrinsically\nvary on short time scales and excludes these from being used as calibration\nsources.

These tumors represent a difficult\nchallenge because many patients survive a decade or more and may be at a higher\nrisk for treatment-related complications. Specifically, radiation therapy is\nknown to have a relevant effect on survival but in many cases it can be\ndeferred to avoid side effects while maintaining its beneficial effect.\nHowever, a subset of low-grade gliomas manifests more aggressive clinical\nbehavior and requires earlier intervention. Moreover, the effectiveness of\nradiotherapy depends on the tumor characteristics.

In contrast with the standard superfield approach in which\nunbroken supersymmetry plays the leading role, we have shifted the attention to\nthe spontaneously broken supersymmetry. It turns out that in theories in which\nhalf of supersymmetries is spontaneously broken, all physical fermions are just\nthe fermions of the nonlinear realization. Moreover, transformation properties\nof these fermions with respect to broken supersymmetry are the same as in the\nVolkov-Akulov model. Just this completely fixed all possible appearances of\nfermions in the component action: they can enter the action through the\ndeterminant of the vielbein and covariant derivatives, only.

The complete form of the action can be further fixed by\ntwo additional requirements: a) to reproduce the bosonic limit, which is\nexplicitly known in many interesting cases, and b) to have a proper linearized\nform, which has to be invariant with respect to linearized unbroken\nsupersymmetry.
