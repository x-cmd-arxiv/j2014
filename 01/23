While most effects on the CMB anisotropies are widely studied through\ndirect solutions of the Boltzmann equation, the non-linear effect of CMB\nlensing is formulated through the solutions of the geodesic equation.

The combined\nattributes of cooperation and adaptation are necessary to enable networks of\ndetectors to continually learn from streaming data and to continually track\ndrifts in the state of nature when deciding in favor of one hypothesis or\nanother. The results in the paper establish a fundamental scaling law for the\nsteady-state probabilities of miss-detection and false-alarm in the slow\nadaptation regime, when the agents interact with each other according to\ndistributed strategies that employ small constant step-sizes. The latter are\ncritical to enable continuous adaptation and learning. The work establishes\nthree key results. First, it is shown that the output of the collaborative\nprocess at each agent has a steady-state distribution. Second, it is shown that\nthis distribution is asymptotically Gaussian in the slow adaptation regime of\nsmall step-sizes. And third, by carrying out a detailed large deviations\nanalysis, closed-form expressions are derived for the decaying rates of the\nfalse-alarm and miss-detection probabilities. Interesting insights are gained.\nIn particular, it is verified that as the step-size $\\mu$ decreases, the error\nprobabilities are driven to zero exponentially fast as functions of $1/\\mu$,\nand that the error exponents increase linearly in the number of agents. It is\nalso verified that the scaling laws governing errors of detection and errors of\nestimation over networks behave very differently, with the former having an\nexponential decay proportional to $1/\\mu$, while the latter scales linearly\nwith decay proportional to $\\mu$.

Indeed, the following alternative holds: If the Birkhoff\nnormal form of the Hamiltonian at the invariant point satisfies a R\\\"ussmann\ntransversality condition, the fixed point is accumulated by real analytic\nKAM-tori which cover positive Lebesgue measure in the phase space (in this part\nit suffices to assume that $\\o_0$ has rationally independent coordinates).

Unfortunately, the accuracy of\nthis method rapidly deteriorates with increasing noise and thus calls for a\nmore robust procedure that combines signal detection and field estimation. We\nintroduce an estimation method that provides not only the effective or mean\nlongitudinal magnetic field from an observed Stokes V profile but also uses the\nnet absolute polarization of the profile to obtain an estimate of the apparent\n(i.e., velocity resolved) absolute longitudinal magnetic field. By combining\nthe COG method with an orthogonal-matching-pursuit (OMP) approach, we were able\nto decompose observed Stokes profiles with an overcomplete dictionary of\nwavelet-basis functions to reliably reconstruct the observed Stokes profiles in\nthe presence of noise. The elementary wave functions of the sparse\nreconstruction process were utilized to estimate the effective longitudinal\nmagnetic field and the apparent absolute longitudinal magnetic field.

Incomplete state information\nmust be taken into account in the controller's design in order to preserve its\noptimality. The same is true when performing reachability calculations. To\nestimate the probability that the state of a stochastic system reaches, or\nstays within, some set of interest in a given time horizon, it is necessary to\nfind a controller (or at least prove one exists) that drives the system to that\nset with maximum probability. This controller, however, does not have access to\nthe true state of the system. To date, little work has been done on stochastic\nreachability calculations with partially observable states. What work has been\ndone relies on converting the reachability optimization problem to one with an\nadditive cost function, for which theoretical results are well known. Our\napproach is to preserve the multiplicative cost structure when deriving a\nsufficient statistic that reduces the problem to one of perfect state\ninformation. Our transformation includes a change of measure that simplifies\nthe distribution of the sufficient statistic conditioned on its previous value.\nWe develop a dynamic programming recursion for the solution of the equivalent\nperfect information problem, proving that the recursion is valid, an optimal\nsolution exists, and results in the same solution as to the original problem.\nWe also show that our results are equivalent to those for the reformulated\nadditive cost problem, and so such a reformulation is not required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 19:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-23"}

Here we extend these results to different distances from the\nGalactic center, looking for variations of observables that can be related to\non-going and future spectroscopic surveys. By separating the effects of\nkinematic heating and radial migration, we show that migration is much more\nimportant, even for the oldest and hottest stellar population. The\ndistributions of stellar birth guiding radii and final guiding radii\n(signifying contamination from migration and heating, respectively) widen with\nincreasing distance from the Galactic center. As a result, the slope in the\nage-metallicity relation flattens significantly at Galactic radii larger than\nsolar. The radial metallicity and [Mg/Fe] gradients in our model show\nsignificant variations with height above the plane due to changes in the\nmixture of stellar ages. An inversion in the radial metallicity gradient is\nfound from negative to weakly positive (at r<10 kpc), and from positive to\nnegative for the [Mg/Fe] gradient, with increasing distance from the disk\nplane. We relate this to the combined effect of (i) the predominance of young\nstars close to the disk plane and old stars away from it, (ii) the more\nconcentrated older stellar component, and (iii) the flaring of mono-age disk\npopulations. We also investigate the effect of recycled gas flows on the mean\n[Fe/H] and find that in the region 4<r<12 kpc the introduced errors are less\nthan 0.05-0.1 dex, related to the fact that inward and outward flows mostly\ncancel in that radial range.

Cluster galaxy\nvelocities, being $\\ll$c, depend solely on the gravitational potential, whereas\nphoton trajectories reflect the contributions from the gravitational potential\nplus a relativistic-pressure term that depends on the cluster mass. We exploit\nthis phenomenon to constrain the Equation of State (EoS) parameter of the\nfluid, primarily DM, contained in galaxy clusters.

One pathway is through the direct\ncollapse of gas in T_{vir} > 10^4 K halos; however, this requires the\nsuppression of H_2 cooling to prevent fragmentation. In this paper, we examine\na proposed new mechanism for this suppression which relies on cold-mode\naccretion flows leading to shocks at high densities (n > 10^4 cm^{-3}) and\ntemperatures (T > 10^4 K). In such gas, H_2 is efficiently collisionally\ndissociated.

I\npredict and observe that if the pot is held at an angle to the vertical the\nsteady state shape of the fountain is an inverted catenary, and discuss how to\napply boundary conditions to this solution. In the case of a level pot, the\nfountain shape is completely vertical. In this case I predict and observe both\nhow fast the fountain grows to its steady state hight, and how it grows\nquadratically in time if there is no floor. The fountain is driven by an\nanomalous push force from the pot that acts on the link of chain about to come\ninto motion. I confirm this by designing two new chains, one consisting of\nhollow cylinders threaded on a string and one consisting of heavy beads\nseparated by long flexible threads.

This flare type, with two warm coronal emission peaks but only one\nX-ray peak, has been named the EUV late phase. These flares have the distinct\nproperties of i) having a complex magnetic field structure with two initial\nsets of coronal loops, with one upper set overlaying a lower set, ii) having an\neruptive flare initiated in the lower set and disturbing both loop sets, iii)\nhaving the hot coronal emissions emitted only from the lower set, and iv)\nhaving the first peak of the warm coronal emissions associated with the lower\nset and its second peak emitted from the upper set much later. The disturbance\nof the coronal loops by the eruption is at about the same time, but the\nrelaxation and cooling down of the heated coronal loops during the post-flare\nreconnections have different time scales with the longer, upper loops being\nsignificantly delayed from the lower loops. The difference in these cooling\ntime scales is related to the difference between the two peak times of the warm\ncoronal emission and is also apparent in the decay profile of the X-ray\nemissions having two distinct decays, with the first decay slope being steeper\nand the delayed decay slope being smaller during the time of the warm coronal\nemission second peak. The frequency and relationship of the EUV late-phase\ndecay times between the Fe XVI two flare peaks and X-ray decay slopes are\nexamined using three years of SDO/EVE data, and the X-ray dual-decay character\nis then exploited to estimate the frequency of EUV late-phase flares during the\npast four solar cycles. This study indicates that the frequency of EUV\nlate-phase flares peaks before and after each solar cycle minimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 21:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Inclusion of magnetic fields slows those winds\nand leads to Ohmic dissipation. We find wind slowing ranging from 10%-40% for\nreasonable field strengths.

The limit (i) gives rise to a ``velocity kick'' on distant test\nparticles in the scalar and electromagnetic cases, and it gives rise to a\n``memory effect'' (i.e., a permanent change in relative separation of two test\nparticles) in the linearized gravitational case, in agreement with previous\nanalyses.

However, little is currently understood about how such TFETs\nare affected by materials defects and nonidealities. We present measurements of\nthe conductance slope for various InAs/GaSb heterojunctions via two-terminal\nelectrical measurements, which removes three-terminal parasitics and enables\ndirect study on the effect of microstructure on tunnelling. Using this, we can\npredict how subthreshold swings in TFETs can depend on microstructure. We also\ndemonstrate growth and electrical characterization for structures grown by\nmetalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) - a generally more scalable\nprocess compared to molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We determine that misfit\ndislocations and point defects near the interface can lead to energy states in\nthe band-gap and local band bending that result in trap-assisted leakage routes\nand nonuniform band alignment across the junction area that lower the steepness\nof the conductance slope. Despite the small lattice mismatch, misfit\ndislocations still form in InAs on GaSb due to relaxation as a result of large\nstrain from intermixed compositions. This can be circumvented by growing GaSb\non InAs, straining the GaSb underlayer, or lowering the InAs growth temperature\nin the region of the interface. The conductance slope can also be improved by\nannealing the samples at higher temperatures, which we believe acts to\nannihilate point defects and average out major fluctuations in band alignment\nacross the interface. Using a combination of these techniques, we can greatly\nimprove the steepness of the conductance slope which could result in steeper\nsubthreshold swings in TFETs in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 01:20:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 02:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

In line with the recent advances in smart\ntransportation management infrastructures, ITS has turned out to be a promising\nfield of application for artificial intelligence techniques. In particular,\nmultiagent systems seem to be the ideal candidates for the design and\nimplementation of ITS. In fact, drivers can be naturally modelled as autonomous\nagents that interact with the transportation management infrastructure, thereby\ngenerating a large-scale, open, agent-based system. To regulate such a system\nand maintain a smooth and efficient flow of traffic, decentralised mechanisms\nfor the management of the transportation infrastructure are needed.\n  In this article we propose a distributed, market-inspired, mechanism for the\nmanagement of a future urban road network, where intelligent autonomous\nvehicles, operated by software agents on behalf of their human owners, interact\nwith the infrastructure in order to travel safely and efficiently through the\nroad network. Building on the reservation-based intersection control model\nproposed by Dresner and Stone, we consider two different scenarios: one with a\nsingle intersection and one with a network of intersections. In the former, we\nanalyse the performance of a novel policy based on combinatorial auctions for\nthe allocation of reservations. In the latter, we analyse the impact that a\ntraffic assignment strategy inspired by competitive markets has on the drivers\nroute choices. Finally we propose an adaptive management mechanism that\nintegrates the auction-based traffic control policy with the competitive\ntraffic assignment strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-24"}

A major obstacle for the application of\nPlanning in this area lies in the modeling. Obtaining a suitable model to plan\nwith -- ideally a description in PDDL, the most commonly used planning language\n-- is often prohibitively complicated and/or costly.

Our application at SAP, one of the leading\nvendors of enterprise software, demonstrates that even one-to-one model re-use\nis possible.\n  The model in question is called Status and Action Management (SAM). It\ndescribes the behavior of Business Objects (BO), i.e., large-scale data\nstructures, at a level of abstraction corresponding to the language of business\nexperts. SAM covers more than 400 kinds of BOs, each of which is described in\nterms of a set of status variables and how their values are required for, and\naffected by, processing steps (actions) that are atomic from a business\nperspective. SAM was developed by SAP as part of a major model-based software\nengineering effort.

In optimal planning, we\nare interested in finding not just a plan, but one of the cheapest plans. A\nprominent approach to optimal planning these days is heuristic state-space\nsearch, guided by admissible heuristic functions. Numerous admissible\nheuristics have been developed, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and\nit is well known that there is no single \"best heuristic for optimal planning\nin general. Thus, which heuristic to choose for a given planning task is a\ndifficult question. This difficulty can be avoided by combining several\nheuristics, but that requires computing numerous heuristic estimates at each\nstate, and the tradeoff between the time spent doing so and the time saved by\nthe combined advantages of the different heuristics might be high. We present a\nnovel method that reduces the cost of combining admissible heuristics for\noptimal planning, while maintaining its benefits.

So long GRBs may be a useful tool of\nmeasuring the high-redshift star formation rate (SFR). The collapsar model\nexplains GRB formation via the collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star with\n$M> 30M_\\odot$ into a black hole, which may imply a decrease of SFR at high\nredshift. However, we find that the \\emph{Swift} GRBs during 2005-2012 are\nbiased tracing the SFR, including a factor about $(1+z)^{0.5}$, which is in\nagreement with recent results. After taking this factor, the SFR derived from\nGRBs does not show steep drop up to $z\\sim 9.4$. We consider the GRBs produced\nby rapidly rotating metal-poor stars with low masses to explain the\nhigh-redshift GRB rate excess. The chemically homogeneous evolution scenario\n(CHES) of rapidly rotating stars with mass larger than $12M_\\odot$ is\nrecognized as a promising path towards collapsars in connection with long GRBs.\nOur results indicate that the stars in the mass range $12M_\\odot<M<30M_\\odot$\nfor low enough metallicity $Z\\leq 0.004$ with the GRB efficiency factor\n$10^{-5}$ can fit the derived SFR with good accuracy. Combining these two\nfactors, we find that the conversion efficiency from massive stars to GRBs is\nenhanced by a factor of 10, which may be able to explain the excess of the\nhigh-redshift GRB rate. We also investigate the cosmic reionization history\nusing the derived SFR. The GRB-inferred SFR would be sufficient to maintain\ncosmic reionization over $6<z<10$ and reproduce the observed optical depth of\nThomson scattering to the cosmic microwave background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-24"}

This X-ray minimum has two distinct phases - the\nlowest flux phase in the first ~3 weeks and a brighter phase thereafter. In\n2009, the Chandra X-ray Observatory monitored the first phase five times and\nfound the lowest observed flux at ~1.9e-12 ergs cm-2 s-1 (3-8 keV). The\nspectral shape changed such that the hard band above ~4 keV dropped quickly at\nthe beginning and the soft band flux gradually decreased to its lowest observed\nvalue in ~2 weeks. The hard band spectrum had begun to recover by that time.\nThis spectral variation suggests that the shocked gas producing the hottest\nX-ray gas near the apex of the wind-wind collision (WWC) is blocked behind the\ndense inner wind of the primary star, which later occults slightly cooler gas\ndownstream. Shocked gas previously produced by the system at earlier orbital\nphases is suggested to produce the faint residual X-ray emission seen when the\nemission near the apex is completely blocked by the primary wind. The brighter\nphase is probably caused by the re-appearance of the WWC plasma, whose\nemissivity significantly declined during the occultation. We interpret this to\nmean that the X-ray minimum is produced by a hybrid mechanism of an occultation\nand a decline in emissivity of the WWC shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 04:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The standard\napproach to this \"missing mass problem\" has been the postulate of \"dark\nmatter\", meaning an additional, electromagnetically dark, matter component that\nprovides the missing mass. However, direct observational evidence for dark\nmatter has not been found to date. More importantly, astronomical observations\nobtained during the last decade indicate that dark matter cannot explain the\nkinematics of galaxies. Multiple observations show that the discrepancy between\nobserved and dynamical mass is a function of gravitational acceleration (or\nfield strength) but not of other parameters (size, rotation speed, etc.) of a\ngalaxy; the mass discrepancy appears below a characteristic and universal\nacceleration (\"Milgrom's constant\"). Consequently, the idea of a modified law\nof gravity, specifically the ansatz of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), is\nbecoming increasingly important in astrophysics. MOND has successfully\npredicted various important empirical relations of galaxy dynamics, including\nthe famous Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations. MOND is found to be\nconsistent with stellar dynamics from binary stars to clusters of galaxies,\nthus covering stellar systems spanning eight orders of magnitude in size and 14\norders of magnitude in mass. These developments have the potential to initiate\na paradigm shift from dark matter to a modified law of gravity as the physical\nmechanism behind the missing mass problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 09:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In the present\nwork, we aim to clarify conceptual issues and sharpen methods for this purpose,\nusing compactification on ${\\rm K3} \\times {\\rm K3}$ as a test case. Our first\napproach exploits the connection between the stabilization of complex structure\nmoduli and the Noether-Lefschetz problem.

The heterotic-F-theory duality\nindicates that elliptic fibration morphisms should be identified modulo\nisomorphism.

ESPRESSO will combine\nefficiency and extreme spectroscopic precision. ESPRESSO is foreseen to achieve\na gain of two magnitudes with respect to its predecessor HARPS, and to improve\nthe instrumental radial-velocity precision to reach the 10 cm/s level. It can\nbe operated either with a single UT or with up to four UTs, enabling an\nadditional gain in the latter mode. The incoherent combination of four\ntelescopes and the extreme precision requirements called for many innovative\ndesign solutions while ensuring the technical heritage of the successful HARPS\nexperience. ESPRESSO will allow to explore new frontiers in most domains of\nastrophysics that require precision and sensitivity. The main scientific\ndrivers are the search and characterization of rocky exoplanets in the\nhabitable zone of quiet, nearby G to M-dwarfs and the analysis of the\nvariability of fundamental physical constants.

Several eruption models have been proposed that aim to reveal what\nmechanism causes (or triggers) these solar eruptions. Validating these models\nthrough observations represents a fundamental step in our understanding of\nsolar eruptions. We present an analysis of the observation of a filament\neruption that agrees with the torus instability model. This model predicts that\na magnetic flux rope embedded in an ambient field undergoes an eruption when\nthe axis of the flux rope reaches a critical height that depends on the\ntopology of the ambient field. We use the two vantage points of SDO and STEREO\nto reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of the filament, to follow its\nmorphological evolution and to determine its height just before eruption. The\nmagnetograms acquired by SDO/HMI are used to infer the topology of the ambient\nfield and to derive the critical height for the onset of the torus instability.\nOur analysis shows that the torus instability is the trigger of the eruption.\nWe also find that some pre-eruptive processes, such as magnetic reconnection\nduring the observed flares and flux cancellation at the neutral line,\nfacilitated the eruption by bringing the filament to a region where the\nmagnetic field was more vulnerable to the torus instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 11:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In\nthis context, the present work deals with distributed economic dispatch and\ndemand response initiatives for grid-connected microgrids with high-penetration\nof wind power. To cope with the challenge of the wind's intrinsically\nstochastic availability, a novel energy planning approach involving the actual\nwind energy as well as the energy traded with the main grid, is introduced. A\nstochastic optimization problem is formulated to minimize the microgrid net\ncost, which includes conventional generation cost as well as the expected\ntransaction cost incurred by wind uncertainty. To bypass the prohibitively\nhigh-dimensional integration involved, an efficient sample average\napproximation method is utilized to obtain a solver with guaranteed\nconvergence. Leveraging the special infrastructure of the microgrid, a\ndecentralized algorithm is further developed via the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers. Case studies are tested to corroborate the merits of the\nnovel approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 12:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-24"}

Collisions and cometary activity have been used to\nexplain the process of surface refreshing of TNOs and Centaurs. These processes\ncan produce surface heterogeneity that can be studied by collecting information\nat different rotational phases. The aims of this work are to study the surface\ncomposition of (20000)Varuna, a TNO with a diameter ~650km and to search for\nindications of rotational variability. We observed Varuna during two\nconsecutive nights in January 2011 with NICS@TNG obtaining a set of spectra\ncovering the whole rotation period of Varuna. After studying the spectra\ncorresponding to different rotational phases, we did not find any indication of\nsurface variability. In all the spectra, we detect an absorption at 2{\\mu}m,\nsuggesting the presence of water ice on the surface. We do not detect any other\nvolatiles on the surface, although the S/N is not high enough to discard their\npresence. Based on scattering models, we present two possible compositions\ncompatible with our set of data and discuss their implications in the frame of\nthe collisional history of the Kuiper Belt. We find that the most probable\ncomposition for the surface of Varuna is a mixture of amorphous silicates,\ncomplex organics, and water ice. This composition is compatible with all the\nmaterials being primordial. However, our data can also be fitted by models\ncontaining up to a 10% of methane ice. For an object with the characteristics\nof Varuna, this volatile could not be primordial, so an event, such as an\nenergetic impact, would be needed to explain its presence on the surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 13:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We simulate the interaction with the ionospheric plasma ram flow\nwith the plasma brake tether by a high performance electrostatic particle in\ncell code to evaluate the thrust. The tether is assumed to be perpendicular to\nthe flow. We perform runs for different tether voltage, magnetic field\norientation and plasma ion mass. We show that a simple analytical thrust\nformula reproduces most of the simulation results well. The interaction with\nthe tether and the plasma flow is laminar (i.e., smooth and not turbulent) when\nthe magnetic field is perpendicular to the tether and the flow. If the magnetic\nfield is parallel to the tether, the behaviour is unstable and thrust is\nreduced by a modest factor. The case when the magnetic field is aligned with\nthe flow can also be unstable, but does not result in notable thrust reduction.\nWe also fix an error in an earlier reference.

We illustrate our discussions\nwith the example of the cutoff AdS fluid, for which we find the precise\ninterpretation in terms of deformations of the UV conformal field theory.\nFinally we discuss the relation between the modern fluid/gravity approach taken\nin this paper and the earlier membrane paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 14:03:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2015 17:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

The\nlaser's spin density, that can be expressed in terms of the lase's\nelectromagnetic fields and potentials, couples to the electron's spin via a\nrelativistic correction to the Pauli equation.

Thick current layers start reconnecting when\nbeing forced by plasma inflow to thin. For almost half a century the physical\nmechanism of reconnection has remained a mystery. Spacecraft in situ\nobservations in combination with sophisticated numerical simulations in two and\nthree dimensions recently clarified the mist, finding that reconnection\nproduces a specific structure of the current layer inside the electron inertial\n(also called electron diffusion) region around the reconnection site, the X\nline. Onset of reconnection is attributed to pseudo-viscous contributions of\nthe electron pressure tensor aided by electron inertia and drag, creating a\ncomplicated structured electron current sheet, electric fields, and an electron\nexhaust extended along the current layer. We review the general background\ntheory and recent developments in numerical simulation on collisionless\nreconnection. It is impossible to cover the entire field of reconnection in a\nshort space-limited review. The presentation necessarily remains cursory,\ndetermined by our taste, preferences, and knowledge. Only a small amount of\nobservations is included in order to support the few selected numerical\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 15:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-24"}

With the\ngoal of maximizing the secondary user (SU) throughput subject to constraints on\nthe primary user (PU) outage probability we formulate a joint problem of\nspectrum sensing and channel state estimation. The problem is cast into a\nsequential framework since sensing time minimization is crucial for throughput\nmaximization. In the optimum solution, the sensing decision rule is coupled\nwith the channel estimator, making the separate treatment of the sensing and\nchannel estimation strictly suboptimal. Using such a joint structure for\nspectrum sensing and channel estimation we propose a distributed (cooperative)\ndynamic spectrum access scheme under statistical channel state information\n(CSI). In the proposed scheme, the SUs report their sufficient statistics to a\nfusion center (FC) via level-triggered sampling, a nonuniform sampling\ntechnique that is known to be bandwidth-and-energy efficient. Then, the FC\nmakes a sequential spectrum sensing decision using local statistics and channel\nestimates, and selects the SU with the best transmission opportunity. The\nselected SU, using the sensing decision and its channel estimates, computes the\ntransmit power and starts data transmission. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed scheme significantly outperforms its conventional\ncounterparts, under the same PU outage constraints, in terms of the achievable\nSU throughput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 20:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-24"}

Modeling\nsuch distributions presents several computational challenges, however, due to\nthe factorial size of the set of rankings over an item set. Some of these\nchallenges are quite familiar to the artificial intelligence community, such as\nhow to compactly represent a distribution over a combinatorially large space,\nand how to efficiently perform probabilistic inference with these\nrepresentations. With respect to ranking, however, there is the additional\nchallenge of what we refer to as human task complexity users are rarely willing\nto provide a full ranking over a long list of candidates, instead often\npreferring to provide partial ranking information. Simultaneously addressing\nall of these challenges i.e., designing a compactly representable model which\nis amenable to efficient inference and can be learned using partial ranking\ndata is a difficult task, but is necessary if we would like to scale to\nproblems with nontrivial size. In this paper, we show that the recently\nproposed riffled independence assumptions cleanly and efficiently address each\nof the above challenges. In particular, we establish a tight mathematical\nconnection between the concepts of riffled independence and of partial\nrankings. This correspondence not only allows us to then develop efficient and\nexact algorithms for performing inference tasks using riffled independence\nbased represen- tations with partial rankings, but somewhat surprisingly, also\nshows that efficient inference is not possible for riffle independent models\n(in a certain sense) with observations which do not take the form of partial\nrankings.

This paper presents two different\nalgorithms towards this goal. The first algorithm is a weakly supervised\nmachine learning approach for classification of temporal relations between\nevents. In the first stage, the algorithm learns a general classifier from an\nannotated corpus. Then, inspired by the hypothesis of \"one type of temporal\nrelation per discourse, it extracts useful information from a cluster of\ntopically related documents. We show that by combining the global information\nof such a cluster with local decisions of a general classifier, a bootstrapping\ncross-document classifier can be built to extract temporal relations between\nevents. Our experiments show that without any additional annotated data, the\naccuracy of the proposed algorithm is higher than that of several previous\nsuccessful systems. The second proposed method for temporal relation extraction\nis based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Within EM, we used\ndifferent techniques such as a greedy best-first search and integer linear\nprogramming for temporal inconsistency removal.

More precisely, we improve the translation from a\nresource-poor source language X_1 into a resource-rich language Y given a\nbi-text containing a limited number of parallel sentences for X_1-Y and a\nlarger bi-text for X_2-Y for some resource-rich language X_2 that is closely\nrelated to X_1. This is achieved by taking advantage of the opportunities that\nvocabulary overlap and similarities between the languages X_1 and X_2 in\nspelling, word order, and syntax offer: (1) we improve the word alignments for\nthe resource-poor language, (2) we further augment it with additional\ntranslation options, and (3) we take care of potential spelling differences\nthrough appropriate transliteration. The evaluation for Indonesian- >English\nusing Malay and for Spanish -> English using Portuguese and pretending Spanish\nis resource-poor shows an absolute gain of up to 1.35 and 3.37 BLEU points,\nrespectively, which is an improvement over the best rivaling approaches, while\nusing much less additional data. Overall, our method cuts the amount of\nnecessary \"real training data by a factor of 2--5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-01-28"}

Subsequent analysis by Panneton\nand L'Ecuyer has lowered the expectations raised by Marsaglia's paper, showing\nseveral weaknesses of such generators, verified experimentally using the\nTestU01 suite. Nonetheless, many of the weaknesses of xorshift generators fade\naway if their result is scrambled by a non-linear operation (as originally\nsuggested by Marsaglia). In this paper we explore the space of possible\ngenerators obtained by multiplying the result of a xorshift generator by a\nsuitable constant. We sample generators at 100 equispaced points of their state\nspace and obtain detailed statistics that lead us to choices of parameters that\nimprove on the current ones. We then explore for the first time the space of\nhigh-dimensional xorshift generators, following another suggestion in\nMarsaglia's paper, finding choices of parameters providing periods of length\n$2^{1024} - 1$ and $2^{4096} - 1$. The resulting generators are of extremely\nhigh quality, faster than current similar alternatives, and generate\nlong-period sequences passing strong statistical tests using only eight logical\noperations, one addition and one multiplication by a constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2014 19:18:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Mar 2014 18:54:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 09:44:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2016 23:36:58 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 06:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-14"}
