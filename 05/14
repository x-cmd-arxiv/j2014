To address this challenge, we present a general,\nboosting-inspired framework for combining weak evidence of entity associations\ninto a robust similarity metric. Building on previous work, we explore the\nextent to which different local quality measurements yield graph\nrepresentations that are suitable for community detection. We present empirical\nresults on a variety of datasets demonstrating the utility of this framework,\nespecially with respect to real datasets where noise and scale present serious\nchallenges.

Emphasis is placed on the effects of scaling on\ncoordinate systems. Effects of scaling are represented by a scalar field,\n$\\theta,$ that appears in gauge theories as a spin zero boson. Gauge theory\nconsiderations led to the concept of local mathematics, as expressed through\nthe use of universes, as collections of local mathematical systems at each\npoint, x, of a space time manifold, M. Both local and global coordinate charts\nare described. These map M into either local or global coordinate systems\nwithin a universe or between universes, respectively. The lifting of global\nexpressions of nonlocal physical quantities, expressed by space and or time\nintegrals or derivatives on M, to integrals or derivatives on coordinate\nsystems, is described. The assumption of local mathematics and universes makes\nintegrals and derivatives, on M or on global charts, meaningless. They acquire\nmeaning only when mapped into a local universe. The effect of scaling, by\nincluding the effect of $\\theta$ into the local maps, is described. The lack of\nexperimental evidence for $\\theta$ so far shows that the coupling constant of\n$\\theta$ to matter fields must be very small compared to the fine structure\nconstant. Also the gradient of $\\theta$ must be very small in the local region\nof cosmological space and time occupied by us as observers. So far, there are\nno known restrictions on $\\theta$ or its gradient in regions of space and/or\ntime that are far away from our local region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 16:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In this paper we\nadapt Generalized Counting First Order Variable Elimination (GC-FOVE) to the\nproblem of computing the probability of queries to probabilistic logic programs\nunder the distribution semantics. In particular, we extend the Prolog Factor\nLanguage (PFL) to include two new types of factors that are needed for\nrepresenting ProbLog programs. These factors take into account the existing\ncausal independence relationships among random variables and are managed by the\nextension to variable elimination proposed by Zhang and Poole for dealing with\nconvergent variables and heterogeneous factors. Two new operators are added to\nGC-FOVE for treating heterogeneous factors. The resulting algorithm, called\nLP$^2$ for Lifted Probabilistic Logic Programming, has been implemented by\nmodifying the PFL implementation of GC-FOVE and tested on three benchmarks for\nlifted inference.

As a result, after induction of gene expression, the time at which a\nspecific protein count is reached is stochastic as well. Therefore events\ntaking place at a critical protein level will see stochasticity in their\ntiming. First-passage time (FPT), the time at which a stochastic process hits a\ncritical threshold, provides a framework to model such events. Here, we\ninvestigate stochasticity in FPT. Particularly, we consider events for which\ncontrolling stochasticity is advantageous. As a possible regulatory mechanism,\nwe also investigate effect of auto-regulation, where the transcription rate of\ngene depends on protein count, on stochasticity of FPT. Specifically, we\ninvestigate for an optimal auto-regulation which minimizes stochasticity in\nFPT, given fixed mean FPT and threshold.\n  For this purpose, we model the gene expression at a single cell level. We\nfind analytic formulas for statistical moments of the FPT in terms of model\nparameters. Moreover, we examine the gene expression model with\nauto-regulation. Interestingly, our results show that the stochasticity in FPT,\nfor a fixed mean, is minimized when the transcription rate is independent of\nprotein count. Further, we discuss the results in context of lysis time of an\n\\textit{E. coli} cell infected by a $\\lambda$ phage virus. An optimal lysis\ntime provides evolutionary advantage to the $\\lambda$ phage, suggesting a\npossible regulation to minimize its stochasticity. Our results indicate that\nthere is no auto-regulation of the protein responsible for lysis. Moreover,\ncongruent to experimental evidences, our analysis predicts that the expression\nof the lysis protein should have a small burst size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 16:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-28"}

The first coupling method ensures that there is no drift along the\nsubdomain interface but does not facilitate explicit/implicit coupling. The\nsecond coupling method allows explicit/implicit coupling with controlled (but\nnon-zero) drift in the solution along the subdomain interface. Several\ncanonical problems will be solved to numerically verify the theoretical\npredictions, and to illustrate the overall performance of the proposed coupling\nmethods.

At high energies NuSTAR\nclearly detects non-thermal emission up to ~20 keV that extends along the\neastern and northern rim of the supernova shell. The broadband images clearly\ndemonstrate that X-ray emission from the North Spur and Eastern Limb results\npredominantly from non-thermal processes. We detect a break in the spatially\nintegrated X-ray spectrum at ~9 keV that cannot be reproduced by current SED\nmodels, implying either a more complex electron injection spectrum or an\nadditional process such as diffusion compared to what has been considered in\nprevious work. We use spatially resolved maps to derive an energy-dependent\ncooling length scale, $L(E) \\propto E^{m}$ with $m = -0.21 \\pm 0.01$. We find\nthis to be inconsistent with the model for the morphological evolution with\nenergy described by Kennel & Coroniti (1984). This value, along with the\nobserved steepening in power-law index between radio and X-ray, can be\nquantitatively explained as an energy-loss spectral break in the simple scaling\nmodel of Reynolds (2009), assuming particle advection dominates over diffusion.\nThis interpretation requires a substantial departure from spherical\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD), magnetic-flux-conserving outflow, most plausibly in\nthe form of turbulent magnetic-field amplification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 17:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Although methods exist for\nunsupervised gene set testing, they predominantly compute enrichment relative\nto clusters of the genomic variables with performance strongly dependent on the\nclustering algorithm and number of clusters. Results: We propose a novel\nmethod, spectral gene set enrichment (SGSE), for unsupervised competitive\ntesting of the association between gene sets and empirical data sources. SGSE\nfirst computes the statistical association between gene sets and principal\ncomponents (PCs) using our principal component gene set enrichment (PCGSE)\nmethod. The overall statistical association between each gene set and the\nspectral structure of the data is then computed by combining the PC-level\np-values using the weighted Z-method with weights set to the PC variance scaled\nby Tracey-Widom test p-values.

To\npredict the diversity of exoplanet compositions, previous works modeled\nplanetesimal composition as the equilibrium chemical composition of a proto-\nplanetary disk at a single time. However, planetesimals form over an extended\nperiod of time, during which, elements sequentially condense out of the gas as\nthe disk cools and are accreted onto planetesi- mals. To account for the\nevolution of the disk during planetesimal formation, we couple models of disk\nchemistry and dynamics with a prescription for planetesimal formation. We then\nfollow the growth of these planetesimals into terrestrial planets with N-body\nsimulations of late stage planet formation to evaluate the effect of sequential\ncondensation on the bulk composition of planets. We find that our model\nproduces results similar to those of earlier models for disks with C/O ratios\nclose to the solar value (0.54). However, in disks with C/O ratios greater than\n0.8, carbon rich planetesimals form throughout a much larger radial range of\nthe disk. Furthermore, our model produces carbon rich planetesimals in disks\nwith C/O ratios as low as ~0.65, which is not possible in the static\nequilibrium chemistry case. These results suggest that (1) there may be a large\npopulation of short period carbon rich planets around moderately carbon\nenhanced stars (0.65 < C/O < 0.8) and (2) carbon rich planets can form\nthroughout the terrestrial planet region around carbon rich stars (C/O > 0.8).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 18:43:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-14"}

In the symmetric case, the graph has two equally sized\nclusters and vertices connect with probability $p$ within clusters and $q$\nacross clusters. In the past two decades, a large body of literature in\nstatistics and computer science has focused on providing lower-bounds on the\nscaling of $|p-q|$ to ensure exact recovery. In this paper, we identify a sharp\nthreshold phenomenon for exact recovery: if $\\alpha=pn/\\log(n)$ and\n$\\beta=qn/\\log(n)$ are constant (with $\\alpha>\\beta$), recovering the\ncommunities with high probability is possible if $\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2} -\n\\sqrt{\\alpha \\beta}>1$ and impossible if $\\frac{\\alpha+\\beta}{2} - \\sqrt{\\alpha\n\\beta}<1$. In particular, this improves the existing bounds. This also sets a\nnew line of sight for efficient clustering algorithms. While maximum likelihood\n(ML) achieves the optimal threshold (by definition), it is in the worst-case\nNP-hard. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm based on a semidefinite\nprogramming relaxation of ML, which is proved to succeed in recovering the\ncommunities close to the threshold, while numerical experiments suggest it may\nachieve the threshold.

New observations\nperformed towards low-mass protostars suggest that water presents a lower\ndeuteration in the warm inner gas than in the cold external envelope. We\ncoupled a gas-grain astrochemical model with a one-dimension model of\ncollapsing core to properly follow the formation and the deuteration of\ninterstellar ices as well as their subsequent evaporation in the low-mass\nprotostellar envelopes with the aim of interpreting the spatial and temporal\nevolutions of their deuteration. The astrochemical model follows the formation\nand the evaporation of ices with a multilayer approach and also includes a\nstate-of-the-art deuterated chemical network by taking the spin states of H$_2$\nand light ions into account. Because of their slow formation, interstellar ices\nare chemically heterogeneous and show an increase of their deuterium\nfractionation towards the surface. The differentiation of the deuteration in\nices induces an evolution of the deuteration within protostellar envelopes. The\nwarm inner region is poorly deuterated because it includes the whole molecular\ncontent of ices while the deuteration predicted in the cold external envelope\nscales with the highly deuterated surface of ices. We are able to reproduce the\nobserved evolution of water deuteration within protostellar envelopes but we\nare still unable to predict the super-high deuteration observed for\nformaldehyde and methanol.

Particularly, those discs\nwhich photoevaporative models struggle to explain. Assuming the standard\npicture for how massive planets sculpt their parent discs, along with the\nobserved accretion rates in `transition' discs, we find that the accretion\nluminosity from the forming planet is significant, and can dominate over the\nstellar luminosity at the gap edge. This planetary accretion luminosity can\napply a significant radiation pressure to small ($s\\lesssim 1\\mu$m) dust\nparticles provided they are suitably decoupled from the gas. Secular evolution\ncalculations that account for the evolution of the gas and dust components in a\ndisc with an embedded, accreting planet, show that only with the addition of\nthe radiation pressure can we explain the full observed characteristics of a\n`transition' disc (NIR dip in the SED, mm cavity and high accretion rate). At\nsuitably high planet masses ($\\gtrsim 3-4$ M$_J$), radiation pressure from the\naccreting planet is able to hold back the small dust particles, producing a\nheavily dust-depleted inner disc that is optically thin (vertically and\nradially) to Infra-Red radiation. We use our models to calculate synthetic\nobservations and present a observational evolutionary scenario for a forming\nplanet, sculpting its parent disc. The planet-disc system will present as a\n`transition' disc with a dip in the SED, only when the planet mass and\nplanetary accretion rate is high enough. At other times it will present as a\ndisc with a primordial SED, but with a cavity in the mm, as observed in a\nhandful of protoplanetary discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 20:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Specifically we compare the mass loss\nrate, velocity dispersion, relaxation time, and the mass function of star\nclusters on circular and eccentric orbits. For a given perigalactic distance,\nincreasing orbital eccentricity slows the dynamical evolution of a cluster due\nto a weaker mean tidal field. However, we find that perigalactic passes and\ntidal heating due to an eccentric orbit can partially compensate for the\ndecreased mean tidal field by energizing stars to higher velocities and\nstripping additional stars from the cluster, accelerating the relaxation\nprocess. We find that the corresponding circular orbit which best describes the\nevolution of a cluster on an eccentric orbit is much less than its semi-major\naxis or time averaged galactocentric distance. Since clusters spend the\nmajority of their lifetimes near apogalacticon, the properties of clusters\nwhich appear very dynamically evolved for a given galactocentric distance can\nbe explained by an eccentric orbit. Additionally we find that the evolution of\nthe slope of the mass function within the core radius is roughly\norbit-independent, so it could place additional constraints on the initial mass\nand initial size of globular clusters with solved orbits.

We use 3D local hydrodynamic simulations of cooling,\nself-gravitating disks to resolve how motions driven by \"gravito-turbulence\"\nvary with height. We find that gravito-turbulence is practically as vigorous at\naltitude as at depth: even though gas at altitude is much too rarefied to be\nitself self-gravitating, it is strongly forced by self-gravitating\noverdensities at the midplane. The long-range nature of gravity means that\nturbulent velocities are nearly uniform vertically, increasing by just a factor\nof 2 from midplane to surface, even as the density ranges over nearly three\norders of magnitude. The insensitivity of gravito-turbulence to height\ncontrasts with the behavior of disks afflicted by the magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI); in the latter case, non-circular velocities increase by at\nleast a factor of 15 from midplane to surface, with various non-ideal effects\nonly magnifying this factor. The distinct vertical profiles of\ngravito-turbulence vs. MRI turbulence may be used in conjunction with\nmeasurements of non-thermal linewidths at various depths to identify the source\nof transport in protoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 20:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Specifically, an oblate\nellipsoidal tumor shape robustly occurs when the tumors grow in hydrogels that\nare stiffer than the tumors, but when they grow in more compliant hydrogels\nthey remain closer to spherical in shape. Using large scale, nonlinear\nelasticity computations we show that the oblate ellipsoidal shape minimizes the\nelastic free energy of the tumor-hydrogel system.

For such games, a fundamental question asks: How do\nthe details of the algorithm's description influence agents' strategic\nbehavior?\n  We analyze two versions of an AIG based on the set-cover optimization\nproblem. In these games, joint strategies correspond to instances of the\nset-cover problem, with each subset (of a given universe of elements)\nrepresenting the strategy of a single agent. Outcomes are covers computed from\nthe joint strategies by a set-cover algorithm. In one variant of this game,\noutcomes are computed by a deterministic greedy algorithm, and the other\nvariant utilizes a non-deterministic form of the greedy algorithm. We\ncharacterize Nash equilibrium strategies for both versions of the game, finding\nthat agents' strategies can vary considerably between the two settings. In\nparticular, we find that the version of the game based on the deterministic\nalgorithm only admits Nash equilibrium in which agents choose strategies (i.e.,\nsubsets) containing at most one element, with no two agents picking the same\nelement. On the other hand, in the version of the game based on the\nnon-deterministic algorithm, Nash equilibrium strategies can include agents\nwith zero, one, or every element, and the same element can appear in the\nstrategies of multiple agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 20:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}

If the space is lower\ndimensional in the high energy regime, then there are no ultraviolet\ndivergencies in field theories, it is possible to quantize gravity, and the\ntheory of matter plus gravity is free of divergencies or renormalizable. If the\nspace is higher dimensional at cosmological scales, then some cosmological\nproblems (including the cosmological constant problem) can be attacked from a\ncompletely new perspective. In this paper, we construct an explicit model of\n\"evolving dimensions\" in which the dimensions open up as the temperature of the\nuniverse drops. We adopt the string theory framework in which the dimensions\nare fields that live on the string worldsheet, and add temperature dependent\nmass terms for them. At the Big Bang, all the dimensions are very heavy and are\nnot excited. As the universe cools down, dimensions open up one by one. Thus,\nthe dimensionality of the space we live in depends on the energy or temperature\nthat we are probing. In particular, we provide a kinematic Brandenberger-Vafa\nargument for how a discrete {\\it causal set}, and eventually a continuum\n$(3+1)$-dim spacetime along with Einstein gravity emerge in the Infrared from\nthe worldsheet action. The $(3+1)$-dim Planck mass and the string scale become\ndirectly related, {\\it without any} compactification. Amongst other\npredictions, we argue that LHC might be blind to new physics even if it comes\nat the TeV scale.

Is\n$\\lambda$-calculus a reasonable machine? Is there a way to measure the\ncomputational complexity of a $\\lambda$-term? This paper presents the first\ncomplete positive answer to this long-standing problem. Moreover, our answer is\ncompletely machine-independent and based over a standard notion in the theory\nof $\\lambda$-calculus: the length of a leftmost-outermost derivation to normal\nform is an invariant cost model. Such a theorem cannot be proved by directly\nrelating $\\lambda$-calculus with Turing machines or random access machines,\nbecause of the size explosion problem: there are terms that in a linear number\nof steps produce an exponentially long output. The first step towards the\nsolution is to shift to a notion of evaluation for which the length and the\nsize of the output are linearly related. This is done by adopting the linear\nsubstitution calculus (LSC), a calculus of explicit substitutions modelled\nafter linear logic and proof-nets and admitting a decomposition of\nleftmost-outermost derivations with the desired property. Thus, the LSC is\ninvariant with respect to, say, random access machines. The second step is to\nshow that LSC is invariant with respect to the $\\lambda$-calculus. The size\nexplosion problem seems to imply that this is not possible: having the same\nnotions of normal form, evaluation in the LSC is exponentially longer than in\nthe $\\lambda$-calculus. We solve such an impasse by introducing a new form of\nshared normal form and shared reduction, deemed useful. Useful evaluation\navoids those steps that only unshare the output without contributing to\n$\\beta$-redexes, i.e., the steps that cause the blow-up in size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 21:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}

Based on a general\neffective Lagrangian that reproduces precisely the two-body $s$-wave scattering\nphase shift, we obtain a nonperturbative expression of the energy density as a\nfunction of the polarization by using the Bethe-Goldstone ladder resummation.\nFor hard sphere potential, the predicted critical gas parameter $k_{\\rm\nF}a=0.816$ and the spin susceptibility agree well with the results from\nfixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. In general, positive and\nnegative effective ranges have opposite effects on the critical gas parameter\n$k_{\\rm F}a$: While a positive effective range reduces the critical gas\nparameter, a negative effective range increases it. For attractive potential or\nFeshbach resonance model, the many-body upper branch exhibits an energy maximum\nat $k_{\\rm F}a=\\alpha$ with $\\alpha=1.34$ from the Bethe-Goldstone ladder\nresummation, which is qualitatively consistent with experimental results. The\nmany-body T-matrix has a positive-energy pole for $k_{\\rm F}a>\\alpha$ and it\nbecomes impossible to distinguish the bound state and the scattering state.\nThese positive-energy bound states become occupied and therefore the upper\nbranch reaches an energy maximum at $k_{\\rm F}a=\\alpha$. In the zero range\nlimit, there exists a narrow window ($0.86<k_{\\rm F}a<1.56$) for the\nferromagnetic phase. At sufficiently large negative effective range, the\nferromagnetic phase disappears. On the other hand, the appearance of\npositive-energy bound state resonantly enhances the two-body decay rate around\n$k_{\\rm F}a=\\alpha$ and may prevent the study of equilibrium phases and\nferromagnetism of the upper branch Fermi gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 01:02:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 2014 20:39:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 17:20:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 16:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-03"}

A contamination event may be poorly predictable dynamic\nprocess due to the interactions of consumers and utility managers during an\nevent. Consumers that become aware of a threat may select protective actions\nthat change their water demands from typical demand patterns, and new hydraulic\nconditions can arise that differ from conditions that are predicted when\ndemands are considered as exogenous inputs. Consequently, the movement of the\ncontaminant plume in the pipe network may shift from its expected trajectory. A\nsociotechnical model is developed here to integrate agent-based models of\nconsumers with an engineering water distribution system model and capture the\ndynamics between consumer behaviors and the water distribution system for\npredicting contaminant transport and public exposure. Consumers are simulated\nas agents with behaviors defined for water use activities, mobility,\nword-of-mouth communication, and demand reduction, based on a set of rules\nrepresenting an agents autonomy and reaction to health impacts, the\nenvironment, and the actions of other agents. As consumers decrease their water\nuse, the demand exerted on the water distribution system is updated; as the\nflow directions and volumes shift in response, the location of the contaminant\nplume is updated and the amount of contaminant consumed by each agent is\ncalculated. The framework is tested through simulating realistic contamination\nscenarios for a virtual city and water distribution system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 02:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}

This\nproblem has drawn renewed interest due to recent determinations of gas mass\nfractions beyond R200, which appear to be considerably larger than the cosmic\nmean, and because the clusters' total Sunyaev-Zel'dovich flux receives a\nsignificant contribution from these regions. Here, we use a large suite of\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the clumpiness of density and\npressure and employ different variants of simulated physics, including\nradiative gas physics and thermal feedback by active galactic nuclei. We find\nthat density and pressure clumping closely trace each other as a function of\nradius, but the bias on density remains on average < 20% within the virial\nradius R200. At larger radius, clumping increases steeply due to the continuous\ninfall of coherent structures that have not yet passed the accretion shock.\nDensity and pressure clumping increase with cluster mass and redshift, which\nprobes on average dynamically younger objects that are still in the process of\nassembling. The angular power spectra of gas density and pressure show that the\nclumping signal is dominated by comparably large substructures with scales\n>R200/5, signaling the presence of gravitationally-driven \"super-clumping\". In\ncontrast, the angular power spectrum of the dark matter (DM) shows an almost\nuniform size distribution due to unimpeded subhalos. The quadrupolar anisotropy\ndominates the signal and correlates well across different radii as a result of\nthe prolateness of the DM potential. We provide a synopsis of the radial\ndependence of the clusters' non-equilibrium measures (kinetic pressure support,\nellipticity, and clumping) that all increase sharply beyond R200.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 02:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

ASP solvers implement the stable\nmodel semantics that eliminates circular derivations between Boolean variables\nfrom the solutions of a logic program. Due to this, ASP solvers are better\nsuited than propositional satisfiability (SAT) and Constraint Programming (CP)\nsolvers to solve a certain class of problems whose specification includes\ninductive definitions such as reachability in a graph. On the other hand, ASP\nsolvers suffer from the grounding bottleneck that occurs due to their inability\nto model finite domain variables. Furthermore, the existing stable model\nsemantics are not sufficient to disallow circular reasoning on the bounds of\nnumeric variables. An example where this is required is in modelling shortest\npaths between nodes in a graph. Just as reachability can be encoded as an\ninductive definition with one or more base cases and recursive rules, shortest\npaths between nodes can also be modelled with similar base cases and recursive\nrules for their upper bounds. This deficiency of stable model semantics\nintroduces another type of grounding bottleneck in ASP systems that cannot be\nremoved by naively merging ASP with CP solvers, but requires a theoretical\nextension of the semantics from Booleans and normal rules to bounds over\nnumeric variables and more general rules. In this work, we propose Bound\nFounded Answer Set Programming (BFASP) that resolves this issue and\nconsequently, removes all types of grounding bottleneck inherent in ASP\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 05:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}

In this paper we show by means of a numerical model\nthe impossibility that our civilization reaches the point of technological\nsingularity in the near future. We propose that this point may be reached when\nInternet data centers are based on \"computer machines\" to be more effective in\nterms of power consumption than current ones. We speculate about what we have\ncalled 'Nooscomputer' or N-computer a hypothetical machine which would consume\nfar less power allowing our civilization to reach the point of technological\nsingularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 06:47:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}

The purpose of this paper is to report a qualitative study of Chinese\nprofessional working mothers that explored the perceptions of online Master's\nof Business Administration (MBA) programmes as a tool for career progression\nfor working mothers balancing work and family in China. The objective was to\nexamine existing work-family and career progression conflicts, the perceived\nusefulness of online MBA in balancing work-family and career aspirations, and\nthe perceived ease of use of e-learning. Using Davis's (1989) technology\nacceptance model (TAM), the research drew on in-depth interviews with 10 female\npart-time MBA students from a university in Wuhan. The data were analysed\nthrough coding and transcribing. The findings showed that conflicts arose where\ndemanding work schedules competed with family obligations, studies, and caring\nfor children and the elderly. Online MBA programmes were viewed as a viable\ntool for balancing work and family and studying, given its flexible time\nmanagement capabilities. However, consideration must be given to address\nstudents' motivation issues, lack of networking, lack of face-to-face\ninteraction, and quality. The research findings emphasise the pragmatic need to\nre-align higher education policy and practice to position higher education\ne-learning as a trustable education delivery channel in China. By shedding\nlight on the prevailing work-family conflict experienced by women seeking\ncareer advancement, this study suggests developing better gender-supporting\npolicies and innovative e-learning practices to champion online MBA programme\nfor this target niche.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 06:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}

The nonvanishing\ntotal angular momentum (torsion) of the Universe enters as a negative effective\ndensity term in the Einstein-Cartan equations causing partial cancellation of\nthe mass density. The integrated Sachs-Wolfe contribution of the\nEinstein-Cartan model is negative, thus it can provide partial cancellation of\nthe large scale power of the TT CMB spectrum.

In this\npaper, we present such a straightforward and efficient preprocessing approach\nby exploiting the GPU. The basic idea behind our approach is to discard the\npoints that locate inside a convex polygon formed by 16 extreme points. Due to\nthe fact that the extreme points of a point set do not alter when all points\nare rotated in the same angle, four groups of extreme points with min or max x\nor y coordinates can be found in the original point set and three rotated point\nsets. These 16 extreme points are then used to form a convex polygon. We check\nall input points and discard the points that locate inside the convex polygon.\nWe use the remaining points to calculate the expected convex hull. Experimental\nresults show that: when employing the proposed preprocessing algorithm, it\nachieves the speedups of about 4x ~5x on average and 5x ~ 6x in the best cases\nover the cases where the proposed approach is not used. In addition, more than\n99% input points can be discarded in most experimental tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 11:16:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 20:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-30"}

Here we give\ntheoretical issues on the discrete convolution approximation with a first order\n(1st-RF) and a third order (3rd-RF) recursive filters. Numerical experiments\nconfirm given error bounds and show the benefits, in terms of accuracy and\nperformance, of the 3-rd RF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 12:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}

The effects of isospin\nasymmetry and strangeness of the medium on the masses of the vector mesons are\nalso studied in the present work. The $\\phi$ meson is observed to have marginal\ndrop in its mass in the nuclear medium. However, the strangeness of the medium\nis seen to lead to an appreciable increase in its mass arising due to\nscattering with the hyperons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 14:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In the case of a running coupling, we construct\napproximate solutions in the form of truncated series obtained via successive\niterations, whose convergence is well under control.

Indeed, estimating the\nshape dimension is often the first step in studying the processes or phenomena\nassociated to the data. Among the many dimension detection algorithms proposed\nin various fields, a few can provide theoretical guarantee on the correctness\nof the estimated dimension. However, the correctness usually requires certain\nregularity of the input: the input points are either uniformly randomly sampled\nin a statistical setting, or they form the so-called\n$(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-sample which can be neither too dense nor too sparse.\n  Here, we propose a purely topological technique to detect dimensions. Our\nalgorithm is provably correct and works under a more relaxed sampling\ncondition: we do not require uniformity, and we also allow Hausdorff noise. Our\napproach detects dimension by determining local homology. The computation of\nthis topological structure is much less sensitive to the local distribution of\npoints, which leads to the relaxation of the sampling conditions. Furthermore,\nby leveraging various developments in computational topology, we show that this\nlocal homology at a point $z$ can be computed \\emph{exactly} for manifolds\nusing Vietoris-Rips complexes whose vertices are confined within a local\nneighborhood of $z$. We implement our algorithm and demonstrate the accuracy\nand robustness of our method using both synthetic and real data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 15:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}

The primary bow\nis the lowest-order bow that can occur by scattering from a spherical drop with\nconstant refractive index n, but zero-order (or direct transmission) bows can\nexist when the sphere is radially inhomogeneous. The refractive index profile\nautomatically defines a scattering potential, but with a significant difference\ncompared to the standard quantum mechanical form: the potential is k-dependent.\nA consequence of this is that there are no bound states for this system. The\ncorrespondences between the resonant modes in scattering by a potential of the\nwell-barrier type and the behavior of electromagnetic rays in a transparent (or\ndielectric) sphere are discussed. The poles and saddle points of the associated\nscattering matrix have quite profound connections to electromagnetic tunneling,\nresonances and bows arising within and from the sphere. The links between the\nvarious mathematical and physical viewpoints are most easily appreciated in the\ncase of constant n, thus providing insight into possible extensions to these\ndescriptions for bows of arbitrary order in radially inhomogeneous spheres (and\ncylinders).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 15:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}
