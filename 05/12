The striking action of a hammer or mallet in keyboard and\npercussion instruments is perhaps the most important example, but others\ninclude reed-beating effects in wind instruments, the string/neck interaction\nin fretted instruments such as the guitar as well as in the sitar and the\nwire/membrane interaction in the snare drum. From a simulation perspective,\nwhether the eventual goal is the validation of musical instrument models or\nsound synthesis, such highly nonlinear problems pose various difficulties, not\nthe least of which is the risk of numerical instability. In this article, a\nnovel finite difference time domain simulation framework for such collision\nproblems is developed, where numerical stability follows from strict numerical\nenergy conservation or dissipation, and where a a power law formulation for\ncollisions is employed, as a potential function within a Hamiltonian\nformulation. The power law serves both as a model of deformable collision, and\nas a mathematical penalty under perfectly rigid, non-deformable collision. This\nformulation solves a major problem underlying previous work, where a\nHamiltonian framework was not employed for collisions, and thus stability was\nnot ensured. Various numerical examples, illustrating the unifying features of\nsuch methods across a wide variety of systems in musical acoustics are\npresented, including numerical stability and energy conservation/dissipation,\nbounds on spurious penetration in the case of rigid collisions, as well as\nvarious aspects of musical instrument physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 May 2014 21:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-13"}

Optical images of the galaxy hinted at a warped disk in\ncontrast to the symmetric integrated HI spectrum profile. Our aim is to\ndetermine the extent to which the optical asymmetry is reflected in the\nresolved HI morphology and kinematics. GMRT observations reveal significant HI\nmorphological asymmetries in CIG 340 despite it's overall symmetric optical\nform and highly symmetric HI spectrum. The most notable HI features are: 1) a\nwarp in the HI disk (with an optical counterpart), 2) the HI north/south flux\nratio = 1.32 is much larger than expected from the integrated HI spectrum\nprofile and 3) a ~ 45\" (12 kpc) HI extension, containing ~ 6% of the detected\nHI mass on the northern side of the disk.

We have\nidentified the cold HI gas observed as self-absorption which shows significant\ncorrespondence with the northeastern gamma-ray peak. While the good\ncorrespondence between the interstellar protons and TeV gamma-rays in the north\nof the SNR lends support to the hadronic scenario for the TeV gamma-rays, the\nsouthern part of the shell shows a break in the correspondence; in particular,\nthe southwestern rim of the SNR shell shows a significant decrease of the\ninterstellar protons by a factor of 2. We argue that this discrepancy can be\nexplained as due to leptonic gamma-rays, because this region well coincides\nwith the bright shell which emit non-thermal radio continuum emission and\nnon-thermal X-rays, suggesting that the gamma-rays of HESS J1713-347 consist of\nboth the hadronic and leptonic components. The leptonic contribution then\ncorresponds to ~20 % of the total gamma-rays. The total energy of cosmic-ray\nprotons is estimated to be 10^49 erg for the gamma-ray energy range of 1 GeV -\n100 TeV by assuming that 80 % of the total gamma-ray is of the hadronic origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 May 2014 22:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

At room temperature and laboratory strain\nrates, the activation volume associated with yield is found to contain about 10\nLJ particles, while the yield stress is as sensitive to a $1.5\\%T_{\\rm g}$\nincrease in temperature as it is to a one order of magnitude decrease in strain\nrate. Moreover, our SLME results suggest the SLME and extrapolated results from\nMD simulations follow distinctly different energetic pathways during the\napplied shear deformation at low temperatures and experimental strain rates,\nwhich implies that extrapolation of the governing deformation mechanisms from\nMD strain rates to experimental may not be valid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 02:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-13"}

The spectroscopic discovery of\nfive galaxies at z=3.783+/-0.002 lying within 1 Mpc of one another led us to\nundertake a deep narrow- and broad-band imaging survey of the surrounding\nfield. Within a comoving volume of 72x72x25 Mpc^3, we have identified 65 Lyman\nalpha emitter (LAE) candidates at z=3.795+/-0.015, and four additional galaxies\nat z_spec=3.730,3.753,3.780,3.835. The galaxy distribution within the field is\nhighly non-uniform, exhibiting three large (~3-5x) overdensities separated by\n8-14 Mpc (physical) and possibly connected by filamentary structures traced by\nLAEs. The observed number of LAEs in the entire field is nearly twice the\naverage expected in field environments, based on estimates of the Lya\nluminosity function at these redshifts. We estimate that by z=0 the largest\noverdensity will grow into a cluster of mass 10^15 Msun; the two smaller\noverdensities will grow into clusters of mass (2-6)x10^14 Msun. The highest\nconcentration of galaxies is located at the southern end of the image,\nsuggesting that the current imaging may not map the true extent of the large\nscale structure. Finding three large protocluster candidates within a single\n0.3 deg^2 field is highly unusual; expectations from theory suggest that such\nalignments should occur less than 2% of the time. Searching for and\ncharacterizing such structures and accurately measuring their volume space\ndensity can therefore place constraints on the theory of structure formation.\nSuch regions can also serve as laboratories for the study of galaxy formation\nin dense environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 03:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The sequence of transition states may\nvary substantially from patient to patient, depending on how the regime plays\nout, and in practice there often are many possible counterfactual outcome\nsequences. For evaluating the regimes, the mean final overall time may be\nexpressed as a weighted average of the means of all possible sums of successive\ntransitions times. A common example arises in cancer therapies where the\ntransition times between various sequences of treatments, disease remission,\ndisease progression, and death characterize overall survival time. For the\ngeneral setting, we propose estimating mean overall outcome time by assuming a\nBayesian nonparametric regression model for the logarithm of each transition\ntime. A dependent Dirichlet process prior with Gaussian process base measure\n(DDP-GP) is assumed, and a joint posterior is obtained by Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) sampling. We provide general guidelines for constructing a prior\nusing empirical Bayes methods. We compare the proposed approach with inverse\nprobability of treatment weighting. These comparisons are done by simulation\nstudies of both single-stage and multi-stage regimes, with treatment assignment\ndepending on baseline covariates. The method is applied to analyze a dataset\narising from a clinical trial involving multi-stage chemotherapy regimes for\nacute leukemia. An R program for implementing the DDP-GP-based Bayesian\nnonparametric analysis is freely available at\nhttps://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/yxu/.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 07:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

Its quadratic time complexity, however, greatly hampers its\navailability to large-scale applications. To accelerate the MMD calculation, in\nthis study we propose an efficient method called FastMMD. The core idea of\nFastMMD is to equivalently transform the MMD with shift-invariant kernels into\nthe amplitude expectation of a linear combination of sinusoid components based\non Bochner's theorem and Fourier transform (Rahimi & Recht, 2007). Taking\nadvantage of sampling of Fourier transform, FastMMD decreases the time\ncomplexity for MMD calculation from $O(N^2 d)$ to $O(L N d)$, where $N$ and $d$\nare the size and dimension of the sample set, respectively. Here $L$ is the\nnumber of basis functions for approximating kernels which determines the\napproximation accuracy. For kernels that are spherically invariant, the\ncomputation can be further accelerated to $O(L N \\log d)$ by using the Fastfood\ntechnique (Le et al., 2013). The uniform convergence of our method has also\nbeen theoretically proved in both unbiased and biased estimates. We have\nfurther provided a geometric explanation for our method, namely ensemble of\ncircular discrepancy, which facilitates us to understand the insight of MMD,\nand is hopeful to help arouse more extensive metrics for assessing two-sample\ntest. Experimental results substantiate that FastMMD is with similar accuracy\nas exact MMD, while with faster computation speed and lower variance than the\nexisting MMD approximation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 08:20:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 12:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

It enables one to\ntake account of all mechanisms of wave scattering, both related to boundary\nroughness and to contacts between the wire rough section and the leads within\nthe same technical frameworks. The rough part of the conducting wire is shown\nto act as a mode-specific randomly modulated effective potential barrier whose\nheight is governed essentially by the asperity slope. The mean height of the\nbarrier specifies the number of conducting channels. Under relatively small\nasperity amplitude this number can take on arbitrary small values if the\nasperities are sufficiently sharp. The channel cut-off that arises when the\nasperity sharpness increases can be regarded as a kind of localization, which\nis not related to the disorder but rather is of entropic origin. The\nfluctuating part of the barrier results in two fundamentally different types of\nguided wave scattering, viz., inter- and intramode scattering. The intermode\nscattering is shown to be for the most part very strong except in the cases of\n(a) extremely smooth asperities, (b) excessively small length of the corrugated\nsegment, and (c) the asperities sharp enough for only one conducting channel to\nremain in the wire. Under strong intermode scattering, a new set of conducting\nchannels develops, which have the form of decoupled extended modes subject to\nindividual random potentials. In view of this fact, two transport regimes only\nare realizable in randomly corrugated multimode wires, specifically, the\nballistic and the localized regime, the latter characteristic of\none-dimensional random systems. Two kinds of localization are thus shown to\ncoexist in waveguide-like systems with randomly corrugated boundaries,\nspecifically, the entropic localization and the one-dimensional Anderson\nlocalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 10:30:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Aug 2014 17:40:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2015 18:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-02"}

The\nmodel of spin dependent tunneling followed by charge readout has been highly\nsuccessful in enabling spin qubit experiments in all-electrical, semiconductor\nbased quantum computing. As experiments grow more sophisticated, and head\ntowards multiple qubit architectures that enable small scale computation, it\nbecomes important to consider the charge read-out overhead. With this in mind,\nReilly et al. demonstrated a gate readout scheme in a GaAs double quantum dot\nthat removed the need for an external charge sensor. This readout, which\nachieved sensitivities of order me/$\\sqrt(Hz)$, was enabled by using a resonant\ncircuit to probe the complex radio-frequency polarisability of the double\nquantum dot. However, the ultimate performance of this technology and the noise\nsources that limit it remain to be determined. Here, we investigate a\ngate-based readout scheme using a radio-frequency resonant circuit strongly\ncoupled to a double quantum at the corner states of a silicon nanowire\ntransistor. We find a significantly improved charge sensitivity of 37\n$\\mu$e/$\\sqrt(Hz)$. By solving the dynamical master equation of the fast-driven\nelectronic transitions we quantify the noise spectral density and determine the\nultimate charge and phase sensitivity of gate-based read-out. We find\ncomparable performance to conventional charge sensors and fundamental limits of\norder ne/$\\sqrt(Hz)$ and $\\mu$rad/$\\sqrt(Hz)$, with the gate-based sensor\nimproving on standard detection for certain device parameters. Our results show\nthat, especially in state-of-the-art silicon qubit architectures, charge\ndetection by probing the complex polarisability has advantages in terms of\nreducing the readout overhead but also in terms of the absolute charge\nsensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 13:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-07"}

A\ngrating with a blaze angle of 2.1 deg. and pitch of 166.667 midron was\nconstructed on a roughly flat 10 mm x 10 mm substrate with a maximum thickness\nof 1 mm. To obtain high accuracy, the sample was fabricated on a ZnS\nmonocrystal using a high performance processing machine at Canon Inc. The\nsurface roughness measured with a microscope interferometer was 2.6 nm rms. The\nshape of the fabricated grating edges was examined with a scanning electron\nmicroscope. The diffraction efficiency was evaluated by optical experiments at\n{\\lambda} = 633 nm, 980 nm, and 1550 nm, and compared with the efficiencies\ncalculated using a Fourier Modal Method. The results showed that the\ndifferences between the diffraction efficiencies obtained from experiment and\nby calculation were between just 0.9 % and 2.4 %. We concluded that the quality\nof the fabricated ZnS grating was sufficiently high to provide excellent\ndiffraction efficiency for use in the infrared wavelength region.

It extends convex modeling with the notion of p-box to gain\nadditional quantifiable information on the data whereabouts. Unlike existing\napproaches, the p-box envelops an unknown probability instead of approximating\nits representation. The p-box bounds are uniform cumulative distribution\nfunctions (cdf) in order to employ linear computations in the probabilistic\ndomain.
