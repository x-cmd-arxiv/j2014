This is the first time\na sample including a significant number of M- and S-type stars is analysed\ntogether with a carbon-star sample of equal size, making it possible to\ninvestigate trends among the different types and establish evolutionary\neffects. The circumstellar 12CO/13CO abundance ratios are estimated through a\ndetailed radiative transfer analysis of single-dish radio line emission\nobservations. First, the 12CO radiative transfer is solved, assuming an\nabundance (dependent on the chemical type of the star), to give the physical\nparameters of the gas, i.e. mass-loss rate, gas expansion velocity, and gas\ntemperature distribution. Then, the 13CO radiative transfer is solved using the\nresults of the 12CO model giving the 13CO abundance. Finally, the 12CO/13CO\nabundance ratio is calculated. The circumstellar 12CO/13CO abundance ratio\ndiffers between the three spectral types. This is consistent with what is\nexpected from stellar evolutionary models assuming that the spectral types\nconstitute an evolutionary sequence; however, this is the first time this has\nbeen shown observationally for a relatively large sample covering all three\nspectral types. The median value of the 13CO abundance in the inner\ncircumstellar envelope is 1.6x10^-5, 2.3x10^-5, and 3.0x10^-5 for the M-type,\nS-type, and carbon stars of the sample, respectively, corresponding to\n12CO/13CO abundance ratios of 13, 26, and 34, respectively. Interestingly, the\nabundance ratio spread of the carbon stars is much larger than for the M- and\nS-type stars, even when excluding J-type carbon stars, in line with what could\nbe expected from evolution on the AGB. We find no correlation between the\nisotopologue ratio and the mass-loss rate, as would be expected if both\nincrease as the star evolves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 May 2014 16:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

Henize 2-10, NGC 4889,\nand NGC1277 are examples of SMBHs at least an order of magnitude more massive\nthan their host galaxy suggests. The dynamical effects of such ultramassive\ncentral black holes is unclear. Here, we perform direct N-body simulations of\nmergers of galactic nuclei where one black hole is ultramassive to study the\nevolution of the remnant and the black hole dynamics in this extreme regime. We\nfind that the merger remnant is axisymmetric near the center, while near the\nlarge SMBH influence radius, the galaxy is triaxial. The SMBH separation\nshrinks rapidly due to dynamical friction, and quickly forms a binary black\nhole; if we scale our model to the most massive estimate for the NGC1277 black\nhole, for example, the timescale for the SMBH separation to shrink from nearly\na kiloparsec to less than a parsec is roughly 10 Myr. By the time the SMBHs\nform a hard binary, gravitational wave emission dominates, and the black holes\ncoalesce in a mere few Myr. Curiously, these extremely massive binaries appear\nto nearly bypass the 3-body scattering evolutionary phase. Our study suggests\nthat in this extreme case, SMBH coalescence is governed by dynamical friction\nfollowed nearly directly by gravitational wave emission, resulting in an rapid\nand efficient SMBH coalescence timescale. We discuss the implications for\ngravitational wave event rates and hypervelocity star production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 May 2014 20:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Brain states departing from normal\nwaking consciousness are expected to be accompanied by alterations in the\naforementioned dynamics. In particular, the psychedelic experience produced by\npsilocybin (a substance found in `magic mushrooms`) is characterized by\nunconstrained cognition and profound alterations in the perception of time,\nspace and selfhood. Considering the spontaneous and subjective manifestation of\nthese effects, we hypothesize that neural correlates of the psychedelic\nexperience can be found in the dynamics and variability of spontaneous brain\nactivity fluctuations and connectivity, measurable with functional Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy subjects were scanned before, during\nand after intravenous infusion of psilocybin and an inert placebo.

Changes in BOLD signal\nspectral behavior (including spectral scaling exponents) affected exclusively\nhigher brain systems such as the default mode, executive control and dorsal\nattention networks. A novel framework enabled us to track different\nconnectivity states explored by the brain during rest. This approach revealed a\nwider repertoire of connectivity states post-psilocybin than during control\nconditions. Together, the present results provide a comprehensive account of\nthe effects of psilocybin on dynamical behaviour in the human brain at a\nmacroscopic level and may have implications for our understanding of the\nunconstrained, hyper-associative quality of consciousness in the psychedelic\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 05:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-03"}

We first analyze the convergence property of the algorithm and\nprovide explicit necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameters to\nguarantee synchronization. We then study the effect of noisy measurements\n(jitter) and frequency drift (wander) on the offsets and synchronization\nfrequency, and further optimize the parameter values to minimize their\nvariance.

Currently debated mechanisms range\nfrom peristaltic pumping to temperature sensing (thermotaxis) and direct\nresponse to fluid flow variations (rheotaxis), but little is known\nquantitatively about their relative importance. Here, we report the first\nquantitative experimental study of mammalian sperm rheotaxis.

Our measurements show that the interplay of fluid shear,\nsteric surface-interactions and chirality of the flagellar beat leads to a\nstable upstream spiraling motion of sperm cells, thus providing a generic and\nrobust rectification mechanism to support mammalian fertilisation. To\nrationalise these findings, we identify a minimal mathematical model that is\ncapable of describing quantitatively the experimental observations.

To make classification useful in practice, it is crucial\nto improve its accuracy while ensuring that it can run at big data scales. Many\napproaches use acoustic measures based on spectrogram-type data, such as the\nMel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features which represent a\nmanually-designed summary of spectral information. However, recent work in\nmachine learning has demonstrated that features learnt automatically from data\ncan often outperform manually-designed feature transforms. Feature learning can\nbe performed at large scale and \"unsupervised\", meaning it requires no manual\ndata labelling, yet it can improve performance on \"supervised\" tasks such as\nclassification. In this work we introduce a technique for feature learning from\nlarge volumes of bird sound recordings, inspired by techniques that have proven\nuseful in other domains. We experimentally compare twelve different feature\nrepresentations derived from the Mel spectrum (of which six use this\ntechnique), using four large and diverse databases of bird vocalisations, with\na random forest classifier. We demonstrate that MFCCs are of limited power in\nthis context, leading to worse performance than the raw Mel spectral data.\nConversely, we demonstrate that unsupervised feature learning provides a\nsubstantial boost over MFCCs and Mel spectra without adding computational\ncomplexity after the model has been trained. The boost is particularly notable\nfor single-label classification tasks at large scale. The spectro-temporal\nactivations learned through our procedure resemble spectro-temporal receptive\nfields calculated from avian primary auditory forebrain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 09:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-14"}

An s-link is a walk of length s such\nthat consecutive edges are different. The s-link graph of a given graph G is\nthe graph with vertices the s-links of G, and two vertices are adjacent if\ntheir corresponding s-links form an (s + 1)-link; Or equivalently, one\ncorresponding s-link can be shunted to the other in one step. For example, the\n1-link graph of G is the line graph of G.\n  We give a characterisation for link graphs, which leads to algorithmic\nsolutions to their recognition and determination problems, and implies that the\nrecognition problem belongs to NP. Moreover, based on a recursive structure of\nlinkgraphs, we obtain results about the chromatic number, Hadwiger number and\nisomorphism group of link graphs. We also obtain results about the uniqueness,\ntree-decomposition and better-quasi-ordering of the original graphs of a given\nlink graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 10:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}

Temporal\nchanges in users' content and network attributes have been well studied in\nliterature, however little research has explored temporal changes in profile\nattributes of online users. This work makes the first attempt to study changes\nto a unique profile attribute of a user - username and on a popular OSN which\nallows users to change usernames multiple times - Twitter. We collect, monitor\nand analyze 8.7 million Twitter users at macroscopic level and 10,000 users at\nmicroscopic level to understand username changing behavior. We find that around\n10% of monitored Twitter users opt to change usernames for possible reasons\nsuch as space gain, followers gain, and username promotion. Few users switch\nback to any of their past usernames, however prefer recently dropped usernames\nto switch back to. Users who change usernames are more active and popular than\nusers who don't. In-degree, activity and account creation year of users are\nweakly correlated with their frequency of username change. We believe that past\nusernames of a user and their associated benefits inferred from the past, can\nhelp Twitter to suggest its users a set of suitable usernames to change to.\nPast usernames may also help in other applications such as searching and\nlinking multiple OSN accounts of a user and correlating multiple Twitter\nprofiles to a single user.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 10:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}

We present ALMA observations of the HD 100546 disk which\nresolve the gas and dust structure at (sub)mm wavelengths. The CO emission (at\n345.795 GHz) originates from an extensive molecular disk (390+/-20 AU in\nradius) whereas the continuum emission is more compact (230+/-20 AU in radius)\nsuggesting radial drift of the mm-sized grains.

Assuming azimuthal symmetry, a single-component\npower-law model cannot reproduce the continuum visibilities.

In recent times, volumetric approaches in which the motion is captured\nfrom a number of cameras and a voxel-set representation of the body is built\nfrom the camera views, have gained ground due to attractive features such as\ninherent view-invariance and robustness to occlusions. Automatic, unsupervised\nsegmentation of moving bodies along entire sequences, in a temporally-coherent\nand robust way, has the potential to provide a means of constructing a\nbottom-up model of the moving body, and track motion cues that may be later\nexploited for motion classification. Spectral methods such as locally linear\nembedding (LLE) can be useful in this context, as they preserve \"protrusions\",\ni.e., high-curvature regions of the 3D volume, of articulated shapes, while\nimproving their separation in a lower dimensional space, making them in this\nway easier to cluster. In this paper we therefore propose a spectral approach\nto unsupervised and temporally-coherent body-protrusion segmentation along time\nsequences. Volumetric shapes are clustered in an embedding space, clusters are\npropagated in time to ensure coherence, and merged or split to accommodate\nchanges in the body's topology. Experiments on both synthetic and real\nsequences of dense voxel-set data are shown. This supports the ability of the\nproposed method to cluster body-parts consistently over time in a totally\nunsupervised fashion, its robustness to sampling density and shape quality, and\nits potential for bottom-up model construction\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 13:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-30"}

Its research has recently been advanced by atomic norm techniques\nwhich exploit signal sparsity, work directly on continuous frequencies, and\ncompletely resolve the grid mismatch problem of previous compressed sensing\nmethods. In this work we investigate the frequency recovery problem in the\npresence of multiple measurement vectors (MMVs) which share the same frequency\ncomponents, termed as joint sparse frequency recovery and arising naturally\nfrom array processing applications. To study the advantage of MMVs, we first\npropose an $\\ell_{2,0}$ norm like approach by exploiting joint sparsity and\nshow that the number of recoverable frequencies can be increased except in a\ntrivial case. While the resulting optimization problem is shown to be rank\nminimization that cannot be practically solved, we then propose an MMV atomic\nnorm approach that is a convex relaxation and can be viewed as a continuous\ncounterpart of the $\\ell_{2,1}$ norm method. We show that this MMV atomic norm\napproach can be solved by semidefinite programming. We also provide theoretical\nresults showing that the frequencies can be exactly recovered under appropriate\nconditions. The above results either extend the MMV compressed sensing results\nfrom the discrete to the continuous setting or extend the recent\nsuper-resolution and continuous compressed sensing framework from the single to\nthe multiple measurement vectors case.

The comparison is performed at a\nfixed false alarm rate and relies on Monte-carlo simulations of binary black\nhole coalescences for spinning, non-precessing systems with total mass 25-350\nsolar mass, which covers the parameter space of stellar mass and intermediate\nmass black hole binaries. We find that in the mass range of 25 -100 solar mass\nthe sensitive distance of the search, marginalized over source parameters, is\nbest with matched filtering to full waveform templates, to within 10 percent at\na false alarm rate of 3 events per year. In the mass range of 100-350 solar\nmass, the same comparison favors the morphology-independent excess power search\nto within 20 percent. The dependence on mass and spin is also explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 14:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-16"}

Any study of such processes requires the\ndiscovery and accurate modeling of their underlying reaction network. However,\nthis task is challenging due to the complexity in exploring all the possible\npathways and the high computational cost in accurately modeling a large number\nof reactions. Fortunately, very often these processes are dominated by only a\nlimited subset of the network's reaction pathways. In this work we propose a\nnovel computationally inexpensive method to identify and select the key\npathways of complex reaction networks, so that high-level ab-initio\ncalculations can be more efficiently targeted at these critical reactions. The\nmethod estimates the relative importance of the reaction pathways for given\nreactants by analyzing the accelerated evolution of hundreds of replicas of the\nsystem and detecting products formation. This acceleration-detection method is\nable to tremendously speed up the reactivity of uni- and bimolecular reactions,\nwithout requiring any previous knowledge of products or transition states.\nImportantly, the method is efficiently iterative, as it can be\nstraightforwardly applied for the most frequently observed products, therefore\nproviding an efficient algorithm to identify the key reactions of extended\nchemical networks. We verified the validity of our approach on three different\nsystems, including the reactivity of t-decalin with a methyl radical, and in\nall cases the expected behavior was recovered within statistical error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 15:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}

Therefore, it\nis desirable to stabilize this model of the radiation reaction for estimations.\nVia my recent research, I found a stabilized model of radiation reaction in\nquantum vacuum. This leads us to an updated Fletcher-Millikan's charge to mass\nratio including radiation, de/dm, derived as the 4th order tensor measure. In\nthis paper, I will discuss the latest update of the model and the ability of\nthe equation of motion with radiation reaction in quantum vacuum via\nphoton-photon scatterings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 15:49:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 11:52:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 03:35:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2014 22:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

A TCM $n\\otimes n$ is expressed in terms of the $n\\otimes n$-Gell-Mann\nmatrices. In order to generalize this expression to which of TCMs $n\\otimes p$,\nwe introduced what we call rectangle Gell-Mann matrices. The electric charge\noperator (ECO) for eight leptons and quarks of the Standard Model (SM) of a\nsame generation proposed by Zenczykowski is expressed in terms of the TCM\n$2\\otimes 2$. An ECO including all the fermions of the SM is constructed in\nterms of TCM $4\\otimes 4$. Then the eigenvalues of a TCM take sense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 11:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-30"}
