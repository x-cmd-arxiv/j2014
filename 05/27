A useful duality exists\nbetween post-selected ensembles and a consistent picture of acausal physics\nembodying the application of Novikov's consistency postulate to the\nwave-function of a time machine. A competing view applies this postulate to\ndensity matrices instead, but that lies outside the scope of this paper. To\nfind out the result of a measurement on a particular circuit, we consider a\nweighted distribution of histories between some initial and final time, such\nthat each individually obeys ordinary quantum mechanics. The weight of a\nparticular history is given by a joint distribution over the values of a part\nof the system dubbed the time machine, at two chosen times. In the dual\npost-selection picture the weight is simply the probability for the 'periodic\nbit' to satisfy the constraint, plus a small noise part, often assumed\nconstant, representing the error rate of the time machine's channel. The\nemerging bit is one of a Bell pair, its partner kept in reserve to test that\nthe bit entering the time machine later matches the one which emerged. This is\ndone by interfering the incoming bit with the reserve member of the pair and\nkeeping the experimental runs that interfere constructively. Noise can be\neffectively simulated by keeping a small proportion of runs that interfere\ndestructively, or by perturbing the reserve bit to decohere it by a similar\namount. Paradoxes remain but are tractable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 16:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}

This approach is inspired by exception\nhandling of programming languages, and lets a PEG define different kinds of\nfailure, with each ordered choice operator specifying which kinds it catches.\nLabeled failures give a way to annotate grammars for better error reporting, to\nexpress some of the error reporting strategies used by deterministic parser\ncombinators, and to encode predictive top-down parsing in a PEG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 17:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 13:24:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 15:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-14"}

Schrodinger proved that the optimal steering of the\ndensity between the two end points is effected by a multiplicative functional\ntransformation of the prior; this transformation represents an automorphism on\nthe space of probability measures and has since been studied by Fortet,\nBeurling and others. A similar question can be raised for processes evolving in\na discrete time and space as well as for processes defined over non-commutative\nprobability spaces. The present paper builds on earlier work by Pavon and\nTicozzi and begins with the problem of steering a Markov chain between given\nmarginals. Our approach is based on the Hilbert metric and leads to an\nalternative proof which, however, is constructive. More specifically, we show\nthat the solution to the Schrodinger bridge is provided by the fixed point of a\ncontractive map. We approach in a similar manner the steering of a quantum\nsystem across a quantum channel. We are able to establish existence of quantum\ntransitions that are multiplicative functional transformations of a given Kraus\nmap, but only for the case of uniform marginals. As in the Markov chain case,\nand for uniform density matrices, the solution of the quantum bridge can be\nconstructed from the fixed point of a certain contractive map. For arbitrary\nmarginal densities, extensive numerical simulations indicate that iteration of\na similar map leads to fixed points from which we can construct a quantum\nbridge.

Halo catalogs from N-body simulations have been used to estimate\nthe probability of Bullet-like clusters. However, due to simulation volume\neffects previous studies had to rely on a Gaussian extrapolation of the\npairwise velocity distribution to high velocities.

In quantum\noptics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown\nof quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently\nwell understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired\nquantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in\nquantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to\ndescribe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems\ngenerally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a\nmicroscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and\nmolecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of\nmany-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding\nof open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body\ncontext. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is\nthe quantum trajectories technique. This was developed as a numerical tool for\nstudying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework\nof continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large\nclasses of open quantum systems. We review the progress that has been made in\nstudying open many-body systems in the AMO context, focussing on the\napplication of ideas from quantum optics, and on the implementation and\napplications of quantum trajectories methods. Control over dissipative\nprocesses promises many further tools to prepare interesting and important\nstates in strongly interacting systems, including the realisation of parameter\nregimes in quantum simulators that are inaccessible via current techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 19:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-07"}

Our simulations are performed with\nthe Newtonian, Eulerian code FISH, augmented by a detailed, spectral neutrino\nleakage scheme that accounts for heating due to neutrino absorption in\noptically thin conditions. Consistent with the 2D study of Dessart et al.\n(2009), we find that a strong baryonic wind is blown out along the original\nbinary rotation axis within $100$ ms after the merger. We compute a lower limit\non the expelled mass of $3.5 \\times 10^{-3} M_{\\odot}$, large enough to be\nrelevant for heavy element nucleosynthesis. The physical properties vary\nsignificantly between different wind regions. For example, due to stronger\nneutrino irradiation, the polar regions show substantially larger $Y_e$ than\nthose at lower latitudes. This has its bearings on the nucleosynthesis: the\npolar ejecta produce interesting r-process contributions from $A\\sim 80$ to\nabout 130, while the more neutron-rich, lower-latitude parts produce also\nelements up to the third r-process peak near $A\\sim 195$. We also calculate the\nproperties of electromagnetic transients that are powered by the radioactivity\nin the wind, in addition to the macronova transient that stems from the dynamic\nejecta.

Direct collapse black holes (DCBH) that form in\npristine, atomic-line cooling halos, illuminated by a Lyman-Werner (LW) UV flux\nexceeding a critical threshold J_crit, represent an attractive possibility. We\ninvestigate when and where these conditions are met during cosmic evolution.\nFor the LW intensity, J_LW, we account for departures from the background value\nin close proximity to star forming galaxies. For the pristine halo fraction, we\naccount for both (i) supernova driven outflows, and (ii) the inherent pollution\nfrom progenitor halos. We estimate the abundance of DCBH formation sites,\nn_DCBH(z), and find that it increases with cosmic time from n_DCBH(z=20) ~\n1e-12 -1e-7 cMpc^-3 to n_DCBH(z=10) ~ 1e-10 - 1e-5 cMpc^-3. Our analysis shows\nthe possible importance of galactic winds, which can suppress the predicted\nn_DCBH by several orders of magnitude, and cause DCBH formation to\npreferentially occur around the UV-brightest (M_UV ~ -22 to -20) star forming\ngalaxies.

To this\nend we consider numerical simulations that cover the uppermost 2-6 Mm of the\nsolar convection zone and we explore scales ranging from 2 km to 25 Mm. We\nstudy how the strength and distribution of magnetic field in the photosphere\nand subsurface layers depend on resolution, domain size and boundary\nconditions. We find that 50% of the magnetic energy at the \\tau=1 level comes\nfrom field with the less than 500 G strength and that 50% of the energy resides\non scales smaller than about 100 km. While probability distribution functions\nare essentially independent of resolution, properly describing the spectral\nenergy distribution requires grid spacings of 8 km or smaller. The formation of\nflux concentrations in the photosphere exceeding 1 kG requires a mean vertical\nfield strength greater than 30-40 G at \\tau=1. The filling factor of kG flux\nconcentrations increases with overall domain size as magnetic field becomes\norganized by larger, longer lived flow structures. A solution with a mean\nvertical field strength of around 85 G at \\tau=1 requires a subsurface RMS\nfield strength increasing with depth at the same rate as the equipartition\nfield strength. We consider this an upper limit for the quiet Sun field\nstrength, which implies that most of the convection zone is magnetized close to\nequipartition.

The whole radio beam may consist of\nseveral sub-beams, forming a fan-shaped pattern. When only one or a few flux\ntubes are active, the fan beam becomes very patchy. This model differs\nessentially from the conal beam models in the respects of beam structure and\npredictions on the relationship between pulse width and impact angle $\\beta$\n(the angle between line of sight and magnetic pole) and the relationship\nbetween emission intensity and beam angular radius. The evidence for this model\ncomes from the observed patchy beams of precessional binary pulsars and three\nstatistical relationships found for a sample of 64 pulsars, of which $\\beta$\nwere mostly constrained by fitting polarization position angle data with the\nRotation Vector Model. With appropriate assumptions, the fan beam model can\nreproduce the relationship between 10\\% peak pulse width and $|\\beta|$, the\nanticorrelation between the emission intensity and $|\\beta|$, and the upper\nboundary line in the scatter plot of $|\\beta|$ versus pulsar distance.

The absence of intense heating within the first\ntwo hours after the onset of the prominence eruption, which followed an\nexponential increase in height, indicates that ideal instability played a\ncrucial role.

However,\nlittle work has been done in the robust coding of encrypted images. The\nexisting results in these two individual research areas cannot be combined\ndirectly for the robust coding of encrypted images. This is because the robust\ncoding of natural images relies on the elimination of spatial correlations\nusing sparse transforms such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT), which is\nineffective to encrypted images due to the weak correlation between encrypted\npixels. Moreover, the compression of encrypted images always generates code\nstreams with different significance. If one or more such streams are lost, the\nquality of the reconstructed images may drop substantially or decoding error\nmay exist, which violates the goal of robust coding of encrypted images. In\nthis work, we intend to design a robust coder, based on compressive sensing\nwith structurally random matrix, for encrypted images over packet transmission\nnetworks. The proposed coder can be applied in the scenario that Alice needs a\nsemi-trusted channel provider Charlie to encode and transmit the encrypted\nimage to Bob. In particular, Alice first encrypts an image using globally\nrandom permutation and then sends the encrypted image to Charlie who samples\nthe encrypted image using a structural matrix. Through an imperfect channel\nwith packet loss, Bob receives the compressive measurements and reconstructs\nthe original image by joint decryption and decoding. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed coder can be considered as an efficient multiple description\ncoder with a number of descriptions against packet loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2014 09:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-22"}

However, little attention has been paid to sampling from directed\nnetworks such as WWW and Peer-to-Peer networks. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel two-step (sampling/estimation) framework to measure nodal characteristics\nwhich can be defined by an average target function in an arbitrary directed\nnetwork. To this end, we propose a personalized PageRank-based algorithm to\nvisit and sample nodes. This algorithm only uses already visited nodes as local\ninformation without any prior knowledge about the latent structure of the\nnetwork. Moreover, we introduce a new estimator based on the approximate\nimportance sampling to estimate average target functions. The proposed\nestimator utilizes calculated PageRank value of each sampled node as an\napproximation for the exact visiting probability. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first study on correcting the bias of a sampling method by\nre-weighting of measured values that considers the effect of approximation of\nvisiting probabilities. Comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of the\nestimator demonstrate that it is asymptotically unbiased even in situations\nwhere stationary distribution of PageRank is poorly approximated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2014 09:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-28"}

The diffusion model\nis based on a central limit theorem for density dependent population processes,\nand we show that the sampling distribution is a linear combination of moments\nof Gaussian distributions and hence available in closed-form. The coalescent\nprocess is based on a probabilistic coupling of the ancestral recombination\ngraph to a simpler genealogical process which exposes the leading dynamics of\nthe former.

A broader class of signal-flow diagrams also includes \"caps\" and\n\"cups\" to model feedback. We show these diagrams can be seen as string diagrams\nfor the symmetric monoidal category FinRel_k, where objects are still\nfinite-dimensional vector spaces but the morphisms are linear relations. We\nalso give a presentation for FinRel_k. The relations say, among other things,\nthat the 1-dimensional vector space k has two special commutative\ndagger-Frobenius structures, such that the multiplication and unit of either\none and the comultiplication and counit of the other fit together to form a\nbimonoid. This sort of structure, but with tensor product replacing direct sum,\nis familiar from the \"ZX-calculus\" obeyed by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space\nwith two mutually unbiased bases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2014 12:15:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2015 02:17:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 18:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

Roughly, the idea of CPC\nconsists in embedding information (about a random state) into the transmit\npower levels themselves: in this new framework, provided the power levels of a\ngiven transmitter can be observed (through a noisy channels) by other\ntransmitters, a sequence of power levels of the former can therefore be used to\ncoordinate the latter. To assess the limiting performance of CPC (and therefore\nthe potential performance brought by this new approach), we derive, as a first\nstep towards many extensions of the present work, a general result which not\nonly concerns power control (PC) but also any scenario involving two\ndecision-makers (DMs) which communicate through their actions and have the\nfollowing information and decision structures. We assume that the DMs want to\nmaximize the average of an arbitrarily chosen instantaneous payoff function\nwhich depends on the DMs' actions and the state realization. DM 1 is assumed to\nknow non-causally the state (e.g., the channel state) which affects the common\npayoff while the other, say DM 2, has only a strictly causal knowledge of it.\nDM 1 can only use its own actions (e.g., power levels) to inform DM 2 about its\nbest action in terms of payoff. Importantly, DM 2 can only monitor the actions\nof DM 1 imperfectly and DM 1 does not observe DM 2. The latter assumption leads\nus to exploiting Shannon-theoretic tools in order to generalize an existing\ntheorem which provides the information constraint under which the payoff is\nmaximized. The derived result is then exploited to fully characterize the\nperformance of good CPC policies for a given instance of the interference\nchannel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2014 13:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-28"}

In this paper, we consider the case when $P$\n$k$-tiles $\\mathbb R^d$ with a discrete multiset $\\Lambda$ such that every\nelement of $\\Lambda$ is contained in a quasi-periodic set $\\mathcal Q$ (i.e. a\nfinite union of translated lattices). This is motivated by the result of\nGravin, Kolountzakis, Robins, and Shiryaev, showing that for $d \\in \\{2,3\\}$,\nif a polytope $P$ $k$-tiles $\\mathbb R^d$ with a discrete multiset $\\Lambda$,\nthen $P$ $m$-tiles $\\mathbb R^d$ with a quasi-periodic set $\\mathcal Q$ for\nsome $m$. Here we show for all values of $d$ that if a polytope $P$ $k$-tiles\n$\\mathbb R^d$ with a discrete multiset $\\Lambda$ that is contained in a\nquasi-periodic set $\\mathcal Q$ that satisfies a mild hypothesis, then $P$\n$m$-tiles $\\mathbb R^d$ with a lattice $\\mathcal L$ for some $m$. This\nstrengthens the results of Gravin, Kolountzakis, Robins, and Shiryaev, and is a\nstep in the direction of proving the conjecture of Gravin et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2014 14:28:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2015 17:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-25"}

The model is applied to two data sets on extreme\nprecipitation, one uncorrected data set and one data set that is corrected for\nphase and wind. The observations are assumed to follow the generalized extreme\nvalue distribution. At the latent level, we implement SPDE spatial models for\nboth the location and scale parameters of the likelihood. An efficient MCMC\nsampler which exploits the model structure is constructed, which yields fast\ncontinuous spatial predictions for spatially varying model parameters and\nquantiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2014 15:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In contrast to previous relevant\nworks, the fast fading MIMO channel matrix is assumed to have an arbitrary-rank\ndeterministic component as well as a Rayleigh-distributed random component. We\nderive tractable expressions for the achievable uplink rate in the\nlarge-antenna limit, along with approximating results that hold for any finite\nnumber of antennas. Based on these analytical results, we obtain the scaling\nlaw that the users' transmit power should satisfy, while maintaining a\ndesirable quality of service. In particular, it is found that regardless of the\nRicean $K$-factor, in the case of perfect CSI, the approximations converge to\nthe same constant value as the exact results, as the number of base station\nantennas, $M$, grows large, while the transmit power of each user can be scaled\ndown proportionally to $1/M$. If CSI is estimated with uncertainty, the same\nresult holds true but only when the Ricean $K$-factor is non-zero. Otherwise,\nif the channel experiences Rayleigh fading, we can only cut the transmit power\nof each user proportionally to $1/\\sqrt M$. In addition, we show that with an\nincreasing Ricean $K$-factor, the uplink rates will converge to fixed values\nfor both MRC and ZF receivers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2014 15:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}
