Molecular motors of the\nkinesin-8 protein family depolymerise microtubules in a length-dependent\nmanner, and experimental and theoretical evidence suggest a role for kinesin-8\nin the dynamic regulation of microtubules. However, so far the detailed\nmolecular mechanisms how these molecular motors interact with the growing\nmicrotubule tip remain elusive. Here we investigate two interaction scenarios\nfor kinesin-8 and the microtubule tip. We give a comprehensive analysis of\nregimes where length-regulation is possible and characterise how the stationary\nlength depends on the biochemical rates and the bulk concentrations of the\nvarious proteins. For a neutral scenario, where microtubules grow irrespective\nof whether the microtubule tip is occupied by a molecular motor, length\nregulation is possible only for a narrow range of biochemical rates and limited\nto small polymerisation rates. In contrast, for an inhibition scenario, where\nthe presence of a motor at the microtubule tip inhibits microtubule growth, the\nregime of length regulation is extremely broad and includes high growth rates.\nThese results also apply to situations where polymerising enzymes, like\nXMAP215, and kinesin-8 mutually exclude each other from the microtubule tip. We\nalso investigate the stochastic dynamics of the two scenarios. While for the\nneutral scenario length is tightly controlled, length dynamics is intermittent\nfor the inhibition scenario and exhibits extended periods of microtubule growth\nand shrinkage, reminiscent of microtubule dynamic instability. On a broader\nperspective, the set of models established in this work quite generally\nsuggests that mutual exclusion of molecules at the ends of cytoskeletal\nfilaments is an important factor for filament dynamics and regulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 18:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-29"}

While numerical simulations typically\nshow that spiral shocks are unstable to wiggle instability (WI) even in the\nabsence of magnetic fields and self-gravity, its physical nature has remained\nuncertain. To clarify the mechanism behind the WI, we conduct a normal-mode\nlinear stability analysis as well as nonlinear simulations assuming that the\ndisk is isothermal and infinitesimally thin. We find that the WI is physical,\noriginating from the generation of potential vorticity at a deformed shock\nfront, rather than Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities as previously thought. Since\ngas in galaxy rotation periodically passes through the shocks multiple times,\nthe potential vorticity can accumulate successively, setting up a normal mode\nthat grows exponentially with time. Eigenfunctions of the WI decay\nexponentially downstream from the shock front. Both shock compression of\nacoustic waves and a discontinuity of shear across the shock stabilize the WI.\nThe wavelength and growth time of the WI depend on the arm strength quite\nsensitively. When the stellar-arm forcing is moderate at 5%, the wavelength of\nthe most unstable mode is about 0.07 times the arm-to-arm spacing, with the\ngrowth rate comparable to the orbital angular frequency, which is found to be\nin good agreement with the results of numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

If non-Collapsar sGRBs arise\nfrom neutron star merger this rate suggest a detection rate of 3-100 yr^-1 by a\nfuture gravitational wave detectors (e.g. Advanced Ligo/Virgo with detection\nhorizon on 300 Mpc), and a co-detection with Fermi (Swift) rate of 0.1-1 yr^-1\n(0.02-0.14 yr^-1). We estimate that about 4 * 10^5 (f_b^-1 / 30) mergers took\nplace in the Milky Way. If $0.025 m_\\odot$ were ejected in each event this\nwould have been sufficient to produce all the heavy r-process material in the\nGalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 20:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 12:45:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 09:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

The 225 GHz continuum emission shows a weak (~23.6 mJy),\ncompact (<1000 AU) component associated with the central protostar. Our\nsimulated observations show that it can be explained by dust thermal emission\narising from an envelope which has a hole or a constant intensity region within\na few hundred AU of the protostar. This suggests the disappearance or a lower\nconcentration distribution of the envelope on a small scale. The 12CO and 13CO\nemission exhibit molecular outflows to the south and north. The C18O emission\nshows two molecular blobs, which correspond to the reflection nebulosity seen\nin near-infrared images, while there is no C18O emission associated with the\nprotostar. The near-infrared features are likely due to the scattering at the\npositions of the blobs. The visible scattering features should result from the\noptical thinness of the envelope material, which is consistent with the\nless-concentrated distribution in the continuum emission. From single-dish\nobservations, we found that the mass of the envelope (~1.5 Msun) + protostar\n(~0.5 Msun) is comparable with the virial mass of M_vir=1.0 Msun within 40\narcsec. This suggests that the envelope is likely gravitationally bound.

(This is a somewhat unusual problem, but it is useful for\nunderstanding the initial transient response of an algorithm for diffusion\nequations.) LDG uses an auxiliary variable to break this up into two first\norder equations and then applies techniques by analogy to DG algorithms for\nadvection algorithms. This introduces an asymmetry into the solution that\ndepends on the choice of upwind directions for these two first order equations.\nWhen using piecewise linear basis functions, this LDG solution $g_h$ is shown\nnot to converge in an $L_2$ norm because the slopes in each cell diverge.\nHowever, when LDG is used in a time-dependent diffusion problem, this error in\nthe second derivative term is transient and rapidly decays away, so that the\noverall error is bounded.

In this report we explore differences in cell\nactivity between successful and failed trials as the monkey learns during two\nsessions. The ability to directly compare data across multiple sessions is\nfairly new and until now research has mostly focused on the activity of neurons\nduring successful trials only. We confirm findings of the development of\ncoherently active cell assemblies and find that neural response differentiates\nsignificantly between successful and unsuccessful trials, particularly as the\nmonkey adapts to the task. Our findings motivate further research into the\ndifferences in activity between successful and unsuccessful trials in these\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 21:40:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-26"}

Several verification\nmethods were proposed, but they were based on ad-hoc, empirical assumptions,\nthus their performance is questionable. In this work we apply a conventional\nlikelihood method to measure a skill of forecast. The advantage of such an\napproach is that earthquake rate prediction can in principle be adequately\ncombined with focal mechanism forecast, if both are based on the likelihood\nscores, resulting in a general forecast optimization. To calculate the\nlikelihood score we need to compare actual forecasts or occurrences of\npredicted events with the null hypothesis that the mechanism's 3-D orientation\nis random. For double-couple source orientation the random probability\ndistribution function is not uniform, which complicates the calculation of the\nlikelihood value. To better understand the resulting complexities we calculate\nthe information (likelihood) score for two rotational distributions (Cauchy and\nvon Mises-Fisher), which are used to approximate earthquake source orientation\npattern. We then calculate the likelihood score for earthquake source forecasts\nand for their validation by future seismicity data. Several issues need to be\nexplored when analyzing observational results: their dependence on forecast and\ndata resolution, internal dependence of scores on forecasted angle, and random\nvariability of likelihood scores.

The functional conserved cores of modules, basal cell machinery, and a\nset of non-orthologous common physiological global responses were identified\nvia both orthologous genes and non-orthologous conserved functions. This study\nreveals novel common systems principles maintained between two phylogenetically\ndistant organisms and provides a comparison of their lifestyle adaptations. Our\nresults shed new light on the systems-level principles and the fundamental\nfunctions required by bacteria to sustain life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 00:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-26"}

Although extensive research on novel efficient walking algorithms\nhas been conducted, falls commonly appear as the walking speed increases or as\nthe terrain condition changes. This paper presents a polynomial trajectory\ngeneration algorithm (PTA) to implement the walking on biped robots following\nthe cubic Hermitian polynomial interpolation between initial and final\nconditions. The proposed algorithm allows smooth transitions between walking\nphases, significantly reducing the possibility of falling. The algorithm has\nbeen successfully tested by generating walking trajectories under different\nterrain conditions on a biped robot of 10 DOFs. PTA has shown to be simple and\nsuitable to generate real time walking trajectories, despite reduced computing\nresources of a commercial embedded microcontroller.

Here, we unravel the TRN of Escherichia coli by\nseparating it into its key elements, thus revealing its natural organization.\nWe also present a mathematical criterion, based on the topological features of\nthe TRN, to classify the network elements into one of two possible classes:\nhierarchical or modular genes.\n  Results: We found that modular genes are clustered into physiologically\ncorrelated groups validated by a statistical analysis of the enrichment of the\nfunctional classes.

The system under\nconsideration is one-dimensional and consists of a particle coupled to a von\nNeumann apparatus that measures its position. The particle moves in a quadratic\npotential; in particular we consider a driven harmonic oscillator. The real\nline is divided into intervals of the same length, and coarse-grained histories\nare defined by the arithmetic average of the initial and final position of the\nparticle to be within one of these intervals. The position of the pointer\ncorrelates with this arithmetic average. In addition a constant term is added\nto this average, which is a result of the presence of a driving force on the\noscillator. We investigate decoherence for such histories via the decoherence\nfunctional for the particle-apparatus. An exact expression for this functional\nhas been derived. If the particle or the pointer of the apparatus is in an\nexact position state initially, then exact decoherence ensues, and the relative\nprobability for such histories is obtained. If the initial state of the\nparticle, which is centered at some arbitrary point in the $x$-axis, is narrow\ncompared to the width of the intervals on the $x$-axis, then we obtain\napproximate decoherence. The same result follows if the initial state of the\npointer is narrow. In these two situations, we evaluate expressions for the\ndecoherence functional qualitatively and quantitatively. In the latter case we\nobtain the first two terms in an expansion in powers of the width of the\ninitial state of the particle or the pointer respectively.

In this problem, $n$ candidates are evenly\ndistributed into $Q$ queues, and instead of hiring the best one, the employer\nwants to hire $J$ candidates among the best $K$ persons.

This phenomenon is observed not\nonly in astrophysical scenarios such as the propagation of supernova remnant\n(SNR) blast shells into the interstellar medium, but also in laboratory-based\nlaser-plasma experiments. These experiments and supporting simulations are thus\nseen as an attractive platform for the small-scale reproduction and study of\nastrophysical shocks in the laboratory. We model two plasma clouds, which\nconsist of electrons and ions, with a 2D PIC simulation. The ion temperatures\nof both clouds differ by a factor of 10. Both clouds collide at a speed, which\nis realistic for laboratory studies and for SNR shocks in their late evolution\nphase like that of RCW86. A magnetic field, which is orthogonal to the\nsimulation plane, has a strength that is comparable to that at SNR shocks. A\nforward shock forms between the overlap layer of both plasma clouds and the\ncloud with the cooler ions. A large-amplitude ion acoustic wave is observed\nbetween the overlap layer and the cloud with the hotter ions. It does not\nsteepen into a reverse shock, because its speed is below the ion acoustic\nspeed. A gradient of the magnetic field amplitude builds up close to the\nforward shock as it compresses the magnetic field. This gradient gives rise to\nan electron drift that is fast enough to trigger an instability. Electrostatic\nion acoustic wave turbulence develops ahead of the shock. It widens its\ntransition layer and thermalizes the ions, but the forward shock remains\nintact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 08:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

There is no established astrophysical explanation for\ntheir origin and considerations have been made in the literature that those\nmassive black holes (MBHs) may be primordial black holes (PBHs), black holes\nwhich are formed in the early universe (well before the matter-radiation\nequality) due to the direct collapse of primordial overdensities. This paper\naims at discussing the possibility of excluding the PBH scenario as the origin\nof the MBHs. We first revisit the constraints on PBHs obtained from the CMB\ndistortion that the seed density perturbation causes. By adopting a recent\ncomputation of the CMB distortion sourced by the seed density perturbation and\nthe stronger constraint on the CMB distortion set by the COBE/FIRAS experiment\nused in the literature, we find that PBHs in the mass range $6\\times\n10^4~M_\\odot \\sim 5 \\times 10^{13}~M_\\odot$ are excluded. Since PBHs lighter\nthan $6 \\times 10^4~M_\\odot$ are not excluded from the non-observation of the\nCMB distortion, we propose a new method which can potentially exclude smaller\nPBHs as well. Based on the observation that large density perturbations\nrequired to create PBHs also result in the copious production of ultracompact\nminihalos (UCMHs), compact dark matter halos formed at around the\nrecombination, we show that weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) as\ndark matter annihilate efficiently inside UCMHs to yield cosmic rays far\nexceeding the observed flux. Our bound gives severe restriction on the\ncompatibility between the particle physics models for WIMPs and the PBH\nscenario as the explanation of MBHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 09:29:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 06:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-17"}

The former is the minimum size of the initially shared state $\\sigma$\non which local operations by the two parties (without communication) can\ngenerate the target state $\\rho$, and the latter is the minimum amount of\ncommunication needed when initially sharing nothing. In this paper, we\ngeneralize these two concepts to multipartite cases, for both exact and\napproximate state generation. Our results are summarized as follows. (1) For\nmultipartite pure states, the correlation complexity can be completely\ncharacterized by local ranks of sybsystems. (2) We extend the notion of\nPSD-rank of matrices to that of tensors, and use it to bound the quantum\ncorrelation complexity for generating multipartite classical distributions. (3)\nFor generating multipartite mixed quantum states, communication complexity is\nnot always equal to correlation complexity (as opposed to bipartite case). But\nthey differ by at most a factor of 2. Generating a multipartite mixed quantum\nstate has the same communication complexity as generating its optimal\npurification. But for correlation complexity of these two tasks can be\ndifferent (though still related by less than a factor of 2). (4) To generate a\nbipartite classical distribution $P(x,y)$ approximately, the quantum\ncommunication complexity is completely characterized by the approximate\nPSD-rank of $P$. The quantum correlation complexity of approximately generating\nmultipartite pure states is bounded by approximate local ranks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 10:36:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 05:43:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2014 01:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-21"}

We focus on their secular evolution due to the perturbation by the\nMBH, while simplistically accounting for their collisional evolution. Binaries\nwith highly inclined orbits in respect to their orbit around the MBH are\nstrongly affected by secular processes, which periodically change their\neccentricities and inclinations (e.g. Kozai--Lidov cycles). During periapsis\napproach, dissipative processes such as tidal friction may become highly\nefficient, and may lead to shrinkage of a binary orbit and even to its merger.\nBinaries in this environment can therefore significantly change their orbital\nevolution due to the MBH third-body perturbative effects. Such orbital\nevolution may impinge on their later stellar evolution. Here we follow the\nsecular dynamics of such binaries and its coupling to tidal evolution, as well\nas the stellar evolution of such binaries on longer time-scales. We find that\nstellar binaries in the central parts of NSCs are highly likely to evolve into\neccentric and/or short period binaries, and become strongly interacting\nbinaries either on the main sequence (at which point they may even merge), or\nthrough their later binary stellar evolution. The central parts of NSCs\ntherefore catalyze the formation and evolution of strongly interacting\nbinaries, and lead to the enhanced formation of blue stragglers, X-ray\nbinaries, gravitational wave sources and possible supernova progenitors.\nInduced mergers/collisions may also lead to the formation of G2-like cloud-like\nobjects such as the one recently observed in the Galactic center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 11:42:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 04:02:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Using a 1D hydrodynamic code for both flares the energy deposited\nin the chromosphere was derived applying RHESSI observational data. The use of\nthe Fokker-Planck formalism permits the calculation of distributions of the\nNTEs in flaring loops, thus spatial distributions of the X-ray non-thermal\nemissions and integral fluxes for the selected energy ranges which were\ncompared with the observed ones. The best compatibility of the model with the\nobservations was obtained for the June 2nd, 2002 event in both the 0.5-4 A GOES\nrange and total fluxes in the 6-12 keV, 12-25 keV, 20-25 keV and 50- 100 keV\nenergy bands. Results of photometry of the individual flaring structures in a\nhigh energy range shows that the best compliance occurred for the June 2nd,\n2002 flare, where the synthesized emissions were 30% or more higher than the\nobserved emissions.

Several factors may be important in promoting or mitigating ice\nformation. As a start, here we examine the effect of surface texture alone. We\ntested four candidate surfaces, inspired by hard-shelled marine invertebrates\nand constructed using a three-dimensional printing process. We screened\nbiological and artifical samples for ice formation and accretion in submerged\nconditions using previous methods, and developed a new test to examine ice\nformation from surface droplets as might be encountered in environments with\nmoist, cold air. It appears surface texture plays only a small role in delaying\nthe onset of ice formation: a stripe feature (corresponding to patterning found\non valves of blue mussels, Crassostrea gigas, or on the spines of the Antarctic\nsea urchin, Sterechinus neumayeri) slowed ice formation an average of 25%\ncompared to a grid feature (corresponding to patterning found on sub-polar\nbutterclams, Saxidomas). The geometric dimensions of the features have only a\nsmall (~6%) effect on ice formation.

Rev.} {\\bf D89},\n023520 (2014). It is investigated here how the luminosity distance -- redshift\nrelation $D_L(z)$ of the $\\Lambda$CDM model is duplicated in the Lema\\^{\\i}tre\n-- Tolman (L--T) model with $\\Lambda = 0$, constant bang-time function $t_B$\nand the energy function $E(r)$ mimicking accelerated expansion on the\nobserver's past light cone ($r$ is a uniquely defined comoving radial\ncoordinate). Numerical experiments show that $E > 0$ necessarily. The functions\n$z(r)$ and $E(r)$ are numerically calculated from the initial point at the\nobserver's position; then backward from the initial point at the apparent\nhorizon (AH). Reconciling the results of the two calculations allows one to\ndetermine the values of $E/r^2$ at $r = 0$ and at the AH. The problems\nconnected with continuing the calculation through the AH are discussed in\ndetail and solved. Then $z(r)$ and $E(r)$ are continued beyond the AH, up to\nthe numerical crash that signals the contact of the light cone with the Big\nBang. Similarly, the light cone of the L--T model is calculated by proceeding\nfrom the two initial points, and compared with the $\\Lambda$CDM light cone. The\nmodel constructed here contains shell crossings, but they can be removed by\nmatching the L--T region to a Friedmann background, without causing any\nconflict with the type Ia supernovae observations. The mechanism of imitating\nthe accelerated expansion by the $E(r)$ function is explained in a descriptive\nway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 14:04:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 15:06:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

We also simulate the structural change by adding the $\\Lambda$\nparticle, by varying the $\\Lambda N$ interaction artificially. As the increase\nof the $\\Lambda N$ interaction, the $\\Lambda$ particle gets to move more deeply\ninside the core and invokes strongly the spatial core shrinkage, and\naccordingly distinct localized $2\\alpha$ clusters appear in the nucleonic\nintrinsic density, though in ${^{8}{\\rm Be}}$ rather gaslike $2\\alpha$-cluster\nstructure is shown.

It is energized by one of the\nhighest spin-down power pulsars known (5% of Crab pulsar) and it has been\ncompared to the Crab Nebula due to their morphological similarities. This\nobject was previously observed by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes\n(Whipple, VERITAS and MAGIC), although not detected, with an upper limit of\n2.4% Crab Unit (C.U.) at VHE. It was detected by Fermi-LAT with a spectrum\nextending beyond 100 GeV. We analyzed 81 hours of 3C 58 data taken with the\nMAGIC telescopes and we detected VHE gamma-ray emission with a significance of\n5.7 sigma and an integral flux of 0.65% C.U. above 1 TeV.

At shorter times the higher\noperation speed has to be paid with a loss of fidelity. Here we quantify the\ntrade-off between the fidelity and the duration in a system driven by a\ntime-varying control. The problem is addressed in the framework of Hilbert\nspace geometry offering an intuitive interpretation of optimal control\nalgorithms. This approach is applied to non-uniform time variations which leads\nto a necessary criterion for control optimality applicable as a measure of\nalgorithm convergence. The time fidelity trade-off expressed in terms of the\ndirect Hilbert velocity provides a robust prediction of the quantum speed limit\nand allows to adapt the control optimization such that it yields a predefined\nfidelity. The results are verified numerically in a multilevel system with a\nconstrained Hamiltonian, and a classification scheme for the control sequences\nis proposed based on their optimizability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 14:40:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2015 07:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}

Our catalogue of phrases is limited to a small\nsublanguage. The reduction of daily translation costs is expected to offset the\ninitial development costs within a few years. After being operational for two\nwinter seasons, we assess here the quality of the produced texts based on an\nevaluation where participants rate real danger descriptions from both origins,\nthe catalogue of phrases versus the manually written and translated texts. With\na mean recognition rate of 55%, users can hardly distinguish between the two\ntypes of texts, and give similar ratings with respect to their language\nquality. Overall, the output from the catalogue system can be considered\nvirtually equivalent to a text written by avalanche forecasters and then\nmanually translated by professional translators.

To overcome the mechanical challenges of\nconstruction, an innovative light collection geometry has been pioneered, that\nminimises the complexity of construction. First test results are presented,\ndemonstrating a successful signal extraction. The geometry consists of a\nsampling calorimeter with passive absorber layers interleaved with layers of an\nactive medium made of inorganic scintillating crystals. Wavelength-shifting\n(WLS) fibres run along the four long, chamfered edges of the stack,\ntransporting the light to photodetectors at the rear. To maximise the amount of\nscintillation light reaching the WLS fibres, the scintillator chamfers are\ndepolished. It is shown herein that this concept is working for cerium fluoride\n(CeF$_3$) as a scintillator. Coupled to it, several different types of\nmaterials have been tested as WLS medium. In particular, materials that might\nbe sufficiently resistant to the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider\nradiation environment, such as cerium-doped Lutetium-Yttrium Orthosilicate\n(LYSO) and cerium-doped quartz, are compared to conventional plastic WLS\nfibres.

Moreover, the resulting phylogenetic\ndata provide an explicit historical perspective that critically informs\nresearch in a vast and growing number of scientific disciplines. One such use\nis the study of changes in rates of lineage diversification (speciation -\nextinction) through time.
