Heating parallel to the local magnetic field\nduring reconnection with a guide field is strongly reduced compared with the\nreconnection of anti-parallel magnetic fields. The dominant heating of thermal\nions during guide field reconnection results from pickup behavior of ions\nduring their entry into reconnection exhausts and dominantly produces heating\nperpendicular rather than parallel to the local magnetic field. Pickup behavior\nrequires that the ion transit time across the exhaust boundary (with a\ntransverse scale of the order of the ion sound Larmor radius) be short compared\nwith the ion cyclotron period. This translates into a threshold in the strength\nof reconnecting magnetic field that favors the heating of ions with high\nmass-to-charge. A simulation with a broad initial current layer produces a\nreconnecting system in which the amplitude of the reconnecting magnetic field\njust upstream of the dissipation region increases with time as reconnection\nproceeds. The sharp onset of perpendicular heating when the pickup threshold is\ncrossed is documented. A comparison of the time variation of the parallel and\nperpendicular ion heating with that predicted based on the strength of the\nreconnecting field establishes the scaling of ion heating with ambient\nparameters both below and above the pickup threshold.

Our results suggest that our method is robust for identifying\nmetastable states in complex time series, even when introducing considerable\nlevels of noise and missing data points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 17:38:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 10:45:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 16:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

The corresponding outputs are then characterized by quantum\nstate tomography (QST), which itself requires the measurement of non-commuting\nobservables realized by independent experiments on identically prepared system\nstates. Thus QPT procedure demands a number of independent measurements, and\nmoreover, this number increases rapidly with the size of the system. However,\nthe total number of independent measurements can be greatly reduced with the\navailability of ancilla qubits. Ancilla assisted process tomography (AAPT) has\nearlier been shown to require a single QST of system-ancilla space. Ancilla\nassisted quantum state tomography (AAQST) has also been shown to perform QST in\na single measurement. Here we combine AAPT with AAQST to realize a `single-shot\nQPT' (SSPT), a procedure to characterize a general quantum process in a single\ncollective measurement of a set of commuting observables. We demonstrate\nexperimental SSPT by characterizing several single-qubit processes using a\nthree-qubit NMR quantum register.

For a given cosmological model, one can obtain\nindependent information on nuclear processes in the energy range relevant for\nBBN, which determine the eventual ^2H/H yield. In particular, assuming the\nstandard cosmological model, we show that a combined analysis of Planck data\nand of recent deuterium abundance measurements in metal-poor damped Lyman-alpha\nsystems provides independent information on the cross section of the radiative\ncapture reaction d(p,\\gamma)^3He converting deuterium into helium.\nInterestingly, the result is higher than the values suggested by a fit of\npresent experimental data in the BBN energy range (10 - 300 keV), whereas it is\nin better agreement with ab initio theoretical calculations, based on models\nfor the nuclear electromagnetic current derived from realistic interactions.\nDue to the correlation between the rate of the above nuclear process and the\neffective number of neutrinos Neff, the same analysis points out a Neff>3 as\nwell. We show how this observation changes when assuming a non-minimal\ncosmological scenario. We conclude that further data on the d(p,\\gamma)^3He\ncross section in the few hundred keV range, that can be collected by\nexperiments like LUNA, may either confirm the low value of this rate, or rather\ngive some hint in favour of next-to-minimal cosmological scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 19:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-06"}

However, these\nexpectations are in conflict with observations for a non-negligible fraction of\nsGRB afterglows. In particular, the onset of the afterglow phase for some of\nthese events appears to be delayed and, in addition, a few of them exhibit\nlate- time rapid fading in their lightcurves.

We demonstrate\nthat the spin-controlled $0$-$\\pi$ profiles trace back to the proximity induced\nodd-frequency superconducting correlations generated by the ferromagnetic\nlayers. It is also shown that the spin-switching effect can be more pronounced\nin $SFSFFS$ structures. The current-phase relations reveal the important role\nof the middle $S$ electrode, where the spin controlled supercurrent depends\ncrucially on its thickness and phase differences with the outer $S$ terminals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 20:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-13"}

Correlated interference results when the incident and reflected\nparticle substates and their associated mirror substates overlap. Using the\nCopenhagen interpretation of measurement, an asynchronous joint probability\ndensity (PDF), which is a function both of the different positions and\ndifferent times at which the particle and mirror are measured, is derived\nassuming that no interaction occurs between each measurement. Measurement of\nthe particle first, in the correlated interference region, results in a\nsplitting of the mirror substate into ones which have and have not reflected\nthe particle. An analog of the interference from the Doppler effect for only\nmeasurements of the particle (a marginal PDF), in this two-body system, is\nshown to be a consequence of the asynchronous measurement.

When the new\ninformation comes in the form of a report from another agent, then it is clear\nthat we must first determine whether or not that agent should be trusted. In\nthis paper, we provide a formal approach to modeling trust as a pre-processing\nstep before belief revision. We emphasize that trust is not simply a relation\nbetween agents; the trust that one agent has in another is often restricted to\na particular domain of expertise. We demonstrate that this form of trust can be\ncaptured by associating a state-partition with each agent, then relativizing\nall reports to this state partition before performing belief revision. In this\nmanner, we incorporate only the part of a report that falls under the perceived\ndomain of expertise of the reporting agent. Unfortunately, state partitions\nbased on expertise do not allow us to compare the relative strength of trust\nheld with respect to different agents. To address this problem, we introduce\npseudometrics over states to represent differing degrees of trust. This allows\nus to incorporate simultaneous reports from multiple agents in a way that\nensures the most trusted reports will be believed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 21:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-02"}

In this\nconstruction, one starts from a flat torus with $16$ orbifold points, and\nresolves the orbifold singularities by gluing in $16$ small Eguchi-Hanson\nmanifolds which all have the same orientation. This construction was carried\nout rigorously by Topiwala, LeBrun-Singer, and Donaldson.\n  In 1981, Page asked whether the above construction can be modified by\nreversing the orientations of some of the Eguchi-Hanson manifolds. This is a\nsubtle question: if successful, this construction would produce Einstein\nmetrics which are neither K\\\"ahler nor self-dual.\n  In this paper, we focus on a configuration of maximal symmetry involving $8$\nsmall Eguchi-Hanson manifolds of each orientation which are arranged according\nto a chessboard pattern. By analyzing the interactions between Eguchi-Hanson\nmanifolds with opposite orientation, we identify a non-vanishing obstruction to\nthe gluing problem, thereby destroying any hope of producing a metric of zero\nRicci curvature in this way. Using this obstruction, we are able to understand\nthe dynamics of such metrics under Ricci flow as long as the Eguchi-Hanson\nmanifolds remain small. In particular, for the configuration described above,\nwe obtain an ancient solution to the Ricci flow with the property that the\nmaximum of the Riemann curvature tensor blows up at a rate of\n$(-t)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$, while the maximum of the Ricci curvature converges to\n$0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 23:29:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 17:32:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 00:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-06"}

Our work incorporates internal\ncontributions to the surface stress from both liquid/solid $\\Sigma_{ls}$ and\nsolid/gas $\\Sigma_{sg}$ solid surface tensions (surface stress), which results\nin a non-standard boundary-value problem that we solve using a dual integral\nequation. We compare our results to relevant experiments and conclude that the\ngeneralization of solid surface tension $\\Sigma_{ls} \\neq \\Sigma_{sg}$ is an\nessential feature in any model of partial-wetting. The comparisons also allow\nus to systematically eliminate some proposed contact-line models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 00:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-02"}

On the other hand, new high resolution observations of\nthe corona indicate that its magnetic field may tend to organise itself in fine\nstrand-like structures of few hundred kilometres widths. The link between small\nstructure in models and the observed widths of strand-like structure several\norders of magnitude larger is still not clear. A popular theoretical scenario\nis the nanoflare model, in which each strand is the product of an ensemble of\nheating events. Here, we suggest an alternative mechanism for strand\ngeneration. Through forward modelling of 3D MHD simulations we show that small\namplitude transverse MHD waves can lead in a few periods time to strand-like\nstructure in loops in EUV intensity images. Our model is based on previous\nnumerical work showing that transverse MHD oscillations can lead to\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities that deform the cross-sectional area of loops.\nWhile previous work has focused on large amplitude oscillations, here we show\nthat the instability can occur even for low wave amplitudes for long and thin\nloops, matching those presently observed in the corona. We show that the\nvortices generated from the instability are velocity sheared regions with\nenhanced emissivity hosting current sheets. Strands result as a complex\ncombination of the vortices and the line-of-sight angle, last for timescales of\na period and can be observed for spatial resolutions of a tenth of loop radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 01:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Rall \\cite{BKR2010}) consists of two players, Dominator and\nStaller, who take turns choosing a vertex from $G$ such that whenever a vertex\nis chosen by either player, at least one additional vertex is dominated.\nDominator wishes to dominate the graph in as few steps as possible, and Staller\nwishes to delay this process as much as possible. The game domination number\n$\\gamma _{{\\small g}}(G)$ is the number of vertices chosen when Dominator\nstarts the game; when Staller starts, it is denoted by $\\gamma _{{\\small\ng}}^{\\prime }(G).$\n  In this paper, the domination game on line graph $L\\left(\nK_{\\overline{m}}\\right) $ of complete multipartite graph $K_{\\overline{m}}$\n$(\\overline{m}\\equiv (m_{1},...,m_{n})\\in \\mathbb{N} ^{n})$ is considered, the\nexact values for game domination numbers are obtained and optimal strategy for\nboth players is described.

Shear Reynolds\nnumbers of up to $3\\cdot10^5$, corresponding to Taylor numbers of\n$Ta=4.6\\cdot10^{10}$, were reached. Effective scaling laws for the torque are\npresented. The transition to the ultimate regime, in which asymptotic scaling\nlaws (with logarithmic corrections) for the torque are expected to hold up to\narbitrarily high driving, is analysed for different radius ratios $\\eta$,\ndifferent aspect ratios $\\Gamma$ and different rotation ratios $Ro$. It is\nshown that the transition is approximately independent of $Ro$ and $\\Gamma$,\nbut depends significantly on $\\eta$. We furthermore calculate the local angular\nvelocity profiles and visualize different flow regimes that depend both on the\nshearing of the flow, and the Coriolis force originating from the outer\ncylinder rotation. Two main regimes are distinguished, based on the magnitude\nof the Coriolis force, namely the co-rotating and weakly counter-rotating\nregime dominated by Rayleigh-unstable regions, and the strongly\ncounter-rotating regime where a mixture of stable and unstable regions exist.\nFurthermore, an analogy between $\\eta$ and outer-cylinder rotation is revealed,\nnamely that smaller gaps behave like a wider gap with co-rotating cylinders,\nand that wider gaps behave like smaller gaps with weakly counter-rotating\ncylinders. Finally, the effect of $\\Gamma$ on the effective torque versus $Ta$\nscaling is analysed and it is shown that different branches of the\ntorque-versus-$Ta$ relationships associated to different aspect ratios are\nfound to cross within $15%$ of the $Re$ associated to the transition to the\nultimate regime.

First we show that the only correct\nway to locate a convective zone boundary is to find, at each iteration step,\nthrough interpolations or extrapolations from points $\\textit{within the\nconvective zone}$, the mass where the radiative luminosity is equal to the\ntotal one.

This is needed in\norder to minimize or even avoid the formation of grain boundaries which can be\ndetrimental to electrical, optical and mechanical properties of MoS2 and other\n2D semiconductors.

The coupling of $p$ modes and sausage tube waves is studied in a model\natmosphere composed of a polytropic interior above which lies an isothermal\nupper atmosphere. The sausage tube waves, excited by $p$ modes, propagate along\na magnetic fibril which is assumed to be a vertically aligned, stratified, thin\nmagnetic flux-tube. The deficit of $p$-mode energy is quantified through the\ndamping rate, $\\Gamma$ and absorption coefficient, $\\alpha$. The variation of\n$\\Gamma$ and $\\alpha$ as a function of frequency and the tube's plasma\nproperties is studied in detail. Previous similar studies have considered only\na subphotospheric layer, modelled as a polytrope that has been truncated at the\nphotosphere (Bogdan et al. (1996), Hindman & Jain 2008, Gascoyne et al.\n(2011)). Such studies have found that the resulting energy loss by the $p$\nmodes is very sensitive to the upper boundary condition, which because of the\nlack of a upper atmosphere have been imposed in a somewhat ad hoc manner. The\nmodel presented here avoids such problems by using an isothermal layer to model\nthe overlying atmosphere (chromosphere), and consequently, allows us to analyse\nthe propagation of $p$-mode driven sausage waves above the photosphere. In this\npaper we restrict our attention to frequencies below the acoustic cut-off\nfrequency.

In this paper, we propose to\nlearn the distance function directly on the manifold without embedding. We\nfirst provide a theoretical characterization of the distance function by its\ngradient field. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose to first learn\nthe gradient field of the distance function and then learn the distance\nfunction itself. Specifically, we set the gradient field of a local distance\nfunction as an initial vector field. Then we transport it to the whole manifold\nvia heat flow on vector fields. Finally, the geodesic distance function can be\nobtained by requiring its gradient field to be close to the normalized vector\nfield.

Motivated\nby statistical analysis, we assume that the service times are a mixture of a\nphase-type and a heavy-tailed distribution.

Commonly, after tuning the parameters of FOPID\ncontroller, its transfer function is discretized (for realization purposes)\nusing the so-called generating function. This discretization is the origin of\nsome errors and unexpected results in feedback systems. It may even happen that\nthe controller obtained by discretizing a FOPID controller works worse than a\ndirectly-tuned discrete-time classical PID controller. Moreover, FOPID\ncontrollers cannot directly be applied to the processes modeled by, e.g., the\nARMA or ARMAX model. The aim of this paper is to propose a discrete-time\nversion of the FOPID controller and discuss on its properties and applications.\nSimilar to the FOPID controller, the proposed structure applies nonlocal\noperators (with adjustable memory length) to the error signal. Two methods for\ntuning the parameters of the proposed controller are developed and it is shown\nthat the proposed controller has the capacity of solving complicated control\nproblems with a high performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 12:26:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-02"}

For $p_T \\gtrsim 1$ GeV the\nanisotropic flow is found to be considerably enhanced, if the dijets deposit on\naverage more than 12 GeV in the medium (or equivalently 6 GeV for each jet of\nthe pair), which corresponds, in our model, to an average suppression greater\nthan $65\\%$ of the initial jet transverse energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 15:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

The evolution of the\ndune can be separated into two phases: a rapid initial adjustment to a state of\nquasi-steady avalanching perpendicular to the blade, followed by a much slower\nphase of lateral spreading and radial migration. The quasi-steady avalanching\nsets up a well-defined perpendicular profile with a nearly constant slope. This\nprofile can be scaled by the depth against the bulldozer to collapse data from\ndifferent times, radial positions and experiments onto common master curves\nthat are characteristic of the granular material and depend on the local Froude\nnumber. The lateral profile of the dune along the face of the bulldozer varies\nmore gradually with radial position, and evolves by slow lateral spreading. The\nspreading is asymmetrical, with the inward progress of the dune eventually\narrested and its bulk migrating to larger radii. A one-dimensional\ndepth-averaged model recovers the nearly linear perpendicular profile of the\ndune, but does not capture the finer nonlinear details of the master curves.

Ideally, a BC\nprotocol should be simple, reliable, easy to implement using existing\ntechnologies, and most importantly unconditionally secure in the sense that its\nsecurity is based on an information-theoretic proof rather than computational\ncomplexity assumption or the existence of a trustworthy arbitrator. Here we\nreport such a provably secure scheme involving only one-way classical\ncommunications whose unconditional security is based on no superluminal\nsignaling (NSS). Our scheme is inspired by the earlier works by Kent, who\nproposed two impractical relativistic protocols whose unconditional securities\nare yet to be established as well as several provably unconditionally secure\nprotocols which rely on both quantum mechanics and NSS. Our scheme is\nconceptually simple and shows for the first time that quantum communication is\nnot needed to achieve unconditional security for BC. Moreover, with purely\nclassical communications, our scheme is practical and easy to implement with\nexisting telecom technologies. This completes the cycle of study of\nunconditionally secure bit commitment based on known physical laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 15:50:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 02:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The test, which is independent of the\ndetails of the assumed cosmology,is based on comparisons of the surface\nbrightness (SB) of identical objects at different cosmological distances.\nClaims have been made that the Tolman test provides compelling evidence against\na static model for the Universe. In this paper we reconsider this subject by\nadopting a static Euclidean Universe with a linear Hubble relation at all z\n(which is not the standard Einstein- de Sitter model),resulting in a relation\nbetween flux and luminosity that is virtually indistinguishable from the one\nused for LCDM models. Based on the analysis of the UV surface brightness of\nluminous disk galaxies from HUDF and GALEX datasets, reaching from the local\nUniverse to z ~ 5 we show that the surface brightness remains constant as\nexpected in a SEU.\n  A re-analysis of previously-published data used for the Tolman test at lower\nredshift, when treated within the same framework, confirms the results of the\npresent analysis by extending our claim to elliptical galaxies. We conclude\nthat available observations of galactic SB are consistent with a static\nEuclidean model of the Universe.\n  We do not claim that the consistency of the adopted model with SB data is\nsufficient by itself to confirm what would be a radical transformation in our\nunderstanding of the cosmos. However, we believe this result is more than\nsufficient reason to examine further this combination of hypotheses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 04:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-06"}
