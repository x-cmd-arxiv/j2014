The model accurately predicts the resulting mode-dependent $Q$s of a\nlow-stress silicon-rich and a high-stress stoichiometric SiN membrane. The\nlarge acoustic mismatch of the low-stress membrane to the substrate seems to\nminimize radiation loss and $Q$s of higher modes ($n \\wedge m \\geq 3$) are\nlimited by intrinsic losses. The study of these intrinsic losses in low-stress\nmembranes with varying lengths $L$ and thicknesses $h$ reveals an inverse\nlinear dependence of the intrinsic loss with $h$ for thin resonators\nindependent of $L$. This finding was confirmed by comparing the intrinsic\ndissipation of arbitrary (membranes, strings, and cantilevers) SiN resonators\nextracted from literature, suggesting surface loss as ubiquitous damping\nmechanism in thin SiN resonators with $Q_{surf} = \\beta \\cdot h$ and $\\beta =\n6\\times10^{10} \\pm4\\times 10^{10}$~m$^{-1}$.

The abstract notion of a \"pattern\"\nis introduced, which may be seen as an analogue of the space group of\nisometries preserving a tiling but where, instead, one considers partial\nisometries preserving portions of it. These inverse semigroups of partial\ntransformations are the suitable analogue of the space group for patterns with\nFLC but few global symmetries. In a similar vein we introduce the notion of a\n\\emph{collage}, a system of equivalence relations on the ambient space of a\npattern, which we show is capable of generalising many constructions applicable\nto the study of FLC tilings and Delone sets, such as the expression of the\ntiling space as an inverse limit of approximants.\n  An invariant is constructed for our abstract patterns, the so called\npattern-equivariant (PE) homology. These homology groups are defined using\ninfinite singular chains on the ambient space of the pattern, although we show\nthat one may define cellular versions which are isomorphic under suitable\nconditions. For FLC tilings these cellular PE chains are analogous to the PE\ncellular cochains \\cite{Sadun1}. The PE homology and cohomology groups are\nshown to be related through Poincar\\'{e} duality.\n  An efficient and highly geometric method for the computation of the PE\nhomology groups for hierarchical tilings is presented. The rotationally\ninvariant PE homology groups are shown not to be a topological invariant for\nthe associated tiling space and seem to retain extra information about global\nsymmetries of tilings in the tiling space. We show how the PE homology groups\nmay be incorporated into a spectral sequence converging to the \\v{C}ech\ncohomology of the rigid hull of a tiling.

In\nparticular, our convex banding estimator is minimax rate adaptive in Frobenius\nand operator norms, up to log factors, over commonly-studied classes of\ncovariance matrices, and over more general classes. Furthermore, it correctly\nrecovers the bandwidth when the true covariance is exactly banded. Our convex\nformulation admits a simple and efficient algorithm. Empirical studies\ndemonstrate its practical effectiveness and illustrate that our exactly-banded\nestimator works well even when the true covariance matrix is only close to a\nbanded matrix, confirming our theoretical results. Our method compares\nfavorably with all existing methods, in terms of accuracy and speed. We\nillustrate the practical merits of the convex banding estimator by showing that\nit can be used to improve the performance of discriminant analysis for\nclassifying sound recordings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 20:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}

It is ubiquitous in many networks but poses many modelling\nchallenges. Clustering typically manifests itself by a higher than expected\nfrequency of triangles, and this has led to the principle of constructing\nnetworks from such building blocks. This approach has been generalised to\nnetworks being constructed from a set of more exotic subgraphs. As long as\nthese are fully connected, it is then possible to derive mean-field models that\napproximate epidemic dynamics well. However, there are virtually no results for\nnon-fully connected subgraphs. In this paper, we provide a general and\nautomated approach to deriving a set of ordinary differential equations, or\nmean-field model, that describes, to a high degree of accuracy, the expected\nvalues of system-level quantities, such as the prevalence of infection. Our\napproach offers a previously unattainable degree of control over the\narrangement of subgraphs and network characteristics such as classical node\ndegree, variance and clustering. The combination of these features makes it\npossible to generate families of networks with different subgraph compositions\nwhile keeping classical network metrics constant. Using our approach, we show\nthat higher-order structure realised either through the introduction of loops\nof different sizes or by generating clustered networks based on different\nsubgraphs, leads to significant differences in epidemic dynamics despite\ncontrolling for basic network metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 21:07:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 12:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-07"}

The clock time\nof each polarimeter event is used to unfold the 120-kHz spin precession and\nassign events to bins according to the direction of the horizontal\npolarization. After accumulation for one or more seconds, the down-up\nscattering asymmetry can be calculated for each direction and matched to a\nsinusoidal function whose magnitude is proportional to the horizontal\npolarization. This requires prior knowledge of the spin tune or polarization\nprecession rate. An initial estimate is refined by re-sorting the events as the\nspin tune is adjusted across a narrow range and searching for the maximum\npolarization magnitude. The result is biased toward polarization values that\nare too large, in part because of statistical fluctuations but also because\nsinusoidal fits to even random data will produce sizeable magnitudes when the\nphase is left free to vary. An analysis procedure is described that matches the\ntime dependence of the horizontal polarization to templates based on\nemittance-driven polarization loss while correcting for the positive bias. This\ninformation will be used to study ways to extend the horizontal polarization\nlifetime by correcting spin tune spread using ring sextupole fields and thereby\nto support the feasibility of searching for an intrinsic electric dipole moment\nusing polarized beams in a storage ring.

In the prior works,\ndetecting these ECVs use a set of sinks pertaining to the ECVs under detection.\nIn this paper, we argue that a more comprehensive and effective approach should\nstart by a systematic selection and classification of vulnerability-specific\nsinks (VSinks). The set of VSinks is much larger than those used in the\nprevious works. Based on these VSinks, our sink-driven approach can detect\ndifferent kinds of ECVs in an app in two steps. First, VSinks and their\ncategories are identified through a typical forward reachability analysis.\nSecond, based on each VSink's category, a corresponding detection method is\nused to identify the ECV via a customized backward dataflow analysis. We also\ndesign a semi-auto guided analysis and validation capability for system-only\nbroadcast checking to remove some false positives. We implement our sink-driven\napproach in a tool called ECVDetector and evaluate it with the top 1K Android\napps. Using ECVDetector we successfully identify a total of 49 vulnerable apps\nacross all four ECV categories we have defined.

However, the majority of first-principles modelling has been\nperformed at fixed temperatures, and there has been no comprehensive and\nsystematic computational study of the effect of temperature on the material\nproperties. We report a comparative lattice-dynamics study of the temperature\ndependence of the properties of PbS, PbSe and PbTe, focussing particularly on\nthose relevant to thermoelectric performance, viz. phonon frequencies, lattice\nthermal conductivity, and electronic band structure. Calculations are performed\nwithin the quasi-harmonic approximation, with the inclusion of phonon-phonon\ninteractions from many-body perturbation theory, which are used to compute\nphonon lifetimes and predict the lattice thermal conductivity. The results are\ncritically compared against experimental data and other calculations, and add\nnew insight to on-going research on the PbX compounds in relation to the\noff-centring of Pb at high temperatures, which is shown to be related to phonon\nsoftening. The agreement with experiment suggests that this method could serve\nas a straightforward, powerful and generally-applicable means of investigating\nthe temperature dependence of material properties from first principles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 May 2014 10:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}

At each time, the server can observe instantaneous service rates for\nonly a subset of flows (from within a fixed collection of observable subsets)\nbefore scheduling a flow in the subset for service. We are interested in\nqueue-length aware scheduling to keep the queues short, and develop scheduling\nalgorithms that use only partial service rate information from subsets of\nchannels to minimize the likelihood of queue overflow in the system.\nSpecifically, we present a new joint subset-sampling and scheduling algorithm\ncalled Max-Exp that uses only the current queue lengths to pick a subset of\nflows, and subsequently schedules a flow using the Exponential rule. When the\ncollection of observable subsets is disjoint, we show that Max-Exp achieves the\nbest exponential decay rate, among all scheduling algorithms using partial\ninformation, of the tail of the longest queue in the system. Towards this, we\nemploy novel analytical techniques for studying the performance of scheduling\nalgorithms using partial state, which may be of independent interest. These\ninclude new sample-path large deviations results for processes obtained by\nnon-random, predictable sampling of sequences of independent and identically\ndistributed random variables. A consequence of these results is that scheduling\nwith partial state information yields a rate function significantly different\nfrom scheduling with full channel information. In the special case when the\nobservable subsets are singleton flows, i.e., when there is effectively no a\npriori channel-state information, Max-Exp reduces to simply serving the flow\nwith the longest queue; thus, our results show that to always serve the longest\nqueue in the absence of any channel-state information is large-deviations\noptimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 May 2014 14:52:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 07:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

The whole configuration space of\npartially NH3/NH2/H covered GaN(0001) surface was divided into zones\ndifferently pinned Fermi level: at Ga broken bond state for dominantly bare\nsurface (region I), at VBM for NH2 and H covered (region II), and at CBM for\nNH3 covered surface (region III). The extensive ab intio calculations show\nvalidity of electron counting rule (ECR) for all mixed coverage, for bordering\nthese three regions. The adsorption was analyzed using newly identified\ndependence of the adsorption energy on the charge transfer at the surface. For\nregion I and II ammonia adsorb dissociatively, disintegrating into H adatom and\nHN2 radical for large fraction of vacant sites while for high coverage the\nammonia adsorption is molecular. The dissociative adsorption energy strongly\ndepends on the Fermi level at the surface (pinned) and in the bulk (unpinned)\nwhile the molecular adsorption energy is determined by bonding to surface only,\nin accordance to the recently published theory. The molecular adsorption is\ndetermined by the energy of covalent bonding to the surface. Ammonia adsorption\nin region III (Fermi level pinned at CBM) leads to unstable configuration both\nmolecular and dissociative which is explained by the fact that Ga-broken bond\nsites are doubly occupied by electrons. The adsorbing ammonia brings 8\nelectrons to the surface, necessitating transfer of the electrons from\nGa-broken bond state to Fermi level, energetically costly process. Adsorption\nof ammonia at H-covered site leads to creation of NH2 radical at the surface\nand escape of H2 molecule. The process energy is close to 0.12 eV, thus not\nlarge, but the inverse process is not possible due to escape of the hydrogen\nmolecule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 May 2014 15:20:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}
