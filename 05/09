The $v_2$\ncoefficient was measured with three different methods and in three centrality\nclasses in the interval 0-50%. A positive $v_2$ is observed in mid-central\ncollisions (30-50% centrality class), with an mean value of\n$0.204_{-0.036}^{+0.099}$ (tot.unc.) in the interval $2 < p_{\\rm T} < 6$\nGeV/$c$, which decreases towards more central collisions (10-30% and 0-10%\nclasses).

Effects on the best bid price arising from the arrival of limit buy\norders at more favourable prices, the incoming market sell orders potentially\nwalking the book, and deriving from the cancellations of limit sell orders at\nthe best ask price are incorporated in the proposed price dynamics.

The unique pseudospin structure of Dirac\nelectrons leads to emerging phenomena such as the massless Dirac cone2,\nanomalous quantum Hall effect2, 3, and Klein tunneling4, 5 in graphene. The\ncapability to manipulate electron pseudospin is highly desirable for novel\ngraphene electronics, and it requires precise control to differentiate the two\ngraphene sub-lattices at atomic level. Graphene/boron nitride (graphene/BN)\nMoire superlattice, where a fast sub-lattice oscillation due to B-N atoms is\nsuperimposed on the slow Moire period, provides an attractive approach to\nengineer the electron pseudospin in graphene13-18. This unusual Moire\nsuperlattice leads to a spinor potential with unusual hybridization of electron\npseudospins, which can be probed directly through infrared spectroscopy because\noptical transitions are very sensitive to excited state wavefunctions. Here, we\nperform micro-infrared spectroscopy on graphene/BN heterostructure and\ndemonstrate that the Moire superlattice potential is dominated by a\npseudospin-mixing component analogous to a spatially varying pseudomagnetic\nfield. In addition, we show that the spinor potential depends sensitively on\nthe gate-induced carrier concentration in graphene, indicating a strong\nrenormalization of the spinor potential from electron-electron interactions.\nOur study offers deeper understanding of graphene pseudospin structure under\nspinor Moire potential, as well as exciting opportunities to control pseudospin\nin two-dimensional heterostructures for novel electronic and photonic\nnanodevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2014 17:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-27"}

We used our MUESLI code to calculate GC\nsurvival rates for typical early-type galaxy potentials covering a wide range\nof observed galaxy properties. We do this for isotropic and radially\nanisotropic GC velocity distributions. We find that the calculated GC survival\nfraction, f_s, depends linearly on the logarithm of the 3D mass density,\nrho_3D, within the galaxy's half light radius, with f_s proportional to\n(rho_3D)^(-0.17). For a given galaxy, survival rates are lower for radially\nanisotropic configurations than for the isotropic GC cases. We apply these\nrelations to a literature sample of 219 early-type galaxies from Harris et al.\n(2013) in the range M_V=[-24.5:-15.5] mag. The expected GC survival fraction\nranges from ~50% for the most massive galaxies with the largest radii to ~10%\nfor the most compact galaxies. We find that intermediate luminosity galaxies\nM_V=[-20.5:-17.5] mag have the strongest expected GC erosion.

As a consequence, the u-shape of S_N vs. M_V gets erased\nalmost entirely when correcting the S_N values for the effect of GC erosion.

Quasicontacts, pairs of spheres on the verge\nof coming in contact, are irrelevant for static stability, but they come into\nplay when considering dynamic stability, as does the distribution of contact\nforces. We show that the effects of marginal dynamic stability, as manifested\nin the distributions of quasicontacts and weak contacts, are consequential and\nnontrivial.

To investigate this effect, we perform the\nfirst fully-consistent linear analysis of the Ernst spacetime, an exact\nsolution of the Einstein--Maxwell equations describing a black hole immersed in\na uniform magnetic field $B$. In the limit in which the black-hole mass\nvanishes, the background reduces to the marginally stable Melvin spacetime. The\npresence of an event horizon introduces a small dissipative term, resulting in\na set of long-lived -- or unstable -- modes. We provide a simple interpretation\nof the mode spectrum in terms of a small perfect absorber immersed in a\nconfining box of size $\\sim1/B$ and show that rotation triggers a superradiant\ninstability. By studying scalar perturbations of a magnetized Kerr--Newman\nblack hole, we are able to confirm and quantify the details of this\ninstability. The instability time scale can be orders of magnitude shorter than\nthat associated to massive bosonic fields. The instability extracts angular\nmomentum from the event horizon, competing against accretion. This implies that\nstrong magnetic fields set an upper bound on the black-hole spin. Conversely,\nobservations of highly-spinning massive black holes impose an intrinsic limit\nto the strength of the surrounding magnetic field.

The local U(1)_H gauge\nsymmetry is assigned to the extra Higgs doublet in order to avoid the\nHiggs-mediated flavor problems, and it spontaneously breaks down to its\ndiscrete subgroup. The lightest neutral scalar component H of the\nU(1)_H-charged Higgs doublet, which does not have Yukawa couplings with the\nStandard-Model (SM) fermions, is stable because of the remnant discrete\nsymmetry, and it interacts with the SM particles through the U(1)_H gauge boson\n(Z_H) exchange as well as the SM boson exchange.

However, a fundamental question arises: given a size limitation on\nthe observation region, what is the upper bound on the degrees of freedom of\nsignals observed within a broadband multipath field over a finite time window?\nIn order to address this question, we characterize the multipath field as a sum\nof a finite number of orthogonal waveforms or spatial modes. We show that (i)\nthe \"effective observation time\" is independent of spatial modes and different\nfrom actual observation time, (ii) in wideband transmission regimes, the\n\"effective bandwidth\" is spatial mode dependent and varies from the given\nfrequency bandwidth.

Instead,\nanalogous to Shannon's communication model where signals are encoded in only\none spatial mode, the available signal degrees of freedom in spatially diverse\nwideband multipath fields is the time-bandwidth product result extended from\none spatial mode to finite modes.

One approach that is used\nto solve this problem is to try instead to associate a tree (or even a network)\nto the multiset $\\Sigma_{\\Pi}$ consisting of all those bipartitions $\\{A,X-A\\}$\nwith $A$ a part of some partition in $\\Pi$. The rational behind this approach\nis that a phylogenetic tree with leaf set $X$ can be uniquely represented by\nthe set of bipartitions of $X$ induced by its edges. Motivated by these\nconsiderations, given a multiset $\\Sigma$ of bipartitions corresponding to a\nphylogenetic tree on $X$, in this paper we introduce and study the set\n$P(\\Sigma)$ consisting of those multisets of partitions $\\Pi$ of $X$ with\n$\\Sigma_{\\Pi}=\\Sigma$.

The wind of this star collides with the wind of its\nO8 II companion, leading to relatively strong X-ray emission. Measuring the\norbital variations of the line-of-sight absorption toward the X-ray emission\nfrom the wind-wind interaction zone yields information on the wind densities of\nboth stars. X-ray spectra have been collected at three key orbital phases to\nprobe the winds of both stars. Optical photometry has been gathered to set\nconstraints on the orbital inclination of the system. The X-ray spectra reveal\nprominent variations of the intervening column density toward the X-ray\nemission zone, which are in line with the expectations for a wind-wind\ncollision. We use a toy model to set constraints on the stellar wind parameters\nby attempting to reproduce the observed variations of the relative fluxes and\nwind optical depths at 1 keV. The lack of strong optical eclipses sets an upper\nlimit of about 68 degrees on the orbital inclination. The analysis of the\nvariations of the X-ray spectra suggests an inclination in the range 54 - 61\ndegrees and indicates that the secondary wind momentum ratio exceeds that of\nthe primary by at least a factor 5. Our models further suggest that the bulk of\nthe X-ray emission arises from the innermost region of the wind interaction\nzone, which is from a region whose outer radius, as measured from the secondary\nstar, lies between 0.5 and 1.5 times the orbital separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 14:37:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 06:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Our approach extends the capabilities of\nexisting agent-based models for individual movement developed to predict the\nspread of directly transmitted pathogens in populations. To extend to\nmosquito-borne disease, agent-based models are coupled with differential\nequations representing `clouds' of mosquitoes in geographic patches that\naccount for mosquito ecology, including heterogeneity in mosquito density,\nemergence rates, and extrinsic incubation period. We illustrate the method by\nadapting an agent-based model for human movement across a network to\nmosquito-borne disease. We investigated the importance of heterogeneity in\nmosquito population dynamics and host movement on pathogen transmission,\nmotivating the utility of detailed models of individual behavior. We observed\nthat the total number of infected people is greater in heterogeneous patch\nmodels with one high risk patch and high or medium human movement than it would\nbe in a random mixing homogeneous model. Our hybrid agent-based/differential\nequation model is able to quantify the importance of the heterogeneity in\npredicting the spread and invasion of mosquito-borne pathogens.

It is based on\nthe assembled low-rank canonical tensor representations of the collected\npotentials using pointwise sums of shifted canonical vectors representing the\nsingle generating function, say the Newton kernel. For a sum of electrostatic\npotentials over $L\\times L \\times L$ lattice embedded in a box the required\nstorage scales linearly in the 1D grid-size, $O(N )$, while the numerical cost\nis estimated by $O(N L)$. For periodic boundary conditions, the storage demand\nremains proportional to the 1D grid-size of a unit cell, $n=N/L$, while the\nnumerical cost reduces to $O(N)$, that outperforms the FFT-based Ewald-type\nsummation algorithms of complexity $O(N^3 \\log N)$. The complexity in the grid\nparameter $N$ can be reduced even to the logarithmic scale $O(\\log N)$ by using\ndata-sparse representation of canonical $N$-vectors via the quantics tensor\napproximation. For justification, we prove an upper bound on the quantics ranks\nfor the canonical vectors in the overall lattice sum.

Using cognitive mapping concepts for DEM registration, has evolved\nfrom this basic idea of using the mapping between the space to objects and\ndefining their relationships to form the basic landmarks that need to be\nmarked, stored and manipulated in and about the environment or other candidate\nenvironments, namely, in our case, the DEMs. The progressive two-level\nencapsulation of methods of geo-spatial cognition includes landmark knowledge\nand layout knowledge and can be useful for DEM registration. Space-based\napproach, that emphasizes on explicit extent of the environment under\nconsideration, and object-based approach, that emphasizes on the relationships\nbetween objects in the local environment being the two paradigms of cognitive\nmapping can be methodically integrated in this three-architecture for DEM\nregistration. Initially, P-model based segmentation is performed followed by\nlandmark formation for contextual mapping that uses contextual pyramid\nformation. Apart from landmarks being used for registration key-point finding,\nEuclidean distance based deformation calculation has been used for\ntransformation and change detection. Landmarks have been categorized to belong\nto either being flat-plain areas without much variation in the land heights;\npeaks that can be found when there is gradual increase in height as compared to\nthe flat areas; valleys, marked with gradual decrease in the height seen in\nDEM; and finally, ripple areas with very shallow crests and nadirs. Fractal\nbased compression was used for storage of co-registered DEMs. This method may\nfurther be extended for DEM-topographic map and DEM-to-remote sensed image\nregistration. Experimental results further cement the fact that DEM\nregistration may be effectively done using the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 05:59:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}

For this purpose we have assumed an uniform distribution for\nthe angular momentum density of the rotating perfect fluid. The contours of\nequipotential surfaces are illustrated in order to obtain the nature of inflow\nand outflow of matters. It has been noticed that, the marginally stable\ncircular orbits originating from decreasing angular momentum density lead to\nclosed equipotential surfaces along with cusp allowing existence of accretion\ndisks. On the other hand, the growing part of angular momentum density exhibits\ncentral rings for which stable configurations are possible. However inflow of\nmatter is prohibited. Among the solutions discussed in this work, the charged\n$F(R)$ gravity and Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet solution exhibit inflow and\noutflow of matter with central rings present. These varied accretion disk\nstructure of perfect fluid attribute these spacetimes astrophysical importance.\nThe effect of higher curvature terms predominantly arises from region near the\nblack hole horizon. Hence the structural difference of accretion disk in\nmodified gravity theories with comparison to general relativity may act as an\nexperimental probe for these alternative gravity theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 11:28:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 11:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-11"}

It was based solely on classical mechanics\nwithout employing any concepts , associated with the time dilatation or/and\nlength contraction. It yielded the 1-D Lorentz transformation (LT), free of\ninconsistencies (inherent in the canonical derivation and interpretations of\nthe LT). Here we apply the same approach to derive the LT for the 3-dimensional\nmotion of a particle and the attendant law of velocity composition. As a\nresult, the infinite set of four-parameter transformations is obtained. The\nrequirement of linearity of these transformations selects out of this set the\ntwo-parameter subset . The values of the remaining two parameters ,dictated by\nphysics of the motion, is explicitly determined , yielding the canonical form\nof the 3-dimensional LT. The generalized law of velocity composition and the\nattendant invariant ( not postulated apriori) of the motion are derived, As in\nthe one-dimensional case, present derivation, as a whole, does not have any\nneed in introducing the concepts of the time dilatation and length contraction,\nand is based on the classical concepts of time and space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 05:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-25"}
