The increase in volatility spillovers correlates with\nthe progressive financialization of the commodities. In terms of asymmetries in\nspillovers we show that periods of increasing crude oil prices strongly\ncorrelate with dominating spillovers due to bad volatility.

After the 2008\nfinancial crisis the asymmetries in spillovers markedly declined in terms of\ntotal as well as directional spillovers.

In these markets, there is a requester who wants to\nhire workers to accomplish some tasks. Each worker is assumed to give some\nutility to the requester. Moreover each worker has a minimum cost that he wants\nto get paid for getting hired. This minimum cost is assumed to be private\ninformation of the workers. The question then is - if the requester has a\nlimited budget, how to design a direct revelation mechanism that picks the\nright set of workers to hire in order to maximize the requester's utility.\n  We note that although the previous work has studied this problem, a crucial\ndifference in which we deviate from earlier work is the notion of large-scale\nmarkets that we introduce in our model. Without the large market assumption, it\nis known that no mechanism can achieve an approximation factor better than\n0.414 and 0.5 for deterministic and randomized mechanisms respectively (while\nthe best known deterministic and randomized mechanisms achieve an approximation\nratio of 0.292 and 0.33 respectively). In this paper, we design a\nbudget-feasible mechanism for large markets that achieves an approximation\nfactor of 1-1/e (i.e. almost 0.63). Our mechanism can be seen as a\ngeneralization of an alternate way to look at the proportional share mechanism\nwhich is used in all the previous works so far on this problem. Interestingly,\nwe also show that our mechanism is optimal by showing that no truthful\nmechanism can achieve a factor better than 1-1/e; thus, fully resolving this\nsetting.

The difference\nbetween these two helicities reflects some topological features of the domain\nas well as the velocity and vorticity fields which is discussed and is shown\nfor simply connected domains the two helicities coincide.

In mechanism design, auctions are usually designed\nto incentivize advertisers to bid their truthful valuations and to assure both\nthe advertisers and the auctioneer a non-negative utility. Nonetheless, in\nsponsored search auctions, the click-through-rates (CTRs) of the advertisers\nare often unknown to the auctioneer and thus standard truthful mechanisms\ncannot be directly applied and must be paired with an effective learning\nalgorithm for the estimation of the CTRs. This introduces the critical problem\nof designing a learning mechanism able to estimate the CTRs at the same time as\nimplementing a truthful mechanism with a revenue loss as small as possible\ncompared to an optimal mechanism designed with the true CTRs. Previous work\nshowed that, when dominant-strategy truthfulness is adopted, in single-slot\nauctions the problem can be solved using suitable exploration-exploitation\nmechanisms able to achieve a per-step regret (over the auctioneer's revenue) of\norder $O(T^{-1/3})$ (where T is the number of times the auction is repeated).\nIt is also known that, when truthfulness in expectation is adopted, a per-step\nregret (over the social welfare) of order $O(T^{-1/2})$ can be obtained. In\nthis paper we extend the results known in the literature to the case of\nmulti-slot auctions. In this case, a model of the user is needed to\ncharacterize how the advertisers' valuations change over the slots. We adopt\nthe cascade model that is the most famous model in the literature for sponsored\nsearch auctions. We prove a number of novel upper bounds and lower bounds both\non the auctioneer's revenue loss and social welfare w.r.t. to the VCG auction\nand we report numerical simulations investigating the accuracy of the bounds in\npredicting the dependency of the regret on the auction parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 May 2014 01:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-13"}

One explanation for this decrease in angle relies on the\nassumption that a ship cannot generate wavelengths much greater than its hull\nlength. An alternative interpretation is that the wave pattern that is observed\nin practice is defined by the location of the highest peaks; for wakes created\nby sufficiently fast-moving objects, these highest peaks no longer lie on the\noutermost divergent waves, resulting in a smaller apparent angle. In this\npaper, we focus on the problems of free surface flow past a single submerged\npoint source and past a submerged source doublet. In the linear version of\nthese problems, we measure the apparent wake angle formed by the highest peaks,\nand observe the following three regimes: a small Froude number pattern, in\nwhich the divergent waves are not visible; standard wave patterns for which the\nmaximum peaks occur on the outermost divergent waves; and a third regime in\nwhich the highest peaks form a V-shape with an angle much less than the Kelvin\nangle. For nonlinear flows, we demonstrate that nonlinearity has the effect of\nincreasing the apparent wake angle so that some highly nonlinear solutions have\napparent wake angles that are greater than Kelvin's angle. For large Froude\nnumbers, the effect on apparent wake angle can be more dramatic, with the\npossibility of strong nonlinearity shifting the wave pattern from the third\nregime to the second. We expect our nonlinear results will translate to other\nmore complicated flow configurations, such as flow due to a steadily moving\nclosed body such as a submarine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 May 2014 06:37:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 06:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-11"}

In response to\nthis, many energy-aware algorithms have been developed in different layers of\nHPC systems, including the hardware layer, service layer and system layer.\nThese algorithms are of two types: first, algorithms which directly try to\nimprove the energy by tweaking frequency operation or scheduling algorithms;\nand second, algorithms which focus on improving the performance of the system,\nwith the assumption that efficient running of a system may indirectly save more\nenergy.\n  In this thesis, we develop algorithms in both layers. First, we introduce\nthree algorithms to directly improve the energy of scheduled tasks at the\nhardware level by using Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS). Second, we\npropose two algorithms for modelling and resource provisioning of MapReduce\napplications (a well-known parametric distributed framework currently used by\nGoogle, Yahoo, Facebook and LinkedIn) based on its configuration parameters.\nCertainly, estimating the performance (e.g., execution time or CPU clock ticks)\nof a MapReduce application can be later used for smart scheduling of such\napplications in clouds or clusters.\n  To evaluate the algorithms, we have conducted extensive simulation and real\nexperiments on a 5-node physical cluster with up to 25 virtual nodes, using\nboth synthetic and real world applications. Also, the proposed new algorithms\nare compared with existing algorithms by experimentation, and the experimental\nresults reveal new information on the performance of these algorithms, as well\nas on the properties of MapReduce and DVFS.

However, this action is not well studied. In this paper we\nprovide some tools to work with this action and prove the following results.\n  1) The wave-front set of any z-finite distribution on G over any point $g\\in\nG$ lies inside the nilpotent cone of $T_g^*G \\cong \\mathfrak{g}$.\n  2) Let $H_1,H_2 \\subset G$ be symmetric subgroups. Consider the space J of\n$H_1\\times H_2$-invariant distributions on G. We prove that the z-finite\ndistributions in J form a dense subspace. In fact we prove this result in wider\ngenerality, where the groups $H_i$ are spherical groups of certain type and the\ninvariance condition is replaced by equivariance. Further we apply those\nresults to density and regularity of spherical characters.\n  The first result can be viewed as a version of Howe's expansion of\ncharacters. The second result can be viewed as a spherical space analog of a\nclassical theorem on density of characters of admissible representations. It\ncan also be viewed as a spectral version of Bernstein's localization principle.\n  In the Archimedean case, the first result is well-known and the second\nremains open.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 May 2014 15:41:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2015 07:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-06"}

The cases of near-extremal, extremal and nonextremal black holes are\nanalyzed. For nonrotating black holes, in the strong magnetic field ISCO\napproaches the horizon (when backreaction of the field on geometry is\nneglected). Rotation destroys this phenomenon. The angular momentum and radius\nof ISCO look model-independent in the main approximation. We also study the\ncollisions between two particles that results in the ultra-high energy\n$E_{c.m.}$ in the centre of mass frame. Two scenarios are considered - when one\nparticle moves on the near-horizon ISCO or when collision occurs on the\nhorizon, one particle having the energy and angular momentum typical of ISCO.\nIf the magnetic field is strong enough and a black hole is slow rotating,\n$E_{c.m.}$ can become arbitrarily large. Kinematics of high-energy collision is\ndiscussed. As an example, we consider the magnetized Schwarzschild black hole\nfor an arbitrary strength of the field (the Ernst solution).
