In this region,\ndelimited by a well-defined $T^*_{neq}(p)$ line, the photo-excitation process\ntriggers the evolution of antinodal excitations from gapped (localized) to\ndelocalized quasi-particles characterized by a longer lifetime. The novel\nconcept of photo-enhanced antinodal conductivity is naturally explained within\nthe single-band Hubbard model, in which the short-range Coulomb repulsion leads\nto a k-space differentiation between \"nodal\" quasiparticles and antinodal\nexcitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2014 16:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

The key point of this model is the\nnonminimal coupling to gravity in unitary gauge.

Motivated by this goal, we study in great\nanalytical and numerical detail the static and spherically symmetric solutions\nof the equations of motion in the presence of standard baryonic matter, called\n\"Higgs monopoles\" and presented in 1305.2640. These particlelike solutions may\narise naturally in tensor-scalar gravity with mexican hat potential and are the\nonly globally regular asymptotically flat solutions with finite classical\nenergy. In the case when the parameters of the potential are taken to be the\nones of the standard model, we find that the deviations from general relativity\nare extremely small, especially for bodies of astrophysical size and density.\nThis allows to derive a simplified description of the monopole, for which the\nmetric inside the spherical matter distribution can be approximated by the\nstandard metric of general relativity. We study how the properties of these\nmonopoles depend on the strength of the nonminimal coupling to gravity and on\nthe baryonic mass and compactness. An important and original result is the\nexistence of a mechanism of resonant amplification of the Higgs field inside\nthe monopole that comes into play for large nonminimal coupling.

To understand\ninfluences of nodes in a network, a classical metric is centrality within which\nthere are multiple specific instances including degree centrality, closeness\ncentrality, betweenness centrality and more. As of today, existing algorithms\nto identify nodes with high centrality measures operate upon the entire (or\nrather global) network, resulting in high computational complexity. In this\npaper, we design efficient algorithms for determining the betweenness\ncentrality in large scale networks by taking advantage of the modular topology\nexhibited by most of these large scale networks. Very briefly, modular\ntopologies are those wherein the entire network appears partitioned into\ndistinct modules (or clusters or communities), wherein nodes within the module\n(that likely share highly similar profiles) have dense connections between\nthem, while connections across modules are relatively sparse. Using a novel\nadaptation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and executing it over local\nmodules and over sparse edges between modules, we design algorithms that can\ncorrectly compute the betweenness centrality much faster than existing\nalgorithms. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that leverage\nmodular topologies of large scale networks to address the centrality problem,\nthough here we mostly limit our discussions to social networks. We also provide\nmore insights on centrality in general, and also how our algorithms can be used\nto determine other centrality measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2014 19:01:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 23:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-13"}

The observed E-mode polarization power spectrum,\ndisplaying six acoustic peaks in the range $200<\\ell<3000$, is an excellent fit\nto the prediction of the best-fit cosmological models from WMAP9+ACT and Planck\ndata. The polarization power spectrum, which mainly reflects primordial plasma\nvelocity perturbations, provides an independent determination of cosmological\nparameters consistent with those based on the temperature power spectrum, which\nresults mostly from primordial density perturbations.

Models of photon-dominated regions (PDRs) still fail to fully\nreproduce some of the observed properties, in particular the combination of the\nintensities of different PDR cooling lines together with the chemical\nstratification, as observed e.g. for the Orion Bar PDR. Aims. We aim to\nconstruct a numerical PDR model, KOSMA-\\tau 3D, to simulate full spectral cubes\nof line emission from arbitrary PDRs in three dimensions (3D). The model is to\nreproduce the intensity of the main cooling lines from the Orion Bar PDR and\nthe observed layered structure of the different transitions. Methods. We build\nup a 3D compound, made of voxels (\"3D pixels\") that contain a discrete mass\ndistribution of spherical \"clumpy\" structures, approximating the fractal ISM.\nTo analyse each individual clump the new code is combined with the KOSMA-\\tau\nPDR model. Probabilistic algorithms are used to calculate the local FUV flux\nfor each voxel as well as the voxel-averaged line emissivities and optical\ndepths, based on the properties of the individual clumps. Finally, the\ncomputation of the radiative transfer through the compound provides full\nspectral cubes.

The discovery of the unique source HESS J1507-622 in the very high\nenergy (VHE) range (100 GeV-100 TeV) opened new possibilities to study the\nparent population of ultra-relativistic particles found in astrophysical\nsources and underlined the possibility of new scenarios/mechanisms crucial for\nunderstanding the underlying astrophysical processes in nonthermal sources.\nAims. The follow-up X-ray (0.2 - 10 keV) observations on HESS J1507-622 are\nreported, and possibilities regarding the nature of the VHE source and that of\nthe newly discovered X-ray sources are investigated. Methods.We obtained\nbservations with the X-ray satellites XMM-Newton and Chandra. Background\ncorrections were applied to the data to search for extended diffuse emission.\nSince HESS J1507-622 covers a large part of the field of view of these\ninstruments, blank-sky background fields were used. Results. The discovery of\nseveral new X-ray sources and a new, faint, extended X-ray source with a flux\nof ~6e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 is reported. Interestingly, a new, variable point-like\nX-ray source with a flux of ~8e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 appeared in the 2011\nobservation, which was not detected in the previous X-ray observations.\nConclusions. The X-ray observations revealed a faint, extended X-ray source\nthat may be a possible counterpart for HESS J1507-622. This source could be an\nX-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) remnant of the larger gamma-ray PWN, which is\nstill bright in IC emission.

We first introduce the concept of information dominating set\n(IDS). A subset of nodes in a given network is an IDS if knowing the opinions\nof nodes in this subset is sufficient to infer the opinion of the entire\nnetwork. We focus on two fundamental algorithmic problems: (i) given a subset\nof the network, how to determine whether it is an IDS; (ii) how to construct a\nminimum IDS. Assuming binary opinions and the local majority rule for opinion\ncorrelation, we show that the first problem is co-NP-complete and the second\nproblem is NP-hard in general networks. We then focus on networks with special\nstructures, in particular, acyclic networks. We show that in acyclic networks,\nboth problems admit linear-complexity solutions by establishing a connection\nbetween the IDS problems and the vertex cover problem. Our technique for\nestablishing the hardness of the IDS problems is based on a novel graph\ntransformation that transforms the IDS problems in a general network to that in\nan odd-degree network. This graph transformation technique not only gives an\napproximation algorithm to the IDS problems, but also provides a useful tool\nfor general studies related to the local majority rule.

The mass\nfunctions and properties of multiple stellar systems are consistent with each\nother. However, we find protostellar mergers are more common with lower\nopacities. Combining the results from the three calculations with the highest\nopacities, we obtain a stellar population consisting of more than 500 stars and\nbrown dwarfs. Many of the statistical properties of this population are in good\nagreement with those observed in our Galaxy, implying that gravity,\nhydrodynamics, and radiative feedback may be the primary ingredients for\ndetermining the statistical properties of low-mass stars. However, we do find\nindications that the calculations may be slightly too dissipative.

A given\ncell produces a sharp event at a fixed phase during the sniff cycle in response\nto a given odor; different cells have different phases. The olfactory bulb\nresponse to an odor is thus a sequence of sharp events. Here, we show that\nsharp event onset is biased toward certain phases of the ongoing gamma\nfrequency oscillation. Thus, the signature of an odor is a discrete sequence.\nThe fact that this sequence is relatively short suggests a new class of \"brute\nforce\" solutions to the problem of odor recognition: cortex may contain a small\nnumber of modules, each forming a persistent snapshot of what occurs in a\ncertain gamma cycle.

The\nresults show that the component of the Solar motion in the direction of\nGalactic rotation (denoted $S_2$) has a linear increase with respect to age,\nwhich may be a consequence of the scattering processes, and its value for a\ndynamical cold disk was found to be $8.0\\pm1.2~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$. $S_2$ also\nincreases linearly with respect to metallicity, which indicates that radial\nmigration is correlated to the metallicity gradient.

Data offloading through\nthird-party WiFi or femtocell access points (APs) can effectively alleviate the\ncellular network congestion in a low operational and capital expenditure. This\nsolution requires the cooperation and agreement of mobile cellular network\noperators (MNOs) and AP owners (APOs). In this paper, we model and analyze the\ninteraction among one MNO and multiple APOs (for the amount of MNO's offloading\ndata and the respective APOs' compensations) by using the Nash bargaining\ntheory. Specifically, we introduce a one-to-many bargaining game among the MNO\nand APOs, and analyze the bargaining solution (game equilibrium) systematically\nunder two different bargaining protocols: (i) sequential bargaining, where the\nMNO bargains with APOs sequentially, with one APO at a time, in a given order,\nand (ii) concurrent bargaining, where the MNO bargains with all APOs\nconcurrently. We quantify the benefits for APOs when bargaining sequentially\nand earlier with the MNO, and the losses for APOs when bargaining concurrently\nwith the MNO. We further study the group bargaining scenario where multiple\nAPOs form a group bargaining with the MNO jointly, and quantify the benefits\nfor APOs when forming such a group. Interesting, our analysis indicates that\ngrouping of APOs not only benefits the APOs in the group, but may also benefit\nsome APOs not in the group. Our results shed light on the economic aspects and\nthe possible outcomes of the MNO/APOs interactions, and can be used as a\nroadmap for designing policies for this promising data offloading solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 07:22:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 17:47:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 May 2014 04:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Via accurate\nregistration of infrared (IR) Very Large Telescope adaptive optics images with\noptical \\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} images we unambiguously identify the\nprecise location of the nucleus of a sample of nearby, type 2 AGN. Dust\nextinction maps of the central few kpc of these galaxies are constructed from\noptical-IR colour images, which allow tracing the dust morphology at scales of\nfew pc. In almost all cases, the IR nucleus is shifted by several tens of pc\nfrom the optical peak and its location is behind a dust filament, prompting to\nthis being a major, if not the only, cause of the nucleus obscuration. These\nnuclear dust lanes have extinctions $A_V \\geq 3-6$ mag, sufficient to at least\nhide the low-luminosity AGN class, and in some cases are observed to connect\nwith kpc-scale dust structures, suggesting that these are the nuclear fueling\nchannels. A precise location of the ionised gas H$\\alpha$ and\n[\\textsc{Si\\,vii}] 2.48 $\\mu$m coronal emission lines relative to those of the\nIR nucleus and dust is determined. The H$\\alpha$ peak emission is often shifted\nfrom the nucleus location and its sometimes conical morphology appears not to\nbe caused by a nuclear --torus-- collimation but to be strictly defined by the\nmorphology of the nuclear dust lanes. Conversely, [\\textsc{Si\\,vii}] 2.48\n$\\mu$m emission, less subjected to dust extinction, reflects the truly, rather\nisotropic, distribution of the ionised gas. All together, the precise location\nof the dust, ionised gas and nucleus is found compelling enough to cast doubts\non the universality of the pc-scale torus and supports its vanishing in\nlow-luminosity AGN. Finally, we provide the most accurate position of the NGC\n1068 nucleus, located at the South vertex of cloud B.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 07:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Detailed analyses of 2,922 minimum epochs showed that the\norbital period has varied through a combination with an upward-opening parabola\nand two sinusoidal variations, with periods of $P_3$=649 d and $P_4$=2,154 d\nand semi-amplitudes of $K_3$=193 s and $K_4$=49 s, respectively. The secular\nperiod increase could be interpreted as a combination of the secondary to\nprimary mass transfer and angular momentum loss. The most reasonable\nexplanation for both sinusoids is a pair of light-travel-time effects due to\ntwo circumbinary objects with projected masses of $M_3$=0.47 M$_\\odot$ and\n$M_4$=0.047 M$_\\odot$. The third-body parameters are consistent with those\ncalculated using the W-D binary code. For the orbital inclinations higher than\n43$^\\circ$, the fourth component has a mass within the hydrogen-burning limit\nof $\\sim$0.07 M$_\\odot$, which implies that it is a brown dwarf. A satisfactory\nmodel for the Kepler light curves was obtained through applying a cool spot to\nthe secondary component. The results demonstrate that the close eclipsing pair\nis in a semi-detached, but near-contact, configuration; the primary fills\napproximately 93% of its limiting lobe and is larger than the lobe-filling\nsecondary. Multiple frequency analyses were applied to the light residuals\nafter subtracting the synthetic eclipsing curve from the Kepler data. This\nrevealed that the primary component of V404 Lyr is a $\\gamma$ Dor type\npulsating star, exhibiting seven pulsation frequencies in the range of\n1.85$-$2.11 d$^{-1}$ with amplitudes of 1.38$-$5.72 mmag and pulsation\nconstants of 0.24$-$0.27 d.

However, inline deduplication degrades restore\nperformance of the latest backup due to fragmentation, and complicates deletion\nof ex- pired backups due to the sharing of data chunks. While out-of-line\ndeduplication addresses the problems by forward-pointing existing duplicate\nchunks to those of the latest backup, it introduces additional I/Os of writing\nand removing duplicate chunks. We design and implement RevDedup, an efficient\nhybrid inline and out-of-line deduplication system for backup storage. It\napplies coarse-grained inline deduplication to remove duplicates of the latest\nbackup, and then fine-grained out-of-line reverse deduplication to remove\nduplicates from older backups. Our reverse deduplication design limits the I/O\noverhead and prepares for efficient deletion of expired backups. Through\nextensive testbed experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets, we show\nthat RevDedup can bring high performance to the backup, restore, and deletion\noperations, while maintaining high storage efficiency comparable to\nconventional inline deduplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 08:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-23"}

The mechanical properties appear to be relevant to the length of\nthe columns of molecules compared to the thread length, instead of the usual\ncorrelation length. When short, the column entanglement being taken into\naccount, the strand exhibits rather fluid properties that may even look like\nnematic at a macroscopic scale. Then, the Plateau-Rayleigh instability soon\nbreaks the thread. However, the hydrodynamic objects being the columns instead\nof the molecules, the viscosity is anomalously large. The observations show\nthat the strands of columnar phases are made of filaments, or fibrils, that\nindeed are bundles of columns of molecules. They both explain the grooves and\nrings observed on the antenna or bamboo-like strand profiles. On pulling a\nstrand, the elongation stress eventually exceeds the plasticity threshold, thus\nbreaking columns and filaments. Cracks, more exactly, giant dislocations are\nthus formed. They change the strand thickness by steps of different\nbirefringence colours.

In particular, the combinatorial Morse inequalities of [2]\nare now true of all simplicial complexes.\n  As an application, we prove the following generalized lower bound theorem\n(GLBT) for connected locally tame combinatorial manifolds. If $M$ is such a\nmanifold of dimension $d$, then for $1 \\leq \\ell \\leq \\frac{d-1}{2}$ and any\nfield $\\mathbb{F}, ~ g_{\\ell+1} (M) \\geq \\binom{d+2}{\\ell+1}\n\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^\\ell (-1)^{\\ell-i} \\beta_i (M;\\mathbb{F})$.

A conjecture on the sigma vectors of\ntriangulated homology spheres is proposed, whose validity will imply this GLB\nConjecture for homology manifolds.

At the level of two-body structural\ncorrelations, glassformers show no qualitative change upon vitrifying from a\nsupercooled liquid. Nonetheless the dynamical properties of a glass are so much\nslower that it appears to take on the properties of a solid. While many\ntheories of the glass transition focus on dynamical quantities, a solid's\nresistance to flow is often viewed as a consequence of its structure. Here we\naddress the viewpoint that this remains the case for a glass. Recent\ndevelopments using higher-order measures show a clear emergence of structure\nupon dynamical arrest in a variety of glass formers and offer the tantalising\nhope of a structural mechanism for arrest. However a rigorous fundamental\nidentification of such a causal link between structure and arrest remains\nelusive. We undertake a critical survey of this work in experiments, computer\nsimulation and theory and discuss what might strengthen the link between\nstructure and dynamical arrest.

We propose a new function\napproximation scheme based on a spectral extension of the tensor-train (TT)\ndecomposition. We first define a functional version of the TT decomposition and\nanalyze its properties. We obtain results on the convergence of the\ndecomposition, revealing links between the regularity of the function, the\ndimension of the input space, and the TT ranks. We also show that the\nregularity of the target function is preserved by the univariate functions\n(i.e., the \"cores\") comprising the functional TT decomposition. This result\nmotivates an approximation scheme employing polynomial approximations of the\ncores. For functions with appropriate regularity, the resulting\n\\textit{spectral tensor-train decomposition} combines the favorable\ndimension-scaling of the TT decomposition with the spectral convergence rate of\npolynomial approximations, yielding efficient and accurate surrogates for\nhigh-dimensional functions. To construct these decompositions, we use the\nsampling algorithm \\texttt{TT-DMRG-cross} to obtain the TT decomposition of\ntensors resulting from suitable discretizations of the target function.

We provide a simple recipe to determine black hole mass\nusing solely X-ray spectral data, which can be used as a sanity check for black\nhole mass determination based on indirect optical methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 12:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The urgent call for reducing power consumption while\nmeeting system requirements has motivated increasing research efforts on green\nradio. In this paper, we investigate a new joint spectrum and power allocation\nscheme for a cooperative downlink multi-user system using the frequency\ndivision multiple access scheme, in which arbitrary M base stations (BSs)\ncoordinately allocate their resources to each user equipment (UE). With the\nassumption that multi-BS UE (user being served by multi-BS) would require the\nsame amount of spectrum from these BSs, we conclude that when the number of\nmulti-BS UEs is limited by M-1, the resource allocation scheme can always\nguarantee the minimum overall transmit power consumption while meeting the\nthroughput requirement of each UE and also each BS's power constraint. Then, to\ndecide the clusters of multi-BS UEs and the clusters of individual-BS UEs\n(users being served by individual BSs), we propose a UE-BS association scheme\nand a complexity reduction scheme. Finally, a novel joint spectrum and power\nallocation algorithm is proposed to minimize the total power consumption.\nSimulation results are presented to verify the optimality of the derived\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 12:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-23"}

Furthermore, many of the feasible learning techniques at hand cannot\nmodel a visual class which appears consistent to the human eye. These problems\nhave motivated the use of 1) Unsupervised or supervised clustering as a\npreprocessing step to identify the visual subclasses to be used in a\nmixture-of-experts learning regime. 2) Felzenszwalb et al. part model and other\nworks model mixture assignment with latent variables which is optimized during\nlearning 3) Highly non-linear classifiers which are inherently capable of\nmodelling multi-modal input space but are inefficient at the test time.

These model categories involve generalizations of Gorenstein\nprojective and injective modules that we derive by replacing finitely presented\nmodules by modules of type FP-infinity. Along the way, we extend the perfect\nduality between injective left modules and flat right modules that holds over\nNoetherian rings to general rings by considering weaker notions of injectivity\nand flatness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 14:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-23"}

In this work, the photonic band gap (PBG) feature and the\ncorresponding RI sensitivity of the air-ring type 2D annular PCs (APCs) have\nbeen studied in detail. Such type of 2D PCs can easily and apparently improve\nthe RI sensitivity in comparison with conventional air-hole type 2D PCs that\nhave been widely studied in previous works. This is because the APCs can\nnaturally exhibit suppressed up edge of PBG that can strongly affect the final\nRI sensitivity. In general, an enhanced sensing performance of as high as up to\n2-3 times RI sensitivity can be obtained from pure 2D APCs. Such high RI\nsensitivity is also available in three typical waveguides developed from pure\n2D APCs. Furthermore, a new conception of dual-polarization RI biosensors has\nbeen proposed by defining the RI sensitivity as the difference of crossing\nrelative sensitivity of up-edge PBG between different polarizations.

The authors (i) question the applicability of the\nGinzburg-Landau-Wilson approach to the low-temperature regime, arguing for the\nsuperiority of their model compared to the family of $\\phi^4$ models A and B\nwhose numerically exact solutions we determined both for values of the coupling\nconstant $0<g<\\infty$ and $g=\\infty$. They (ii) report consistency of their\nresults with ours in the critical region and a strong manifestation of\nuniversality, but (iii) point out discrepancies with our results in the region\nbelow $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$. We show here that (i) is unjustified and prove that our\nmodel B with $g=\\infty$ is identical to their spherical model. Hence evidence\nfor the reported universality is already contained in our work. Moreover, the\nresults we determined for anyone of the models A and B for various thicknesses\n$L$ are all numerically exact. (iii) is due to their misinterpretation of our\nresults for the scaling limit.

We examine two different\nflow patterns in the style of the G.O. Roberts flow but with a mean vertical\ncomponent and with internal fixtures that are modelled by regions with\nvanishing flow. These fixtures represent either rods that lie in the center of\nindividual eddies, or internal dividing walls that provide a separation of the\neddies from each other. The fixtures can be made of magnetic material with a\nrelative permeability larger than one which can alter the dynamo behavior. The\ninvestigations are motivated by the widely unknown induction effects of the\nforced helical flow that is used in the core of liquid sodium cooled fast\nreactors, and from the key role of soft iron impellers in the\nVon-K\\'arm\\'an-Sodium (VKS) dynamo.\n  For both examined flow configurations the consideration of magnetic material\nwithin the fluid flow causes a reduction of the critical magnetic Reynolds\nnumber of up to 25%. The development of the growth-rate in the limit of the\nlargest achievable permeabilities suggests no further significant reduction for\neven larger values of the permeability.\n  In order to study the dynamo behavior of systems that consist of tens of\nthousands of helical cells we resort to the mean-field dynamo theory (Krause &\nR\\\"adler 1980) in which the action of the small scale flow is parameterized in\nterms of an $\\alpha$- and $\\beta$-effect.

Two\nalternatives are the truncated exponential distribution (TED) and the cut-off\nexponential distribution (CED). The TED is frequently used in seismic hazard\nanalysis although it has a weak point: When two TEDs with equal parameters\nexcept the upper bound magnitude are mixed, then the resulting distribution is\nnot a TED. Inversely, it is also not possible to split a TED of a seismic\nregion into TEDs of sub-regions with equal parameters except the upper bound\nmagnitude. This weakness is a principal problem as seismic regions are\nconstructed scientific objects and not natural units. We overcome it by the\ngeneralization of the above-mentioned exponential distributions: the\ngeneralized truncated exponential distribution (GTED). Therein, identical\nexponential distributions are mixed by the probability distribution of the\ncorrect cut-off points. This distribution model is flexible in the vicinity of\nthe upper bound magnitude and is equal to the exponential distribution for\nsmaller magnitudes. Additionally, the exponential distributions TED and CED are\nspecial cases of the GTED. We discuss the possible ways of estimating its\nparameters and introduce the normalized spacing for this purpose. Furthermore,\nwe present methods for geographic aggregation and differentiation of the GTED\nand demonstrate the potential and universality of our simple approach by\napplying it to empirical data. The considerable improvement by the GTED in\ncontrast to the TED is indicated by a large difference between the\ncorresponding values of the Akaike information criterion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 15:21:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 17:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We discuss the various possibilities of security within\nthe virtualization layer and we use as a case study \\HelloRootkitty{}, a\nlightweight invariance-enforcing framework which allows an operating system to\nrecover from kernel-level attacks. In addition to \\HelloRootkitty{}, we also\nexplore the use of special hardware chips as a way of further protecting and\nguaranteeing the integrity of a virtualized system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 07:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-26"}

One major factor influencing mistakes and\nfailures is complexity of such tasks, which has been studied extensively in\nprior research. Another important issue which hardly received any attention is\nthe impact of both accidental and intended distractions on users performing\nsecurity-critical tasks. In particular, it is unclear whether, and to what\nextent, unexpected sensory cues (e.g., auditory or visual) can influence user\nbehavior and/or trigger mistakes. Better understanding of the effects of\nintended distractions will help clarify their role in adversarial models. As\npart of the research effort described in this paper, we administered a range of\nnaturally occurring -- yet unexpected -- sounds while study participants\nattempted to perform a security-critical task. We found that, although these\nauditory cues lowered participants' failure rates, they had no discernible\neffect on their task completion times. To this end, we overview some relevant\nliterature that explains these somewhat counter-intuitive findings.\n  Conducting a thorough and meaningful study on user errors requires a large\nnumber of participants, since errors are typically infrequent and should not be\ninstigated more than once per subject. To reduce the effort of running numerous\nsubjects, we developed a novel experimental setup that was fully automated and\nunattended. We discuss our experience with this setup and highlight the pros\nand cons of generalizing its usage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2014 19:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 17:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}
