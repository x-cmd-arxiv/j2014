These favorable results have been attributed to\nadvantageous properties of the corresponding control landscapes, which are free\nfrom local optima if three conditions are met: (1) the quantum system is\ncontrollable, (2) the Jacobian of the map from the control field to the\nevolution operator is full rank, and (3) the control field is not constrained.\nThis paper explores how gradient searches for globally optimal control fields\nare affected by deviations from assumption (2). In some quantum control\nproblems, so-called singular critical points, at which the Jacobian is\nrank-deficient, may exist on the landscape. Using optimal control simulations,\nwe show that search failure is only observed when a singular critical point is\nalso a second-order trap, which occurs if the control problem meets additional\nconditions involving the system Hamiltonian and/or the control objective. All\nknown second-order traps occur at constant control fields, and we also show\nthat they only affect searches that originate very close to them. As a result,\neven when such traps exist on the control landscape, they are unlikely to\naffect well-designed gradient optimizations under realistic searching\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 16:02:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 22:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-18"}

Most of these rates still rely on theoretical\nmodeling. However, modern radioactive ion-beam facilities have allowed to\nmeasure beta half lives of some nuclei on or close to the r-process path. These\ndata indicate that r-process half lives are in general shorter than anticipated\nin the standard theoretical predictions based on the Finite Range Droplet Model\n(FRDM). The data have also served as important constraints for improved\npredictions of half lives based on continuum QRPA calculations on top of the\nenergy-density functional theory. Although these calculations are yet limited\nto spherical nuclei, they include the important r-process waiting point nuclei\nclose to and at the neutron magic numbers $N=50, 82$ and 126. We have studied\nthe impact of these new experimental and theoretical half lives on r-process\nnucleosynthesis within the two astrophysical sites currently favored for the r\nprocess: the neutrino-driven wind from the freshly born neutron star in a\nsupernova explosion and the ejecta of the merger of two neutron stars. We find\nthat the, in general, shorter beta decay rates have several important effects\non the dynamics of r-process nucleosynthesis. At first, the matter flow\novercomes the waiting point nuclei faster enhancing matter transport to heavier\nnuclei. Secondly, the shorter half lives result also in a faster consumption of\nneutrons resulting in important changes of the conditions at freeze-out with\nconsequences for the final r-process abundances. Besides these global effects\non the r-process dynamics, the new half lives also lead to some local changes\nin the abundance distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 16:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-02"}

The scale-invariance protects the tensor\nperturbations from suppressing at large scales and they may have significant\namplitudes to fit BICEP2's result.

Using our results, we (1) compare the\nderived mass distribution of each cluster to its light distribution, (2)\nquantify the cumulative magnification power of the HFF clusters, (3) describe\nhow our models can be used to estimate the magnification and image multiplicity\nof lensed background sources at all redshifts and at any position within the\ncluster cores, and (4) discuss systematic effects and caveats resulting from\nour modeling methods. We specifically investigate the effect of the use of\nspectroscopic and photometric redshift constraints on the uncertainties of the\nresulting models. We find that the photometric redshift estimates of lensed\ngalaxies are generally in excellent agreement with spectroscopic redshifts,\nwhere available. However, the flexibility associated with relaxed redshift\npriors may cause the complexity of large-scale structure that is needed to\naccount for the lensing signal to be underestimated. Our findings thus\nunderline the importance of spectroscopic arc redshifts, or tight photometric\nredshift constraints, for high precision lens models.\n  All products from our best-fit lens models (magnification, convergence,\nshear, deflection field) and model simulations for estimating errors are made\navailable via the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 17:17:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 17:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In this state\nthe only broken symmetry is the $U(1)$ condensate phase. (2) A \"biased ladder\nphase\" (BLP), where the density is higher on one leg than the other. The fluid\nvelocity is higher on the lower density leg, so the net current is zero. In\naddition to the $U(1)$ condensate phase, this has a broken $Z_2$ reflection\nsymmetry.

Classical novae (CNe) are similar systems with only\none such eruption. Many of the so-called 'CNe' are actually RNe for which only\none eruption has been discovered. Since RNe are candidate Type Ia supernova\nprogenitors, it is important to know whether there are enough in our galaxy to\nprovide the supernova rate, and therefore to know how many RNe are masquerading\nas CNe. To quantify this, we collected all available information on the light\ncurves and spectra of a Galactic, time-limited sample of 237 CNe and the 10\nknown RNe, as well as exhaustive discovery efficiency records. We recognize RNe\nas having (a) outburst amplitude smaller than 14.5 - 4.5 * log(t_3), (b)\norbital period >0.6 days, (c) infrared colors of J-H > 0.7 mag and H-K > 0.1\nmag, (d) FWHM of H-alpha > 2000 km/s, (e) high excitation lines, such as Fe X\nor He II near peak, (f) eruption light curves with a plateau, and (g) white\ndwarf mass greater than 1.2 M_solar.

D7-brane deformation\nmoduli are key players in two recently proposed inflationary scenarios: The\nfirst, D7-brane chaotic inflation, is a variant of axion monodromy inflation\nwhich allows for an effective 4d supergravity description. The second,\nfluxbrane inflation, is a stringy version of D-term hybrid inflation. Both\nproposals rely on the fact that D7-brane coordinates enjoy a shift-symmetric\nKahler potential at large complex structure of the Calabi-Yau threefold, making\nthem naturally lighter than other fields. This shift symmetry is inherited from\nthe mirror-dual Type IIA Wilson line on a D6-brane at large volume. The\ninflaton mass can be provided by a tree-level term in the flux superpotential.\nIt induces a monodromy and, if tuned to a sufficiently small value, can give\nrise to a large-field model of inflation. Alternatively, by a sensible flux\nchoice one can completely avoid a tree-level mass term, in which case the\ninflaton potential is induced via loop corrections. The positive vacuum energy\ncan then be provided by a D-term, leading to a small-field model of hybrid\nnatural inflation. In the present paper, we continue to develop a detailed\nunderstanding of the D7-brane moduli space focusing among others on\nshift-symmetry-preserving flux choices, flux-induced superpotential in Type\nIIB/F-theory language, and loop corrections. While the inflationary\napplications represent our main physics motivation, we expect that some of our\nfindings will be useful for other phenomenological issues involving 7-branes in\nType IIB/F-theory constructions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 18:55:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 15:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-27"}

For Binary or Nominal data, Logistic biplots have\nbeen recently developed to extend the classical linear representations for\ncontinuous data. When data are ordinal, linear, binary or nominal logistic\nbiplots are not adequate and techniques as Categorical Principal Component\nAnalysis (CATPCA) or Item Response Theory (IRT) for ordinal items should be\nused instead.\n  In this paper we extend the Biplot to ordinal data. The resulting method is\ntermed Ordinal Logistic Biplot (OLB). Row scores are computed to have ordinal\nlogistic responses along the dimensions and column parameters produce logistic\nresponse surfaces that, projected onto the space spanned by the row scores,\ndefine a linear biplot. A proportional odds model is used, obtaining a\nmultidimensional model known as graded response model in the Item Response\nTheory literature. We study the geometry of such a representation and construct\ncomputational algorithms for the estimation of parameters and the calculation\nof prediction directions. Ordinal Logistic Biplots extend both CATPCA and IRT\nin the sense that gives a graphical representation for IRT similar to the\nbiplot for CATPCA.\n  The main theoretical results are applied to the study of job satisfaction of\ndoctorate (PhD) holders in Spain.

A key\nchallenge is how to harness such devices to perform robust computation. We\npropose reservoir computing as a solution. In reservoir computing, computation\ntakes place by translating the dynamics of an excited medium, called a\nreservoir, into a desired output. This approach eliminates the need for\nexternal control and redundancy, and the programming is done using a\nclosed-form regression problem on the output, which also allows concurrent\nprogramming using a single device.

For a massive scalar field in a fixed de Sitter background,\nthe cosmic no-hair theorem implies that the state of the patch approaches the\nvacuum, where there are no fluctuations. We argue that an analogous conclusion\nholds whenever a patch of de Sitter is embedded in a larger theory with an\ninfinite-dimensional Hilbert space, including semiclassical quantum gravity\nwith false vacua or complementarity in theories with at least one Minkowski\nvacuum. This reasoning provides an escape from the Boltzmann brain problem in\nsuch theories. It also implies that vacuum states do not uptunnel to\nhigher-energy vacua and that perturbations do not decohere while slow-roll\ninflation occurs, suggesting that eternal inflation is much less common than\noften supposed. On the other hand, if a de Sitter patch is a closed system with\na finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there will be Poincare recurrences and\ndynamical Boltzmann fluctuations into lower-entropy states. Our analysis does\nnot alter the conventional understanding of the origin of density fluctuations\nfrom primordial inflation, since reheating naturally generates a high-entropy\nenvironment and leads to decoherence, nor does it affect the existence of\nnon-dynamical vacuum fluctuations such as those that give rise to the Casimir\neffect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 20:13:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 21:02:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 22:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

Past successes, such as the Shannon-Nyquist theorem and recent\nadvances in frame theory, have relied heavily on the application of geometry\nand analysis. The reliance on geometry and analysis means that the results are\ngeometrically rigid. There is a subtle interplay between the topology of the\ndomain of the functions being sampled, and the class of functions themselves.\nBandlimited functions are somewhat limiting; often one wishes to sample from\nother classes of functions. The correct topological tool for modeling all of\nthese situations is the sheaf; a tool which allows local structure and\nconsistency to derive global inferences. This chapter develops a general\nsampling theory for sheaves using the language of exact sequences, recovering\nthe Shannon-Nyquist theorem as a special case. It presents sheaf-theoretic\napproach by solving several different sampling problems involving\nnon-bandlimited functions. The solution to these problems show that the\ntopology of the domain has a varying level of importance depending on the class\nof functions and the specific sampling question being studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 23:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-05"}

We construct a\nlow-energy effective theory that incorporates the proximity effect through an\ninterface contribution containing both normal and anomalous terms and an\nenergy-renormalization matrix. We show that the strength of the\nproximity-induced gap is determined by the transparency of the interface and\nthe amplitude of the low-energy TI states at the interface. Consequently, the\ninduced gap is strongly band-dependent and collapses for bands containing\nstates with low amplitude at the interface. We find that states with energies\nwithin the bulk TI gap have surface-type character and, in the presence of\nproximity-induced or applied bias potentials, have most of their weight near\neither the top or the bottom surface of the nanoribbon. As a result, single\ninterface TI-SC structures are susceptible to experiencing a collapse of the\ninduced gap whenever the chemical potential is far enough from the value\ncorresponding to the bulk TI Dirac point and crosses weakly coupled bands. We\nalso find that changing the chemical potential in single-interface structures\nusing gate potentials may be ineffective, as it does not result in a\nsignificant increase of the induced gap. On the other hand, we find that\nsymmetric structures, such as a TI nanowire sandwiched between two\nsuperconductors, are capable of realizing the full potential of TI-based\nstructures to harbor robust topological superconducting phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2014 00:42:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 16:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-24"}

Rather than obfuscating network\nidentity through higher level protocols, we propose a more direct solution: a\nrouting protocol that allows communication without exposing network identity,\nproviding a strong foundation for Internet privacy, while allowing identity to\nbe defined in those higher level protocols where it adds value.\n  Given current research initiatives advocating \"clean slate\" Internet designs,\nan opportunity exists to design an internetwork layer routing protocol that\ndecouples identity from network location and thereby simplifies the anonymity\nproblem. Recently, Hsiao et al. proposed such a protocol (LAP), but it does not\nprotect the user against a local eavesdropper or an untrusted ISP, which will\nnot be acceptable for many users. Thus, we propose Dovetail, a next-generation\nInternet routing protocol that provides anonymity against an active attacker\nlocated at any single point within the network, including the user's ISP. A\nmajor design challenge is to provide this protection without including an\napplication-layer proxy in data transmission. We address this challenge in path\nconstruction by using a matchmaker node (an end host) to overlap two path\nsegments at a dovetail node (a router). The dovetail then trims away part of\nthe path so that data transmission bypasses the matchmaker. Additional design\nfeatures include the choice of many different paths through the network and the\njoining of path segments without requiring a trusted third party. We develop a\nsystematic mechanism to measure the topological anonymity of our designs, and\nwe demonstrate the privacy and efficiency of our proposal by simulation, using\na model of the complete Internet at the AS-level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2014 06:26:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Jul 2014 07:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

The definitions rely on the\nformal Borel transform and the Laplace transform along an arbitrary direction\nof the complex plane. Given an arc of directions, if a power series is\n1-summable in that arc, then one can attach to it a Borel-Laplace sum, i.e. a\nholomorphic function defined in a large enough sector and asymptotic to that\npower series in Gevrey sense. The second part is an introduction to Ecalle's\nresurgence theory. A power series is said to be resurgent when its Borel\ntransform is convergent and has good analytic continuation properties: there\nmay be singularities but they must be isolated. The analysis of these\nsingularities, through the so-called alien calculus, allows one to compare the\nvarious Borel-Laplace sums attached to the same resurgent 1-summable series.In\nthe context of analytic difference-or-differential equations, this sheds light\non the Stokes phenomenon. A few elementary or classical examples are given a\nthorough treatment (the Euler series, the Stirling series, a less known example\nby Poincar\\'e). Special attention is devoted to non-linear operations:\n1-summable series as well as resurgent series are shown to form algebras which\nare stable by composition. As an application, the resurgent approach to the\nclassification of tangent-to-identity germs of holomorphic diffeomorphisms in\nthe simplest case is included. An example of a class of non-linear differential\nequations giving rise to resurgent solutions is also presented.

Current low\nfrequency interferometers use aperture arrays of fixed dipoles, which are\nsteered electronically on the sky, and have different properties to\nmechanically-steered single apertures, such as reduced sensitivity away from\nzenith, and discrete pointing positions on the sky. Use of two additional\nobserving modes is encouraged: (1) zenith drift, where the pointing centre\nremains fixed at the zenith, and the phase centre tracks the sky, and (2)\ndrift+shift, where the telescope uses discrete pointing centres, and the sky\ndrifts during each pointing. The coherence of measurements in these modes\ndictates the optimal reduction in thermal noise by combination of coherent\nmodes, and the reduction in cosmic variance by combination of incoherent modes\n(views of different patches of the sky).

For more general kernels, the proof relies on a comparison principle.\nFinally, we also show that in the grazing collision limit our results allow to\nrecover known logarithmic Sobolev inequalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2014 09:33:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 18:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-13"}

The larger ($>$0.1) value of G/R ratio\nobserved in a few comets is ascribed to the presence of higher CO$_2$ and CO\nrelative abundances in the cometary coma. We aim to study the effect of CO$_2$\nand CO relative abundances on the observed G/R ratio in comets observed at\nlarge ($>$2 au) heliocentric distances by accounting for important production\nand loss processes of O($^1$S) and O($^1$D) in the cometary coma. Recently we\nhave developed a coupled chemistry-emission model to study photochemistry of\nO($^1$S) and O($^1$D) atoms and the production of green and red-doublet\nemissions in comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp. In the present work we applied the\nmodel to six comets where green and red-doublet emissions are observed when\nthey are beyond 2 au from the Sun. In a water-dominated cometary coma and with\nsignificant ($>$10%) CO$_2$ relative abundance, photodissociation of H$_2$O\nmainly governs the red-doublet emission, whereas CO$_2$ controls the green line\nemission. If a comet has equal composition of CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, then ~50% of\nred-doublet emission intensity is controlled by the photodissociation of\nCO$_2$. The G/R ratio values and green and red-doublet line widths calculated\nby the model are consistent with the observation. Our model calculations\nsuggest that in low gas production rate comets the G/R ratio greater than 0.1\ncan be used to constrain the upper limit of CO$_2$ relative abundance provided\nthe slit-projected area on the coma is larger than the collisional zone. If a\ncomet has equal abundances of CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, then the red-doublet emission\nis significantly ($\\sim$50%) controlled by CO$_2$ photodissociation and thus\nthe G/R ratio is not suitable for estimating CO$_2$ relative abundance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2014 10:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The\nasymptotic performance of the estimator is then discussed in theory and through\nnumerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2014 11:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-05"}

Here, we\nanalyze theoretically dual-probe setups with probe separations in the nanometer\nrange, i.e., in a regime where quantum coherence effects can be observed at low\ntemperatures. In a dual-probe setup the electrons are injected at one probe and\ncollected at the other. The measured conductance reflects the local transport\nproperties on the nanoscale, thereby yielding information complementary to that\nobtained with a standard one-probe setup (the local density-of-states). In this\nwork we develop a real space Green's function method to compute the\nconductance. This requires an extension of the standard calculation schemes,\nwhich typically address a finite sample between the probes. In contrast, the\ndeveloped method makes no assumption on the sample size (e.g., an extended\ngraphene sheet). Applying this method, we study the transport anisotropies in\npristine graphene sheets, and analyze the spectroscopic fingerprints arising\nfrom quantum interference around single-site defects, such as vacancies and\nadatoms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the dual-probe setup is a useful tool\nfor characterizing the electronic transport properties of extended defects or\ndesigned nanostructures. In particular, we show that nanoscale perforations, or\nantidots, in a graphene sheet display Fano-type resonances with a strong\ndependence on the edge geometry of the perforation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2014 11:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-27"}

Then we demonstrate how these new forms of attractors can\nbe embedded within greatest fixed-point computations to design solvers of\nparity games that run in polynomial time but are partial in that they may not\ndecide the winning status of all nodes in the input game.\n  Experimental results show that our partial solvers completely solve\nbenchmarks that were constructed to challenge existing full solvers.

In both sample\nsources, the thick-disk candidate stars characterized by high [$\\alpha$/Fe]\nratios ([$\\alpha$/Fe] $>$ 0.3 in SDSS, [$\\alpha$/Fe] $>$ 0.2 in HARPS) are\nfound to show a positive $\\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\\Delta R_{\\rm g}$, whereas the\nthin-disk candidate stars characterized by lower [$\\alpha$/Fe] ratios show a\nnegative one. Furthermore, we find that the relatively young thin-disk\npopulation characterized by much lower [$\\alpha$/Fe] ratios ([$\\alpha$/Fe] $<$\n0.2 in SDSS, [$\\alpha$/Fe] $<$ 0.1 in HARPS) shows notably a flattening\n$\\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\\Delta R_{\\rm g}$ with decreasing [$\\alpha$/Fe], in contrast to\nthe old one with higher [$\\alpha$/Fe] ratios ([$\\alpha$/Fe] $\\sim$ 0.2 in SDSS,\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] $\\sim$ 0.1 in HARPS). The possible implication for early disk\nevolution is discussed, in the context of galaxy formation accompanying the\nrapid infall of primordial gas on the inner disk region, which can generate a\npositive metallicity gradient, and the subsequent chemical evolution of the\ndisk, which results in a flattening effect of a metallicity gradient at later\nepochs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2014 14:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Among the most\ngeneral ones are the abstract dialectical frameworks, also known as the ADFs.\nThey make use of the so-called acceptance conditions to represent arbitrary\nrelations. This level of abstraction brings not only new challenges, but also\nrequires addressing existing problems in the field. One of the most\ncontroversial issues, recognized not only in argumentation, concerns the\nsupport cycles. In this paper we introduce a new method to ensure acyclicity of\nthe chosen arguments and present a family of extension-based semantics built on\nit. We also continue our research on the semantics that permit cycles and fill\nin the gaps from the previous works. Moreover, we provide ADF versions of the\nproperties known from the Dung setting.

Neutrosophy is a relatively new field of\nscience which can be used to mathematically represent triads of concepts. These\ntriads include truth, indeterminacy and falsehood, and so also positivity,\nneutrality and negativity. Thus a conventional semantic net has been extended\nin this paper using neutrosophy into a Polar Fuzzy Neutrosophic Semantic Net. A\nPolar Fuzzy Neutrosophic Semantic Net has been implemented in MATLAB and has\nbeen used to illustrate a polar sentence in English language. The paper\ndemonstrates a method for the representation of polarity in a computers memory.\nThus, polar concepts can be applied to imbibe a machine such as a robot, with\nemotions, making machine emotion representation possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2014 15:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-05"}

The first evidence\nof silicate dust in a quasar absorption system (QAS) was provided through our\ndetection of the 10 micron silicate feature in the z=0.52 absorber toward the\nquasar AO 0235+164. We present results from 2 follow-up programs using archival\nSpitzer Space Telescope infrared spectra to study the interstellar silicate\ndust grain properties in a total of 13 QASs at 0.1<z<1.4. We find clear\ndetections of the 10 micron silicate feature in the QASs studied. We also\ndetect the 18 micron silicate feature in the sources with adequate spectral\ncoverage. We find variations in the breadth, peak wavelength, and substructure\nof the 10 micron interstellar silicate absorption features among the absorbers.\nThis suggests that the silicate dust grain properties in these distant galaxies\nmay differ relative to one another, and relative to those in the Milky Way. We\nalso find suggestions in several sources, based on comparisons with\nlaboratory-derived profiles from the literature, that the silicate dust grains\nmay be significantly more crystalline than those in the amorphous Milky Way\nISM. This is particularly evident in the z=0.89 absorber toward the quasar PKS\n1830-211, where substructure near 10 micron is consistent with a crystalline\nolivine composition. If confirmed, these grain property variations may have\nimplications for both dust and galaxy evolution over the past 9 Gyrs, and for\nthe commonly-made assumption that high-redshift dust is similar to local dust.\nWe also discuss indications of trends between silicate dust absorption strength\nand both carbonaceous dust properties and gas-phase metal properties, such as\nthe gas velocity spread, determined from UV/optical spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2014 15:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-05"}

The\nhorizon in the sense of vanishing of the speed of light still exists in the\nradial direction. It is located at 2.60 times of the Schwarzschild radius. This\nradius corresponds to the size of a black hole, as well as the photon sphere\nradius. The metric can be used to calculate general relativistic predictions in\nhigher order for any process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 18:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}
