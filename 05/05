By allowing an arbitrary information exchange pattern, the\nconsidered channel model is a unified one.

The\nobserved distribution of GC colors within massive early-type galaxies in the\nACS Virgo Cluster Survey (ACSVCS) reveals a multi-modal shape, which likely\ncorresponds to a multi-modal metallicity distribution. We present a simple\nmodel for the formation and disruption of GCs that aims to match the ACSVCS\ndata. This model tests the hypothesis that GCs are formed during major mergers\nof gas-rich galaxies and inherit the metallicity of their hosts. To trace\nmerger events, we use halo merger trees extracted from a large cosmological\nN-body simulation. We select 20 halos in the mass range of $2\\times 10^{12}$ to\n$7\\times 10^{13}M_\\odot$ and match them to 19 Virgo galaxies with K-band\nluminosity between $3\\times 10^{10}$ and $3\\times 10^{11}L_\\odot$. To set the\n[Fe/H] abundances, we use an empirical galaxy mass-metallicity relation. We\nfind that a minimal merger ratio of 1:3 best matches the observed cluster\nmetallicity distribution. A characteristic bimodal shape appears because\nmetal-rich GCs are produced by late mergers between massive halos, while\nmetal-poor GCs are produced by collective merger activities of less massive\nhosts at early times. The model outcome is robust to alternative prescriptions\nfor cluster formation rate throughout cosmic time, but a gradual evolution of\nthe mass-metallicity relation with redshift appears to be necessary to match\nthe observed cluster metallicities.

However, the\nfreedom in the choice of the functional forms of $f(R)$ gives rise to the\nproblem of how to constrain and break the degeneracy among these gravity\ntheories on theoretical and/or observational grounds. In this paper to proceed\nfurther with the investigation on the potentialities, difficulties and\nlimitations of $f(R)$ gravity, we examine the question as to whether the future\ndynamics can be used to break the degeneracy between $f(R)$ gravity theories by\ninvestigating the future dynamics of spatially homogeneous and isotropic dust\nflat models in two $f(R)$ gravity theories, namely the well known $f(R) = R +\n\\alpha R^{n}$ gravity and another by A. Aviles et al., whose motivation comes\nfrom the cosmographic approach to $f(R)$ gravity. To this end we perform a\ndetailed numerical study of the future dynamic of these flat model in these\ntheories taking into account the recent constraints on the cosmological\nparameters made by the Planck team. We show that besides being powerful for\ndiscriminating between $f(R)$ gravity theories, the future dynamics technique\ncan also be used to determine the fate of the Universe in the framework of\nthese $f(R)$ gravity theories. Moreover, there emerges from our numerical\nanalysis that if we do not invoke a dark energy component with\nequation-of-state parameter $\\omega < -1$ one still has dust flat FLRW solution\nwith a big rip, if gravity deviates from general relativity via $f(R) = R +\n\\alpha R^n $.

Matrix factorization technique is\none of the most widely employed collaborative filtering techniques in the\nresearch of recommender systems due to its effectiveness and efficiency in\ndealing with very large user-item rating matrices. Recently, based on the\nintuition that additional information provides useful insights for matrix\nfactorization techniques, several recommendation algorithms have utilized\nadditional information to improve the performance of matrix factorization\nmethods. However, the majority focus on dealing with the cold start user\nproblem and ignore the cold start item problem.

In univariate extreme\nvalue theory, we model the data by a suitable distribution from the general\nmax-domain of attraction (MAD) characterized by its tail index; there are three\nbroad classes of tails -- the Pareto type, the Weibull type and the Gumbel\ntype. The simplest and most common estimator of the tail index is the Hill\nestimator that works only for Pareto type tails and has a high bias; it is also\nhighly non-robust in presence of outliers with respect to the assumed model.\nThere have been some recent attempts to produce asymptotically unbiased or\nrobust alternative to the Hill estimator; however all the robust alternatives\nwork for any one type of tail. This paper proposes a new general estimator of\nthe tail index that is both robust and has smaller bias under all the three\ntail types compared to the existing robust estimators. This essentially\nproduces a robust generalization of the estimator proposed by Matthys and\nBeirlant (2003) under the same model approximation through a suitable\nexponential regression framework using the density power divergence.

The chemistry is treated by a unified microscopic-macroscopic Monte\nCarlo approach that includes photon penetration and bulk diffusion. To\ndetermine the significance of these two processes, we simulate the chemistry\nwith three different models. In Model 1, we use an exponential treatment to\nfollow how photons penetrate and photodissociate ice species throughout the\ngrain mantle. Moreover, the products of photodissociation are allowed to\ndiffuse via bulk diffusion and react within the ice mantle. Model 2 is similar\nto Model 1 but with a slower bulk diffusion rate. A reference Model 0, which\nonly allows photodissociation reactions to occur on the top two layers, is also\nsimulated. Photodesorption is assumed to occur from the top two layers in all\nthree models. We found that the abundances of major stable species in grain\nmantles do not differ much among these three models, and the results of our\nsimulation for the abundances of these species agree well with observations.\nLikewise, the abundances of gas-phase species in the three models do not vary.\nHowever, the abundances of radicals in grain mantles can differ by up to two\norders of magnitude depending upon the degree of photon penetration and the\nbulk diffusion of photodissociation products. We also found that complex\nmolecules can be formed at temperatures as low as 10 K in all three models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 09:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Only\nquasisymmetric stellarators are intrinsically ambipolar, but exact\nquasisymmetry is impossible to achieve in non-axisymmetric toroidal\nconfigurations. By calculating the violation of intrinsic ambipolarity due to\ndeviations from quasisymmetry, one can derive criteria to assess when a\nstellarator can be considered quasisymmetric in practice, i.e. when the flow\ndamping is weak enough. Let us denote by $\\alpha$ a small parameter that\ncontrols the size of a perturbation to an exactly quasisymmetric magnetic\nfield. Recently, it has been shown that if the gradient of the perturbation is\nsufficiently small, the flux-surface averaged radial electric current scales as\n$\\alpha^2$ for any value of the collisionality. It was also argued that when\nthe gradient of the perturbation is large, the quadratic scaling is replaced by\na more unfavorable one. In this paper, perturbations with large gradients are\nrigorously treated. In particular, it is proven that for low collisionality a\nperturbation with large gradient yields, at best, an $O(|\\alpha|)$ deviation\nfrom quasisymmetry. Heuristic estimations in the literature incorrectly\npredicted an $O(|\\alpha|^{3/2})$ deviation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 09:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Our approach relies\non successive applications of the `outer dynamics' along homoclinic orbits to a\nnormally hyperbolic invariant manifold. The information on the outer dynamics\nis encoded by a geometrically defined map, referred to as the `scattering map'.\n  We find pseudo-orbits of the scattering map that keep advancing in some\nprivileged direction. Then we use the recurrence property of the `inner\ndynamics', restricted to the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold, to return\nto those pseudo-orbits. Finally, we apply topological methods to show the\nexistence of true orbits that follow the successive applications of the two\ndynamics.\n  This method differs, in several crucial aspects, from earlier works. Unlike\nthe well known `two-dynamics' approach, the method we present relies on the\nouter dynamics alone. There are virtually no assumptions on the inner dynamics,\nas its invariant objects (e.g., primary and secondary tori, lower dimensional\nhyperbolic tori and their stable/unstable manifolds, Aubry-Mather sets) are not\nused at all.\n  The method applies to unperturbed Hamiltonians of arbitrary degrees of\nfreedom that are not necessarily convex. In addition, this mechanism is easy to\nverify (analytically or numerically) in concrete examples, as well as to\nestablish diffusion in generic systems.\n  We include several applications, such as bridging large gaps in a priori\nunstable models in any dimension, and establishing diffusion in cases when the\ninner dynamics is a non-twist map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 11:58:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2014 16:52:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 00:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

We\nconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction and\npolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possible\nsystematic effects. We find that the maximum observed dust polarization\nfraction is high (pmax > 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dust\ncolumn density (AV < 1mag) regions. There is a systematic decrease in the dust\npolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret the\nfeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignment\npredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. We also\ncharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angle\ndispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,\nthe polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated by\nfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field sky\nprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust column\ndensity. The polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with the\ndispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likely\ndue to fluctuations in the 3D magnetic field orientation along the line of\nsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.We also compare the dust\nemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the Planck LFI,\nwith low-frequency radio data, and with Faraday rotation measurements of\nextragalactic sources. The two polarized components are globally similar in\nstructure along the plane and notably in the Fan and North Polar Spur regions.\nA detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust and\ncosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirms\nthat much of the variation observed in the Planck data is due to the 3D\nstructure of the magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 12:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-15"}

Comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellar\npolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique new\ndiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. Using\nancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,\nwe obtain the degree of polarization, $p_V$ , and the optical depth in the V\nband to the star, $\\tau_V$.

In a forward approach, the model is able to simulate the plume dynamics\nfrom prescribed input flow conditions and generate the corresponding synthetic\nthermal infrared (TIR) image, allowing a comparison with field-based\nobservations. An inversion procedure is then developed to retrieve ash plume\nproperties from TIR images.\n  The adopted fluid-dynamic model is based on a one-dimensional, stationary\ndescription of a self-similar (top-hat) turbulent plume, for which an\nasymptotic analytical solution is obtained. The electromagnetic\nemission/absorption model is based on the Schwarzschild's equation and on Mie's\ntheory for disperse particles, assuming that particles are coarser than the\nradiation wavelength and neglecting scattering. [...]\n  Application of the inversion procedure to an ash plume at Santiaguito volcano\n(Guatemala) has allowed us to retrieve the main plume input parameters, namely\nthe initial radius $b_0$, velocity $U_0$, temperature $T_0$, gas mass ratio\n$n_0$, entrainment coefficient $k$ and their related uncertainty. Moreover,\ncoupling with the electromagnetic model, we have been able to obtain a reliable\nestimate of the equivalent Sauter diameter $d_s$ of the total particle size\ndistribution.\n  The presented method is general and, in principle, can be applied to the\nspatial distribution of particle concentration and temperature obtained by any\nfluid-dynamic model, either integral or multidimensional, stationary or\ntime-dependent, single or multiphase. The method discussed here is fast and\nrobust, thus indicating potential for applications to real-time estimation of\nash mass flux and particle size distribution, which is crucial for model-based\nforecasts of the volcanic ash dispersal process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 13:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-20"}

We investigate a model where the central supermassive black hole Sgr A*\nis radiatively coupled to a fragmented circumnuclear disc (CND), an elliptical\ntwisted ring representative of the central molecular zone (CMZ), and the two\nmain, bright molecular clouds Sgr B2 and Sgr C. 8 -- 35 keV integrated\npolarization mapping reveals that Sgr B2 and Sgr C, situated at the two sides\nof the CMZ, present the highest polarization degrees (66.5 and 47.8 per cent\nrespectively), both associated with a polarization position angle psi = 90deg\n(normal to the scattering plane). The CND shows a lower polarization degree,\n1.0 per cent with psi = -20.5deg, tracing the inclination of the CND with\nrespect to the Galactic plane. The CMZ polarization is spatially variable. We\nalso consider a range of spatial locations for Sgr A* and the reprocessing\nmedia, and investigate how the modeled three-dimensional geometry influences\nthe resulting GC polarization. The two reflection nebulae are found to always\nproduce high polarization degrees (>> 10 per cent).

Today, road accidents\nconstitute the eighth leading cause of death. The escalation of technology has\npropelled new ways in which driver's senses may be augmented. The enclosed\naspect of a car, allied with the configuration of the controls and displays\ndirected towards the driver, offer significant advantages for augmented reality\n(AR) systems when considering the amount of immersion it can provide to the\nuser. In addition, the inherent mobility and virtually unlimited power autonomy\ntransform cars into perfect mobile computing platforms.

However, when the\nnumber of measurements per subject ($p$) is much larger than the number of\nsubjects ($n$), the challenge of calculating and storing the leading principal\ncomponents from each bootstrap sample can be computationally infeasible. To\naddress this, we outline methods for fast, exact calculation of bootstrap\nprincipal components, eigenvalues, and scores. Our methods leverage the fact\nthat all bootstrap samples occupy the same $n$-dimensional subspace as the\noriginal sample. As a result, all bootstrap principal components are limited to\nthe same $n$-dimensional subspace and can be efficiently represented by their\nlow dimensional coordinates in that subspace. Several uncertainty metrics can\nbe computed solely based on the bootstrap distribution of these low dimensional\ncoordinates, without calculating or storing the $p$-dimensional bootstrap\ncomponents.

In contrast to the local\nuniverse, core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are the only source of\nthermally-condensed dust. Because of the low initial dust-to-gas mass ratio,\ngrain destruction rates are low, so that CCSNe are net producers of\ninterstellar dust. Galaxies with large initial gas mass or high mass infall\nrate will therefore have a more rapid net rate of dust production comported to\ngalaxies with lower gas mass, even at the same star formation rate. The dust\ncomposition is dominated by silicates, which exhibit a strong rise in the UV\nopacity near the Lyman break. This \"silicate-UV break\" may be confused with the\nLyman break, resulting in a misidentification of a galaxies' photometric\nredshift. In this paper we demonstrate these effects by analyzing the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) of MACS1149-JD, a lensed galaxy at z=9.6. A potential\n2mm counterpart of MACS1149-JD has been identified with GISMO.

Fuzzy\noptimization deals with finding the values of input parameters of a complex\nsimulated system which result in desired output. This paper presents a MATLAB\nsimulation of fuzzy logic traffic controller for controlling flow of traffic in\nisolated intersections. This controller is based on the waiting time and queue\nlength of vehicles at present green phase and vehicles queue lengths at the\nother phases. The controller controls the traffic light timings and phase\ndifference to ascertain sebaceous flow of traffic with least waiting time and\nqueue length. In this paper, the isolated intersection model used consists of\ntwo alleyways in each approach. Every outlook has different value of queue\nlength and waiting time, systematically, at the intersection. The maximum value\nof waiting time and vehicle queue length has to be selected by using proximity\nsensors as inputs to controller for the ameliorate control traffic flow at the\nintersection.

In contrast to what is observed in blue compact dwarfs\n(BCDs) and local giant HII regions in the Milky Way (NGC 3603) and the\nMagellanic Clouds (30 Doradus and N 66), the relative PAH band strengths in\nISFOs correspond to models with a significant PAH ion fraction (<50%) and\nbright emission from large PAHs (~100 carbon atoms).
