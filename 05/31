Our results demonstrate that, consistent with phenomenological\ntheory, clamping by the substrate reduces the maximum $\\Delta T$ compared to\nbulk BaTiO$_3$. On the other hand, compressive misfit-strain leads to a strong\nincrease of $\\Delta T$ and shifts the maximum of the electrocaloric effect to\nhigher temperatures. A rather small compressive strain of $-0.75$% is\nsufficient to obtain a $\\Delta T$ that is larger than the corresponding bulk\nvalue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2014 16:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-02"}

The method involves\nall-atom molecular dynamics simulations combined with the umbrella sampling\ntechnique. The profiled nature of the density of water with the strongly\nadsorbed first layer affects the approach of amino acids to the surface and\ngenerates either repulsion or weak binding. The largest binding energy is found\nfor tyrosine interacting with the surface in which the Zn ions are at the top.\nIt is equal to 7 kJ/mol which is comparable to that of the hydrogen bonds in a\nprotein. This makes the adsorption of amino acids onto the ZnO surface much\nweaker than onto the well studied surface of gold. Under vacuum, binding\nenergies are more than 40 times stronger (for one of the surfaces). The precise\nmanner in which water molecules interact with a given surface influences the\nbinding energies in a way that depends on the surface. Among the four\nconsidered surfaces the one with Zn at the top is recognized as binding almost\nall amino acids with an average binding energy of 2.60 kJ/mol. Another (O at\nthe top) is non-binding for most amino acids. For binding situations the\naverage energy is 0.66 kJ/mol. The remaining two surfaces bind nearly as many\namino acids as they do not and the average binding energies are 1.46 and 1.22\nkJ/mol. For all of the surfaces the binding energies vary between amino acids\nsignificantly: the dispersion in the range of 68-154% of the mean. A small\nprotein is shown to adsorb onto ZnO only intermittently and with only a small\ndeformation. Various adsorption events lead to different patterns in mobilities\nof amino acids within the protein.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2014 16:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-02"}

In particular, it\nexhibits a nonequilibrium, discontinuous transition between a reactive and a CO\npoisoned phase. If one allows a nonzero rate of CO desorption ($k$), the line\nof phase transitions terminates at a critical point ($k_{c}$). In this work,\ninstead of restricting the CO and atomic oxygen (O) to react to form carbon\ndioxide (CO$_{2}$) only when they are adsorbed in close proximity, we consider\na modified model that includes an adjustable probability for adsorbed CO and O\natoms located far apart on the lattice to react. We employ large-scale Monte\nCarlo simulations for system sizes up to 240$\\times$240 lattice sites, using\nthe crossing of fourth-order cumulants to study the critical properties of this\nsystem.

Semantic\ndecomposition is the task of understanding the meaning of an individual word by\ndecomposing it into various aspects (factors, constituents, components) that\nare latent in the meaning of the word. We take a distributional approach to\nsemantics, in which a word is represented by a context vector. Much recent work\nhas considered the problem of recognizing compositions and decompositions, but\nwe tackle the more difficult generation problem. For simplicity, we focus on\nnoun-modifier bigrams and noun unigrams. A test for semantic composition is,\ngiven context vectors for the noun and modifier in a noun-modifier bigram (\"red\nsalmon\"), generate a noun unigram that is synonymous with the given bigram\n(\"sockeye\"). A test for semantic decomposition is, given a context vector for a\nnoun unigram (\"snifter\"), generate a noun-modifier bigram that is synonymous\nwith the given unigram (\"brandy glass\"). With a vocabulary of about 73,000\nunigrams from WordNet, there are 73,000 candidate unigram compositions for a\nbigram and 5,300,000,000 (73,000 squared) candidate bigram decompositions for a\nunigram. We generate ranked lists of potential solutions in two passes. A fast\nunsupervised learning algorithm generates an initial list of candidates and\nthen a slower supervised learning algorithm refines the list. We evaluate the\ncandidate solutions by comparing them to WordNet synonym sets. For\ndecomposition (unigram to bigram), the top 100 most highly ranked bigrams\ninclude a WordNet synonym of the given unigram 50.7% of the time.

Furthermore, the flow is nonlinear (unlike the original\nrotation), and a suitably chosen Poincare return map satisfies a twist\ncondition.\n  The round-off perturbation introduces KAM-type phenomena: we identify the\nunperturbed curves which survive the perturbation, and show that they form a\nset of positive density in the phase space.

In the domains where the\nnonlinearity remains, numerical evidence suggests that the distribution of the\nperiods of orbits is consistent with that of random dynamics, whereas in the\nabsence of nonlinearity, the fluctuations result in intricate discrete resonant\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2014 16:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-02"}

The two-way coupling between stress and concentration of lithium in\nsilicon, including the possibility of plastic deformation, is taken into\naccount and two particular cases are considered. First, the cylindrical\nparticle is assumed to be free of surface traction and second, the axial\ndeformation of the cylinder is prevented. In both cases plastic stretches\ndevelop through the entire cylinder and not just near the surface as is\ncommonly found in spherical anode particles. It is shown that the stress\nevolution depends both on the lithiation rate and the external constraints.\nFurthermore, as the cylinder expands during lithiation it can develop a\ncompressive axial stress large enough to induce buckling, which in turn may\nlead to mechanical failure. An explicit criterion for swelling-induced buckling\nobtained as a modification of the classical Euler buckling criterion shows the\ncompetition between the stabilising effect of radius increase and the\ndestabilising effect of axial stress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2014 17:33:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2014 15:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

In this scenario, radiation is produced\nduring the inflation epoch and reheating is avoided. The main question arises\nthat what is the origin of warm inflation in 4D universe? We answer to this\nquestion in brane-antibrane system. We propose a model that allows all\ncosmological parameters like the scale factor a, the Hubble parameter H and\nphantom energy density depend on the equation of state parameter in transverse\ndimension between two branes. Thus, an enhancement in these parameters can be a\nsignature of some evolutions in extra dimension. In our model, the expansion of\n4D universe is controlled by the separation distance between branes and evolves\nfrom non-phantom phase to phantom one. Consequently, phantom-dominated era of\nthe universe accelerates and ends up in big-rip singularity. Also, we show that\nas the tachyon potential increases, the effect of interaction between branes on\nthe 4D universe expansion becomes systematically more effective, because at\nhigher energies there exists more channels for flowing energy from extra\ndimension to other four dimensions. Finally, we test our model against WMAP and\nPlanck data and obtain the ripping time. According to experimental data,\n$N\\simeq 50$ case leads to $n_{s}\\simeq 0.96$, where \\emph{N} and $n_{s}$ are\nthe number e-folds and the spectral index respectively.

Extending and amending our previous work on the subject, we\ncalculate the 3He-3H binding energy difference both perturbatively (using\nproperly normalized trinucleon wave functions) and non-perturbatively by\nresumming all O(alpha) Coulomb diagrams in the doublet channel. Our\nnonperturbative result agrees well with a calculation that involves the full\noff-shell Coulomb T-matrix. Carefully examining the cutoff-dependence in the\ndoublet channel, we present numerical evidence for a new three-nucleon\ncounterterm being necessary at next-to-leading order if Coulomb effects are\nincluded. Indeed, such a term has recently been identified analytically. We\nfurthermore make a case for a simplified Coulomb power counting that is\nconsistent throughout the bound-state and scattering regimes. Finally, using a\n\"partially screened\" full off-shell Coulomb T-matrix, we investigate the\nimportance of higher-order Coulomb corrections in low-energy quartet-channel\nscattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2014 19:27:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 18:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-22"}

For stars like the Sun this is\nrelatively easy because the mode frequencies follow a regular pattern described\nby a well-founded asymptotic relation. When a solar like star evolves off the\nmain sequence and onto the red giant branch its structure changes dramatically\nresulting in changes in the frequency pattern of the modes. We follow the\nevolution of the adiabatic frequency pattern from the main sequence to near the\ntip of the red giant branch for a series of models.

To support our\ninvestigation we analyze almost four years of Kepler data of the most luminous\nstars in the field (late K and early M type) and find that their frequency\nspectra indeed show a triplet pattern dominated by dipole modes even for the\nmost luminous stars in our sample.

Finally, we find `new ridges'\nof non-radial modes with frequencies below the fundamental mode in our model\ncalculations, and we speculate they are related to f modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2014 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Although small improvements in the CMB\nconstraints are expected, the next frontier of precision will come from future\nlarge-scale surveys of the galaxy distribution. The advantage of such surveys\nis that they can measure many more modes than the CMB -- in particular,\nforthcoming radio surveys with the SKA will cover huge volumes. Radio continuum\nsurveys deliver the largest volumes, but with the disadvantage of no redshift\ninformation. In order to mitigate this, we use two additional observables.\nFirst, the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect -- the cross-correlation of the radio\nnumber counts with the CMB temperature anisotropies -- helps to reduce\nsystematics on the large scales that are sensitive to non-Gaussianity. Second,\noptical data allows for cross-identification in order to gain some redshift\ninformation. We show that, while the single redshift bin case can provide a\nsigma(fNL) ~ 20, and is therefore not competitive with current and future\nconstraints on non-Gaussianity, a tomographic analysis could improve the\nconstraints by an order of magnitude, even with only two redshift bins. A huge\nimprovement is provided by the addition of high-redshift sources, so having\ncross-ID for high-z galaxies and an even higher-z radio tail is key to enabling\nvery precise measurements of fNL. Our results show that SKA continuum surveys\ncould provide constraints competitive with CMB and forthcoming optical surveys,\npotentially allowing a measurement of sigma(fNL) ~ 1 to be made. Moreover,\nthese measurements would act as a useful check of results obtained with other\nprobes at other redshift ranges with other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2014 20:06:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 07:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We first re-examine the\ndynamics of freezeout during reheating. Next we apply a Bayesian approach to\nstudy the parameter space of the MSSM with ten free parameters, the CMSSM and\nthe singlino-dominated regions of the NMSSM. In each case we find dramatic\ndepartures from the usually considered regime of high $T_R$, with important\nimplications for direct detection dark matter searches. In the MSSM we examine\nWIMP mass range up to ~5 TeV, and find regions of bino dark matter over the\nwhole mass range, and of higgsino dark matter with mass over a similar range\nbut starting from the ~1 TeV value of the standard high $T_R$ scenario. We show\nthat the prospects for bino detection strongly depend on $T_R$, while the\nhiggsino is for the most part detectable by future one-tonne detectors. The\nwino, which is excluded in the standard scenario, becomes allowed again if its\nmass is roughly above 3.5 TeV, and can be detectable. In the CMSSM, the bino\nand higgsino mass ranges become more constrained although detection prospects\nremain similar. In the Next-to-MSSM at low enough $T_R$ wide ranges of\nsinglino-dominated parameter space of the model become cosmologically allowed.\nWe also study the contribution to the DM relic density from direct and cascade\ndecays of the inflaton.

In contrast with the single\npolymer system we find that the half-plane and infinite slit limits coincide.\nWe understand this result in part due to the tethering of polymers on both\nwalls of the slit.\n  We also analyse the entropic force exerted by the polymers on the walls of\nthe slit. Again the results differ significantly from single polymer models. In\na single polymer system both attractive and repulsive regimes were seen,\nwhereas in our two walk model only repulsive forces are observed. We do,\nhowever, see that the range of the repulsive force is dependent on the\nparameter values. This variation can be explained by the adsorption of the\nwalks on opposite walls of the slit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2014 21:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Following their work, it is\nwell-known that entrywise functions preserving Loewner positivity in all\ndimensions are precisely the absolutely monotonic functions. However, there are\nstrong theoretical and practical motivations to study functions preserving\npositivity in a fixed dimension $n$. Such characterizations for a fixed value\nof $n$ are difficult to obtain, and in fact are only known in the $2 \\times 2$\ncase. In this paper, using a novel and intuitive approach, we study entrywise\nfunctions preserving positivity on distinguished submanifolds inside the cone\nobtained by imposing rank constraints. These rank constraints are prevalent in\napplications, and provide a natural way to relax the elusive original problem\nof preserving positivity in a fixed dimension.

Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits\nforming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti-k$_t$\nalgorithm with distance parameters $R=0.4$ or $R=0.6$, and are calibrated using\nMC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences\nbetween data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty\nare estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the\ntransverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a\nphoton or a Z boson, for $20 < p_T < 1000$ GeV and pseudorapidities\n$|\\eta|<4.5$. The effect of multiple proton-proton interactions is corrected\nfor, and an uncertainty is evaluatedusing in situ techniques. The smallest JES\nuncertainty of less than $1 %$ is found in the central calorimeter\nregion($|\\eta|<1.2$) for jets with $55< p_T< 500$ GeV. For central jets at\nlower $p_T$, the uncertainty is about $3 %$. A consistent JES estimate is found\nusing measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in\nproton-proton collisionsand test-beam data, which also provide the estimate for\n$p_{T,jet} > 1$ TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet\n$p_T$ balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value\nof $6%$ for low-$p_T$ jets at $|\\eta|=4.5$.\n  Additional JES uncertainties due to specific event topologies, such as\nclose-by jets or selections of event samples with an enhanced content of jets\noriginating from light quarks or gluons, are also discussed. The magnitude of\nthese uncertainties depends on the event sample used in a given physics\nanalysis, but typically amounts to $0.5%$ to $3%$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 May 2014 13:00:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 09:33:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 16:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-29"}
