With this, we qualitatively deduced\nstructures of the coronal magnetic field. The 3D electron density analysis is\ncomplemented by the 3D STEREO/EUVI emissivity in the 195 A band obtained by\ntomography for the same CR. A global 3D MHD model of the solar corona was used\nto relate the reconstructed 3D density and emissivity to open/closed magnetic\nfield structures.

For about half of them, a significant misalignment is detected, and\nretrograde planets have been observed. This challenges scenarios of the\nformation of hot Jupiters.\n  In order to better constrain formation models, we relate the distribution of\nthe real spin-orbit angle $\\Psi$ to the projected one $\\beta$. Then, a\ncomparison with the observations is relevant.\n  We analyse the geometry of the problem to link analytically the projected\nangle $\\beta$ to the real spin-orbit angle $\\Psi$. The distribution of $\\Psi$\nexpected in various models is taken from the literature, or derived with a\nsimplified model and Monte-Carlo simulations in the case of the disk-torquing\nmechanism.\n  An easy formula to compute the probability density function (PDF) of $\\beta$\nknowing the PDF of $\\Psi$ is provided. All models tested here look compatible\nwith the observed distribution beyond 40 degrees, which is so far poorly\nconstrained by only 18 observations. But only the disk-torquing mechanism can\naccount for the excess of aligned hot Jupiters, provided that the torquing is\nnot always efficient. This is the case if the exciting binaries have semi-major\naxes as large as 10000 AU.\n  Based on comparison with the set of observations available today, scattering\nmodels and the Kozai cycle with tidal friction models can not be solely\nresponsible for the production of all hot Jupiters. Conversely, the presently\nobserved distribution of the spin-orbit angles is compatible with most hot\nJupiters having been transported by smooth migration inside a proto-planetary\ndisk, itself possibly torqued by a companion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 16:51:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 15:45:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

This formula can be understood as a factorization of the\nSchur function for an orthogonal polynomial modification of a measure on the\nunit circle. No such formula is known in the case of matrix-valued measures.\nThis constitutes the main obstacle to generalize Khrushchev theory to the\nmatrix-valued setting which we overcome in this paper.\n  It was recently discovered that orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle and\ntheir matrix-valued versions play a significant role in the study of quantum\nwalks, the quantum mechanical analogue of random walks. In particular, Schur\nfunctions turn out to be the mathematical tool which best codify the return\nproperties of a discrete time quantum system, a topic in which Khrushchev's\nformula has profound and surprising implications. We will show that this\nconnection between Schur functions and quantum walks is behind a simple proof\nof Khrushchev's formula via `quantum' diagrammatic techniques for CMV matrices.\nThis does not merely give a quantum meaning to a known mathematical result,\nsince the diagrammatic proof also works for matrix-valued measures. Actually,\nthis path counting approach is so fruitful that it provides different matrix\ngeneralizations of Khrushchev's formula, some of them new even in the case of\nscalar measures.\n  Furthermore, the path counting approach allows us to identify the properties\nof CMV matrices which are responsible for Khrushchev's formula. On the one\nhand, this helps to formalize and unify the diagrammatic proofs using simple\noperator theory tools. On the other hand, this is the origin of our main result\nwhich extends Khrushchev's formula beyond the CMV case, as a factorization rule\nfor Schur functions related to general unitary operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 18:48:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 11:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-31"}

However, in models\nwith an extended Higgs sector the diagonal Higgs couplings to up-quarks,\ndown-quarks and charged leptons, could lay on different lines, while\nnon-diagonal flavor-violating Higgs couplings could appear too. We describe\nthese possibilities within the context of multi-Higgs doublet models that\nemploy the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism to generate the Yukawa hierarchies.\nFurthermore, one of the doublets can be chosen to be of the inert type, which\nprovides a viable dark matter candidate.

As it is\ncurrently unknown if these galaxies are representative of the massive galaxy\npopulation, we here use the FourStar Galaxy Evolution (ZFOURGE) Survey to\ncreate a stellar mass-limited sample at $z=3-4$. Uniquely, ZFOURGE uses deep\nnear-infrared medium-bandwidth filters to derive accurate photometric redshifts\nand stellar population properties. The mass-complete sample consists of 57\ngalaxies with log M $>10.6$, reaching below $M^{\\star}$ at $z=3-4$.\n  On average, the massive $z=3-4$ galaxies are extremely faint in the observed\noptical with median $R_{tot}^{AB}=27.48\\pm0.41$ (restframe\n$M_{1700}=-18.05\\pm0.37$). They lie far below the UV luminosity-stellar mass\nrelation for Lyman break galaxies and are about $\\sim100\\times$ fainter at the\nsame mass. The massive galaxies are red ($R-Ks_{AB}=3.9\\pm0.2$; restframe\nUV-slope $\\beta=-0.2\\pm0.3$) likely from dust or old stellar ages. We classify\nthe galaxy SEDs by their restframe $U-V$ and $V-J$ colors and find a diverse\npopulation: $46^{+6+10}_{-6-17}$% of the massive galaxies are quiescent,\n$54^{+8+17}_{-8-10}$% are dusty star-forming galaxies, and only\n$14^{+3+10}_{-3-4}$% resemble luminous blue star forming Lyman break galaxies.\nThis study clearly demonstrates an inherent diversity among massive galaxies at\nhigher redshift than previously known. Furthermore,we uncover a reservoir of\ndusty star-forming galaxies with $4\\times$ lower specific star-formation rates\ncompared to submillimeter-selected starbursts at $z>3$. With $5\\times$ higher\nnumbers, the dusty galaxies may represent a more typical mode of star formation\ncompared to submillimeter-bright starbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 20:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-26"}

We use state-of-the-art\nadaptive mesh refinement cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of a 21x24x20\n(Mpc/h)$^3$ region centered on a cluster to examine the SFR-density and\ncolor-density relations of galaxies at z=0 and z=1. The local environmental\ndensity is defined by the dark matter mass in spheres of radius 1 Mpc/h, and we\nprobe two decades of environmental densities. Our simulations produce a large\nincrease of SFR with density at z=1, as in the observations of Elbaz et al. We\nalso find a significant evolution to z=0, where the SFR-density relation is\nmuch flatter. The color-density relation in our simulations is consistent from\nz=1 to z=0, in agreement with observations. We find that the increase in the\nmedian SFR with local density at z=1 is due to a growing population of\nstar-forming galaxies in higher-density environments. At z=0 and z=1 both the\nSFR and cold gas mass are tightly correlated with the galaxy halo mass, and\ntherefore the correlation between median halo mass and local density is an\nimportant cause of the SFR-density relation at both redshifts. We also show\nthat the local density on 1 Mpc/h scales affects galaxy SFRs as much as halo\nmass at z=0. Finally, we find indications that the role of the 1 Mpc/h scale\nenvironment reverses from z=0 to z=1: at z=0 high-density environments depress\ngalaxy SFRs, while at z=1 high-density environments tend to increase SFRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 20:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We\nintroduce the method of a linear search grid to analyse GRB events with large\nsky localisation uncertainties such as the localisations provided by the Fermi\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). Coherent searches for gravitational waves (GWs)\ncan be computationally intensive when the GRB sky position is not\nwell-localised, due to the corrections required for the difference in arrival\ntime between detectors. Using a linear search grid we are able to reduce the\ncomputational cost of the analysis by a factor of O(10) for GBM events.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that our analysis pipeline can improve upon the sky\nlocalisation of GRBs detected by the GBM, if a high-frequency GW signal is\nobserved in coincidence. We use the linear search grid method in a search for\nGWs associated with 129 GRBs observed satellite-based gamma-ray experiments\nbetween 2006 and 2011. The GRBs in our sample had not been previously analysed\nfor GW counterparts. A fraction of our GRB events are analysed using data from\nGEO600 while the detector was using squeezed-light states to improve its\nsensitivity; this is the first search for GWs using data from a squeezed-light\ninterferometric observatory. We find no evidence for GW signals, either with\nany individual GRB in this sample or with the population as a whole. For each\nGRB we place lower bounds on the distance to the progenitor, assuming a fixed\nGW emission energy of $10^{-2} M_{\\odot}c^{2}$, with a median exclusion\ndistance of 0.8 Mpc for emission at 500 Hz and 0.3 Mpc at 1 kHz. The reduced\ncomputational cost associated with a linear search grid will enable rapid\nsearches for GWs associated with Fermi GBM events in the Advanced detector era.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 20:07:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 19:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

We assume that the relay station is\nequipped with massive arrays, while all sources and destinations have a single\nantenna. The relay station uses channel estimates obtained from received pilots\nand zero-forcing (ZF) or maximum-ratio combining/maximum-ratio transmission\n(MRC/MRT) to process the signals. To reduce significantly the loop interference\neffect, we propose two techniques: i) using a massive receive antenna array; or\nii) using a massive transmit antenna array together with very low transmit\npower at the relay station. We derive an exact achievable rate in closed-form\nfor MRC/MRT processing and an analytical approximation of the achievable rate\nfor ZF processing. This approximation is very tight, especially for large\nnumber of relay station antennas. These closed-form expressions enable us to\ndetermine the regions where the full-duplex mode outperforms the half-duplex\nmode, as well as, to design an optimal power allocation scheme. This optimal\npower allocation scheme aims to maximize the energy efficiency for a given sum\nspectral efficiency and under peak power constraints at the relay station and\nsources. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the optimal power\nallocation scheme. Furthermore, we show that, by doubling the number of\ntransmit/receive antennas at the relay station, the transmit power of each\nsource and of the relay station can be reduced by 1.5dB if the pilot power is\nequal to the signal power, and by 3dB if the pilot power is kept fixed, while\nmaintaining a given quality-of-service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 20:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-07"}

We enable this new functionality of magnetic tunnel junctions by\ncombining a thermal gradient and an electric field. This new technique unveils\nthe bias-enhanced tunnel magneto-Seebeck effect, which can serve as the basis\nfor logic devices or memories in a green information technology with a pure\nthermal write and read process. Furthermore, the thermally generated voltages\nthat are referred to as the Seebeck effect are well known to sensitively depend\non the electronic structure and therefore have been valued in solid-state\nphysics for nearly one hundred years. Here, we lift Seebeck's historic\ndiscovery from 1821 to a new level of current spintronics. Our results show\nthat the signal crosses zero and can be adjusted by tuning a bias voltage that\nis applied between the electrodes of the junction; hence, the name of the\neffect is bias-enhanced tunnel magneto-Seebeck effect (bTMS). Via the spin- and\nenergy-dependent transmission of electrons in the junction, the bTMS effect can\nbe configured using the bias voltage with much higher control than the tunnel\nmagnetoresistance (TMR) and even completely suppressed for only one magnetic\nconfiguration, which is either parallel (P) or anti-parallel (AP). This option\nallows a readout contrast for the magnetic information of -3000% at room\ntemperature while maintaining a large signal for one magnetic orientation. This\ncontrast is much larger than the value that can be obtained using the TMR\neffect. Moreover, our measurements are a step towards the experimental\nrealization of high TMS ratios, which are predicted for specific Co-Fe\ncompositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 20:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-24"}

During this\nperiod, an elevated level of the M87 flux is reported at VHE gamma rays. We\ndetected a remarkable increase of the radio flux density from the unresolved\njet base (radio core) with VERA at 22 and 43GHz coincident with the VHE\nactivity. Meanwhile, we confirmed with EVN at 5GHz that HST-1 (an alternative\ngamma-ray production candidate site) remained quiescent in terms of its flux\ndensity and structure. These results in the radio bands strongly suggest that\nthe VHE gamma-ray activity in 2012 originates in the jet base within 0.03pc or\n56 Schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black hole. We further\nconducted VERA astrometry for the M87 core during the flaring period, and\ndetected core shifts between 22 and 43GHz.

This work is part of a long-term spectroscopic study of a sample of\n30 multiple stars with early-type components. In this second paper we present\nthe results of six multiple systems in which new stellar components have been\ndetected.\n  Aims. The main aim is to increase the knowledge of stellar properties and\ndynamical structure of early-type multiple stellar systems.\n  Methods. Using spectroscopic observations taken over a time baseline of more\nthan 5 years we measured RVs by cross-correlations and applied a spectral\ndisentangling method to double-lined systems. Besides the discovery of objects\nwith double-lined spectra, the existence of new spectroscopic subsystems have\nbeen inferred from the radial velocity variations of single-lined components\nand through the variation of the barycentric velocity of double-lined\nsubsystems. Orbital elements have been calculated when possible.\n  Results. Seven new stellar components and two members that we expect to\nconfirm with new observations have been discovered in the six studied\nmultiples. We present orbital parameters for two double-lined binaries and\npreliminary orbits for three single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Five of the\nsix analysed systems are quadruples, while the remaining has five components\ndistributed in four hierarchical levels. These multiplicity orders are in fact\nlower limits, since these systems lack high-resolution visual observations and\nadditional hierarchical level might exist in that separation range.\n  Conclusions. The six analysed systems have greater multiplicity degree and a\nmore complex hierarchical structure than previously known, which suggests that\nhigh-order multiple systems are significantly more frequent that it is\ncurrently estimated. The long term spectroscopic monitoring of multiple systems\nhas shown to be useful for the detection of companions in intermediate\nhierarchical levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 21:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

For the linear deterministic IC-OR that models the\nGaussian noise channel at high SNR, non i.i.d. Bernoulli(1/2) input bits are\nshown to achieve points not achievable by i.i.d. Bernoulli(1/2) input bits used\nin the same achievability scheme. For the real-valued Gaussian IC-OR the gap is\nshown to be at most 1/2 bit per channel use, even though the set of optimal\ninput distributions for the derived outer bound could not be determined.\nTowards understanding the Gaussian IC-OR, an achievability strategy is\nevaluated in which the input alphabets at the non-oblivious transmitter are a\nmixture of discrete and Gaussian random variables, where the cardinality of the\ndiscrete part is appropriately chosen as a function of the channel parameters.\nSurprisingly, as the oblivious receiver intuitively should not be able to\n'jointly decode' the intended and interfering messages (whose codebook is\nunavailable), it is shown that with this choice of input, the capacity region\nof the symmetric Gaussian IC-OR is to within 3.34 bits (per channel use per\nuser) of an outer bound for the classical Gaussian IC with full codebook\nknowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2014 00:54:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 15:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-03"}

On the other hand, Ethernet speed extends to\n40Gbps and 100Gbps recently, and even 400Gbps in the near future. The\nultra-high speed requires congestion control algorithms to adapt to the broad\nchanges of bandwidth, and highlights the impacts of small delay by enlarging\nthe bandwidth delay product. The state-of-art standard QCN is heuristically\ndesigned for the 1Gbps and 10Gbps Ethernet, and unaware of the challenges\naccompanying the ultra-high speed.\n  To scale congestion control to ultra-high speed Ethernet, we propose the\nAdaptive Sliding Mode (ASM) congestion control algorithm, which is simple,\nstable, has fast and smooth convergence process, can tolerate the impacts of\ndelay and adapt to the wide changes of bandwidth.

In this paper, we study the\ncurvature properties for a large sample of Fermi/LAT bright blazars based on\nquasi-simultaneous SED. Both SEDs of synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC)\ncomponents are fitted by a log-parabolic law in log_v-log_vfv diagram. The\nsecond-degree term of log-parabola measures the curvature of SED. We find a\nstatistically significant correlation between synchrotron peak frequency and\nits curvature. This result is in agreement with the theoretical prediction, and\nconfirms previous studies, which dealt with single source with various epoch\nobservations or a small sample. If a broken power-law is employed to fit the\nSED, the difference between the two spectral indexes (alpha2-alpha1) can be\nconsidered as a \"surrogate\" of the SED curvature. We collect spectral\nparameters of a sample blazars from literature, and find a correlation between\nthe synchrotron peak frequency and the spectral difference. We do not find a\nsignificant correlation between the IC peak frequency and its curvature, which\nmay be caused by complicated seed photon field. It is also found that the\nsynchrotron curvatures are on average larger than that of IC curvatures, and\nthere is no correlation between these two parameters. As suggested by previous\nworks in literature, both the log-parabolic law of SED and above correlation\ncan be explained by statistical and/or stochastic particle accelerations.\nStochastic particle acceleration predicts a different slope of the correlation\nfrom that of statistical one, and our result seems favor stochastic\nacceleration mechanisms and emission processes. Some of other evidences also\nseem to support that the electron energy distribution (and/or synchrotron SED)\nmay be log-parabolic, which include SED modeling, particle acceleration\nsimulation, and comparisons between some predictions and empirical\nrelations/correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2014 03:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The HCM was an orthorhombic\nbiaxial material if the symmetry axes of the two populations of spheroids were\nmutually perpendicular and a uniaxial material if these two axes were mutually\naligned. The degree of anisotropy of the HCM, as gauged by the ratio of the\neigenvalues of the HCM's permittivity dyadic, increased as the shape of the\nconstituent particles became more eccentric.

To\nmake use of this low-rank structural information, this paper presents a\ntwo-dimensional image matrix based error model, i.e. matrix regression, for\nface representation and classification. Our model uses the minimal nuclear norm\nof representation error image as a criterion, and the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers method to calculate the regression coefficients. Compared\nwith the current regression methods, the proposed Nuclear Norm based Matrix\nRegression (NMR) model is more robust for alleviating the effect of\nillumination, and more intuitive and powerful for removing the structural noise\ncaused by occlusion. We experiment using four popular face image databases, the\nExtended Yale B database, the AR database, the Multi-PIE and the FRGC database.\nExperimental results demonstrate the performance advantage of NMR over the\nstate-of-the-art regression based face recognition methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2014 09:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-07"}

The underlying\nmatrix product state (MPS) ansatz is a low-rank decomposition of the full\nconfiguration interaction tensor. The virtual dimension of the MPS controls the\nsize of the corner of the many-body Hilbert space that can be reached.\n  Whereas the MPS ansatz will only yield an efficient description for\nnoncritical one-dimensional systems, it can still be used as a variational\nansatz for other finite-size systems. Rather large virtual dimensions are then\nrequired. The two most important aspects to reduce the corresponding\ncomputational cost are a proper choice and ordering of the active space\norbitals, and the exploitation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian. By\ntaking care of both aspects, DMRG becomes an efficient replacement for exact\ndiagonalization in quantum chemistry.\n  DMRG and Hartree-Fock theory have an analogous structure. The former can be\ninterpreted as a self-consistent mean-field theory in the DMRG lattice sites,\nand the latter in the particles. It is possible to build upon this analogy to\nintroduce post-DMRG methods. Based on an approximate MPS, these methods provide\nimproved ans\\\"atze for the ground state, as well as for excitations.\nExponentiation of the single-particle (single-site) excitations for a Slater\ndeterminant (an MPS with open boundary conditions) leads to the Thouless\ntheorem for Hartree-Fock theory (DMRG), an explicit nonredundant\nparameterization of the entire manifold of Slater determinants (MPS\nwavefunctions). This gives rise to the configuration interaction expansion for\nDMRG. The Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation lies at the basis of auxiliary\nfield quantum Monte Carlo for Slater determinants. An analogous transformation\nfor spin-lattice Hamiltonians allows to formulate a promising variant for MPSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2014 11:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-22"}

We\nexplicitly show that the thermal contribution to the helium abundance at T = m\nof a cooling universe 0.045 % is higher than the corresponding contribution to\nhelium abundance of a heating universe 0.031% due to the existence of hot\nfermions before the beginning of nucleosynthesis and their absence after the\nnucleosynthesis, in the early universe. Thermal contribution to helium\nabundance was a simple quadratic function of temperature, before and after the\nnucleosynthesis. However, this quadratic behavior was not the same before the\ndecoupling temperature due to weak interactions; so the nucleosynthesis did not\neven start before the universe had cooled down to the neutrino decoupling\ntemperatures and QED became a dominant theory. It is also explicitly shown that\nthe chemical potential in the core of supermassive and superdense stars affect\nbeta decay and their helium abundance but the background contributions depend\non the ratio between temperature and chemical potential and not the chemical\npotential or temperature only.

The local deviation from the 2H\nstacking of the wurtzite matrix to a 3C zinc-blende stacking induces a bound\nstate in the gap of the host crystal, resulting in the localization of\nexcitons. Due to the two-dimensional nature of these planar defects, stacking\nfaults act as quantum wells, giving rise to radiative transitions of excitons\nwith characteristic energies.

In particular, in \\cite{DKBB} the possibility to\nuse of the projection postulate and representation of \"mental observables\" by\nHermitian operators was discussed in very detail. The main conclusion of the\nrecent discussions on the foundations of \"quantum(-like) cognitive psychology\"\nis that one has to be careful in determination of conditions of applicability\nof the projection postulate as a mathematical tool for description of\nmeasurements of observables represented by Hermitian operators. To represent\nsome statistical experimental data (both physical and mental) in the\nquantum(-like) way, one has to use generalized quantum observables given by\npositive operator-valued measures (POVMs). This paper contains a brief review\non POVMs which can be useful for newcomers to the field of quantum(-like)\nstudies. Especially interesting for cognitive psychology is a variant of the\nformula of total probability (FTP) with the interference term derived for\nincompatible observables given by POVMs. We present an interpretation of the\ninterference term from the psychological viewpoint. As was shown before, the\nappearance of such a term (perturbing classical FTP) plays the important role\nin cognitive psychology, e.g., recognition of ambiguous figures and the\ndisjunction effect. The interference term for observables given by POVMs has\nmuch more complicated structure than the corresponding term for observables\ngiven by Hermitian operators. We elaborate cognitive interpretations of\ndifferent components of the POVMs-interference term and apply our analysis to a\nquantum(-like) model of decision making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2014 13:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

Typically, the MTD is identified using a dose-escalation\nstudy, where initial subjects are treated at the lowest dose level and\nsubsequent subjects are treated at progressively higher dose levels until the\nMTD is identified. The continual reassessment method (CRM) is a popular\nmodel-based dose-escalation design, which utilizes a formal model for the\nrelationship between dose and toxicity to guide dose-finding. Recently, it was\nshown that the CRM has a tendency to get \"stuck\" on a dose-level, with little\nescalation or de-escalation in the late stages of the trial, due to the\nlong-memory property of the CRM. We propose the randomized CRM (rCRM), which\nintroduces random escalation and de-escalation into the standard CRM\ndose-finding algorithm, as an approach to overcoming the long-memory property\nof the CRM.

Adiabatic\nphoton production (or destruction) or deviations from isotropy and homogeneity\ncould modify this scaling and several observational tests have been carried out\nin response. Here, we explain why `adiabatic' conditions are extremely\ndifficult to establish in the redshift range targeted by these tests. Thus,\ninstead of leading to a simple rescaling of the CMB temperature, a spectral\ndistortion should be produced, which can be constrained using COBE/FIRAS. For\nscenarios with late photon production, tests of the temperature-redshift\nrelation (TRR) should therefore be reinterpreted as weak spectral distortion\nlimits, directly probing the energy dependence of the photon production\nprocess. For inhomogeneous cosmologies, an average y-type distortion is\nproduced, but this type of distortion can be created in several other ways.\nHere, we briefly discuss possible effects that may help disentangling different\ncontributions to the distortion signal, finding this to be very challenging.

Firstly, many approaches lack the\nability to weight the base clusterings without access to the original data and\ncan be affected significantly by the low-quality, or even ill clusterings.\nSecondly, they generally focus on the instance level or cluster level in the\nensemble system and fail to integrate multi-granularity cues into a unified\nmodel.

Instability caused\nby a gradient in either the ion-temperature profile or by shear in the parallel\nflow has been discussed extensively in the literature. In this paper,\nhydrodynamic plasma stability is investigated, real and imaginary frequency are\nquantified over a range of the shear parameter, the normalized wavenumber, and\nthe ratio of density-gradient and ion-temperature-gradient scale lengths, and\nthe role of inverse Landau damping is illustrated for the case of combined\nion-temperature gradient and parallel-flow shear. We find that increasing the\nion-temperature gradient reduces the instability threshold for the hydrodynamic\nparallel-flow shear instability, also known as the parallel Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability or the D'Angelo instability. We also find that a kinetic\ninstability arises from the coupled, reinforcing action of both free-energy\nsources. For the case of comparable electron and ion temperature, we illustrate\nanalytically the transition of the D'Angelo instability to the kinetic\ninstability as the shear parameter, the normalized wavenumber, and the ratio of\ndensity-gradient and ion-temperature-gradient scale lengths are varied and we\nattribute the changes in stability to changes in the amount of inverse ion\nLandau damping. We show that, near a normalized wavenumber $k_{\\perp} \\rho_{i}$\nof order unity, the real and imaginary values of frequency become comparable\nand the growth rate maximizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2014 15:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

PD is due to the\nloss of dopamine-producing brain cells, and symptoms only worsen over time,\nmaking early detection and diagnosis of the disease key to effective management\nand treatment. There is currently no standardized method of diagnosis\navailable, and instead a combination of the medical history of a patient and\nphysician judgment is used. In this research, a novel method of accurately\ndiagnosing PD using an artificial neural network (ANN) and speech measurements\nwas developed. Using this technology, a patient need only speak into a computer\nmicrophone. Speech data is then analyzed using Praat and inputted into the ANN\nto obtain the diagnosis. The ANN, built using MATLAB and trained and tested\nwith actual patient data, was able to correctly classify 96.55% of test data. A\nmathematical model of the GPe/STN neural cluster was then constructed to\naccount for Parkinsonian tremor. This was done using a two-cell model that\ncoupled a GPe neuron to a STN neuron and consisted of a system of twelve\nordinary differential equations. The model was structured to account for neuron\nbursting behavior, neurotransmitter release, and synaptic connections between\nneurons. After comparison to the biological behavior of the cluster and neuron\nfiring patterns in PD patients, the model was determined to be predictive of\nknown biological results. This work presents a significant step forward in PD\nresearch and could be successfully implemented into clinical practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2014 15:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-07"}

Time series spectroscopy from a few days after\nmaximum light to 100 days later shows them to be fairly typical of this class,\nwith spectra dominated by Ca II, Mg II, Fe II and Si II, which evolve slowly\nover most of the post-peak photospheric phase. We determine bolometric light\ncurves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy input\nby magnetar spin-down, 56Ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaque\ncircumstellar shell. We investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of our\nsample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain the\npossible mechanisms behind these events. We have followed these events to\nbeyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fading\nsupernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diverse\nbehaviour at this phase. Models powered by radioactivity require unrealistic\nparameters to reproduce the observed light curves, as found by previous\nstudies. Both magnetar heating and circumstellar interaction still appear to be\nviable candidates. A large diversity is emerging in observed tail-phase\nluminosities, with magnetar models failing in some cases to predict the rapid\ndrop in flux.
