Earlier,\nit has been observed that in a significant part of the energy and angular\nmomentum parameter space, rotating transonic accretion flow undergoes shock\ntransition before entering in to the black hole and a part of the post-shock\nmatter is ejected as bipolar outflows, which are supposed to be the precursor\nof relativistic jets. In this work, we simulate accretion flows having\ninjection parameters from the inviscid shock parameter space, and study the\nresponse of viscosity on them. With the increase of viscosity, shock becomes\ntime dependent and starts to oscillate when the viscosity parameter crosses its\ncritical value. As a result, the in falling matter inside the post-shock region\nexhibits quasi-periodic variations and causes periodic ejection of matter from\nthe inner disc as outflows. In addition, the same hot and dense post-shock\nmatter emits high energy radiation and the emanating photon flux also modulates\nquasi-periodically. Assuming a ten solar mass black hole, the corresponding\npower density spectrum peaks at the fundamental frequency of few Hz followed by\nmultiple harmonics. This feature is very common in several outbursting black\nhole candidates. We discuss the implications of such periodic variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 May 2014 16:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}

The push\nrecovery capability grows with age (a child has poor push recovery than an\nadult) and it is based on learning. A wrestler, for example, has better push\nrecovery than an ordinary man. However, the mechanism of reactive push recovery\nis not known to us. We tried to understand the human learning mechanism by\nconducting several experiments. The subjects for the experiments were selected\nboth as right handed and left handed. Pushes were induced from the behind with\nclose eyes to observe the motor action as well as with open eyes to observe\nlearning based reactive behaviors. Important observations show that the left\nhanded and right handed persons negotiate pushes differently (in opposite\nmanner). The present research describes some details about the experiments and\nthe analyses of the results mainly obtained from the joint angle variations\n(both for ankle and hip joints) as the manifestation of perturbation.

The result has implications for the compressibility\nand kernelizability of a whole range of NP-complete parameterized problems. We\npresent a streamlined proof of Drucker's theorem.\n  An AND-compression is a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that maps a\nset of SAT-instances $x_1,\\dots,x_t$ to a single SAT-instance $y$ of size\npoly(max $|x_i|$) such that $y$ is satisfiable if and only if all $x_i$ are\nsatisfiable.

With a\nvariation of the modeling scales, theoretically there should have a continuous\nspectrum of fluid dynamic equations. In order to study multiscale flow\nevolution efficiently, the dynamics in the computational fluid has to be\nchanged with the scales. A direct modeling of flow physics with a changeable\nscale may become an appropriate approach. The unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS)\nis a direct modeling method in the mesh size scale, and its underlying flow\nphysics depends on the resolution of the cell size relative to the particle\nmean free path. The cell size of UGKS is not limited by the particle mean free\npath. With the variation of the ratio between the numerical cell size and local\nparticle mean free path, the UGKS recovers the flow dynamics from the particle\ntransport and collision in the kinetic scale to the wave propagation in the\nhydrodynamic scale.\n  The previous UGKS is mostly constructed from the evolution solution of\nkinetic model equations. This work is about the further development of the UGKS\nwith the implementation of the full Boltzmann collision term in the region\nwhere it is needed. The central ingredient of the UGKS is the coupled treatment\nof particle transport and collision in the flux evaluation across a cell\ninterface, where a continuous flow dynamics from kinetic to hydrodynamic scales\nis modeled. The newly developed UGKS has the asymptotic preserving (AP)\nproperty of recovering the NS solutions in the continuum flow regime, and the\nfull Boltzmann solution in the rarefied regime. In the mostly unexplored\ntransition regime, the UGKS itself provides a valuable tool for the flow study\nin this regime. The mathematical properties of the scheme, such as stability,\naccuracy, and the asymptotic preserving, will be analyzed in this paper as\nwell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 May 2014 09:38:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2016 15:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-21"}

In order to grasp the essence\nof this phenomenon, it is fundamental to understand how different\nmanifestations of entanglement relate to each other. In 1999, Peres conjectured\nthat Bell nonlocality is equivalent to distillability of entanglement. The\nintuition of Peres was that the non-classicality of an entangled state, as\nwitnessed via Bell inequality violation, implies that pure entanglement can be\ndistilled from this state, hence making it useful for most quantum information\nprotocols. Subsequently, the Peres conjecture was shown to hold true in several\nspecific cases, and became a central open question in quantum information\ntheory. Here we disprove the Peres conjecture by showing that an undistillable\nbipartite entangled state---a bound entangled state---can nevertheless violate\na Bell inequality. This shows that Bell nonlocality implies neither\nentanglement distillability, nor non-positivity under partial transposition,\nthus clarifying the relation between three fundamental aspects of entanglement.\nFinally, our results lead to a novel application of bound entanglement for\ndevice-independent randomness certification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 May 2014 13:30:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Nov 2014 08:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

Bag of Visual Words model (BoVW) with\nlocal features has become the most popular method and obtained the\nstate-of-the-art performance on several realistic datasets, such as the HMDB51,\nUCF50, and UCF101. BoVW is a general pipeline to construct a global\nrepresentation from a set of local features, which is mainly composed of five\nsteps: (i) feature extraction, (ii) feature pre-processing, (iii) codebook\ngeneration, (iv) feature encoding, and (v) pooling and normalization. Many\nefforts have been made in each step independently in different scenarios and\ntheir effect on action recognition is still unknown. Meanwhile, video data\nexhibits different views of visual pattern, such as static appearance and\nmotion dynamics. Multiple descriptors are usually extracted to represent these\ndifferent views. Many feature fusion methods have been developed in other areas\nand their influence on action recognition has never been investigated before.\nThis paper aims to provide a comprehensive study of all steps in BoVW and\ndifferent fusion methods, and uncover some good practice to produce a\nstate-of-the-art action recognition system. Specifically, we explore two kinds\nof local features, ten kinds of encoding methods, eight kinds of pooling and\nnormalization strategies, and three kinds of fusion methods. We conclude that\nevery step is crucial for contributing to the final recognition rate.\nFurthermore, based on our comprehensive study, we propose a simple yet\neffective representation, called hybrid representation, by exploring the\ncomplementarity of different BoVW frameworks and local descriptors.

This\ntransition is accompanied by an energy release of $115.6$GHz. We constructed an\nexperimental setup to measure whether this energy is released in the form of\nthermal or electromagnetic energy. Contrary to a previous publication we find\nno evidence for release of electromagnetic radiation. Our results for\ntransitions between the first and second excited states to the ground state are\nconsistent with a release of only thermal energy. This energy release extends\nfor a longer time for the second excited state than for the first excited\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 May 2014 14:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-02"}

This formalism extends upon a previously developed\nperturbative technique for a linear vibronic coupling Hamiltonian. The\nadvantage of the quadratic model Hamiltonian is that it allows one to use\nseparate quadratic representations for potential energy surfaces of different\nelectronic states and a more flexible representation of interstate couplings.\nWe explore features introduced by the quadratic Hamiltonian in a series of 2D\nmodels, and then apply our formalism to the 2,6-bis(methylene) adamantyl\ncation, and its dimethyl derivative. The Hamiltonian parameters for the\nmolecular systems have been obtained from electronic structure calculations\nfollowed by a diabatization procedure. The evolution of electronic populations\nin the molecular systems using the perturbative formalism shows a good\nagreement with that from variational quantum dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 May 2014 15:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-12"}

The Vista Variables in the V\\'ia L\\'actea (VVV) ESO Public Survey is\na variability survey of the Milky Way bulge and an adjacent section of the disk\ncarried out from 2010 on ESO Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for\nAstronomy (VISTA). VVV will eventually deliver a deep near-IR atlas with\nphotometry and positions in five passbands (ZYJHK_S) and a catalogue of 1-10\nmillion variable point sources - mostly unknown - which require\nclassifications. Aims. The main goal of the VVV Templates Project, that we\nintroduce in this work, is to develop and test the machine-learning algorithms\nfor the automated classification of the VVV light-curves. As VVV is the first\nmassive, multi-epoch survey of stellar variability in the near-infrared, the\ntemplate light-curves that are required for training the classification\nalgorithms are not available. In the first paper of the series we describe the\nconstruction of this comprehensive database of infrared stellar variability.\nMethods. First we performed a systematic search in the literature and public\ndata archives, second, we coordinated a worldwide observational campaign, and\nthird we exploited the VVV variability database itself on (optically)\nwell-known stars to gather high-quality infrared light-curves of several\nhundreds of variable stars. Results. We have now collected a significant (and\nstill increasing) number of infrared template light-curves. This database will\nbe used as a training-set for the machine-learning algorithms that will\nautomatically classify the light-curves produced by VVV. The results of such an\nautomated classification will be covered in forthcoming papers of the series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 May 2014 15:08:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 03:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}
