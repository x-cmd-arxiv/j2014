We show that sluggish lid convection, an intermediate\nregime between the isoviscous and stagnant lid regimes, can create the heat\nflow and deformation rates appropriate for ridge and trough formation on a\nnumber of satellites, regardless of the ice shell thickness. For convection to\ndeform their surfaces, the ice shells must have yield stresses similar in\nmagnitude to the daily tidal stresses.

In the context of turbulent flows, many non trivial phenomena\nsuch as small scales particles clustering or preferential spatial accumulation\nhave been explained and understood. A more complete view of multiphase flows\ncan be gained calling into play two-way coupling effects, i.e. by accounting\nfor the inter-phase momentum exchange between the carrier and the suspended\nphase, certainly relevant at increasing mass loading. In such regime, partially\ninvestigated in the past by the so-called Particle In Cell (PIC) method, much\nis still to be learned about the dynamics of the disperse phase and the ensuing\nalteration of the carrier flow.\n  In this paper we present a new methodology rigorously designed to capture the\ninter-phase momentum exchange for particles smaller than the smallest\nhydrodynamical scale, e.g. the Kolmogorov scale in a turbulent flow. In fact,\nthe momentum coupling mechanism exploits the unsteady Stokes flow around a\nsmall rigid sphere where the transient disturbance produced by each particle is\nevaluated in a closed form. The particles are described as lumped, point masses\nwhich would lead to the appearance of singularities. A rigorous regularization\nprocedure is conceived to extract the physically relevant interactions between\nparticles and fluid which avoids any \"ah hoc\" assumption. The approach is\nsuited for high efficiency implementation on massively parallel machines since\nthe transient disturbance produced by the particles is strongly localized in\nspace around the actual particle position. As will be shown, hundred thousands\nparticles can therefore be handled at an affordable computational cost as\ndemonstrated by a preliminary application to a particle laden turbulent shear\nflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2014 16:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-28"}

The fundamental\nexample is the category whose objects are Euclidean spaces and whose arrows are\nsmooth maps.\n  Tensor differential categories provide the framework for categorical models\nof differential linear logic. The coKleisli category of any tensor differential\ncategory is always a Cartesian differential category. Cartesian differential\ncategories, besides arising in this manner as coKleisli categories, occur in\nmany different and quite independent ways. Thus, it was not obvious how to pass\nfrom Cartesian differential categories back to tensor differential categories.\n  This paper provides natural conditions under which the linear maps of a\nCartesian differential category form a tensor differential category. This is a\nquestion of some practical importance as much of the machinery of modern\ndifferential geometry is based on models which implicitly allow such a passage,\nand thus the results and tools of the area tend to freely assume access to this\nstructure.\n  The purpose of this paper is to make precise the connection between the two\ntypes of differential categories. As a prelude to this, however, it is\nconvenient to have available a general theory which relates the behaviour of\n\"linear\" maps in Cartesian categories to the structure of Seely categories. The\nlatter were developed to provide the categorical semantics for (fragments of)\nlinear logic which use a \"storage\" modality.

In March 2008, photometric and spectroscopic observations of\nV354 Mon were obtained simultaneously with the CoRoT satellite, the 60 cm\ntelescope at the Observat\\'orio Pico dos Dias (LNA - Brazil) equipped with a\nCCD camera and Johnson/Cousins BVRI filters, and the SOPHIE \\'echelle\nspectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (CNRS - France). The light\ncurve of V354 Mon shows periodical minima (P = 5.26 +/- 0.50 days) that vary in\ndepth and width at each rotational cycle. From the analysis of the photometric\nand spectroscopic data, it is possible to identify correlations between the\nemission line variability and the light-curve modulation of the young system,\nsuch as the occurrence of pronounced redshifted absorption in the H_alpha line\nat the epoch of minimum flux. This is evidence that during photometric minima\nwe see the accretion funnel projected onto the stellar photosphere in our line\nof sight, implying that the hot spot coincides with the light-curve minima. We\napplied models of cold and hot spots and a model of occultation by\ncircumstellar material to investigate the source of the observed photometric\nvariations.

Combined with previous data around the so-called 1/8 doping, we\nshow that bulk CDW order exists at least for hole concentrations (p) in the\nCuO2 planes of 0.078 <~ p <~ 0.132. This implies that CDW order exists in close\nvicinity to the quantum critical point for spin density wave (SDW) order. In\ncontrast to the pseudogap temperature T*, the onset temperature of CDW order\ndecreases with underdoping to T_CDW ~ 90K in YBa2Cu3O6.44. Together with a\nweakened order parameter this suggests a competition between CDW and SDW\norders. In addition, the CDW order in YBa2Cu3O6.44 shows the same type of\ncompetition with superconductivity as a function of temperature and magnetic\nfield as samples closer to p = 1/8. At low p the CDW incommensurability\ncontinues the previously reported linear increasing trend with underdoping.

These advantages allow measurements of absolute\nchiral signals in environments where background subtractions are not feasible:\nwe measure optical rotation from chiral vapour in open air, and from chiral\nliquids in the evanescent wave (EW) produced by total internal reflection at a\nprism surface.

To\naddress these issues, we need a theory of consciousness that specifies what\nexperience is and what type of physical systems can have it. Integrated\nInformation Theory (IIT) does so by starting from conscious experience via five\nphenomenological axioms of existence, composition, information, integration,\nand exclusion. From these it derives five postulates about the properties\nrequired of physical mechanisms to support consciousness. The theory provides a\nprincipled account of both the quantity and the quality of an individual\nexperience, and a calculus to evaluate whether or not a particular system of\nmechanisms is conscious and of what. IIT explains a range of clinical and\nlaboratory findings, makes testable predictions, and extrapolates to unusual\nconditions. The theory vindicates some panpsychist intuitions - consciousness\nis an intrinsic, fundamental property, is graded, is common among biological\norganisms, and even some very simple systems have some. However, unlike\npanpsychism, IIT implies that not everything is conscious, for example group of\nindividuals or feed forward networks. In sharp contrast with widespread\nfunctionalist beliefs, IIT implies that digital computers, even if their\nbehavior were to be functionally equivalent to ours, and even if they were to\nrun faithful simulations of the human brain, would experience next to nothing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 May 2014 23:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-29"}

An individual's threshold indicates the minimum\nlevel of influence that must be exerted, by other members of the population\nengaged in some activity, before the individual will join the activity. In this\nwork, we begin with a homogeneous version of the Linear Threshold model\nproposed by Kempe et al. in the context of viral marketing, and generalize this\nmodel to arbitrary threshold distributions. We show that the evolution can be\nmodeled as a discrete time Markov chain, and, by using a certain scaling, we\nobtain a fluid limit that provides an ordinary differential equation model\n(o.d.e.). We find that the threshold distribution appears in the o.d.e. via its\nhazard rate function. We demonstrate the accuracy of the o.d.e. approximation\nand derive explicit expressions for the trajectory of influence under the\nuniform threshold distribution. Also, for an exponentially distributed\nthreshold, we show that the fluid dynamics are equivalent to the well-known SIR\nmodel in epidemiology. We also numerically study how other hazard functions\n(obtained from the Weibull and loglogistic distributions) provide qualitative\ndifferent characteristics of the influence evolution, compared to traditional\nepidemic models, even in a homogeneous setting.

Two metrics are\ncommonly used for evaluating the estimators: i) variance; ii) a high\nprobability multiplicative-approximation guarantee.

Intuitively, two nodes belong to the same role if they are\nstructurally similar. Roles have been mainly of interest to sociologists, but\nmore recently, roles have become increasingly useful in other domains.\nTraditionally, the notion of roles were defined based on graph equivalences\nsuch as structural, regular, and stochastic equivalences. We briefly revisit\nthese early notions and instead propose a more general formulation of roles\nbased on the similarity of a feature representation (in contrast to the graph\nrepresentation). This leads us to propose a taxonomy of three general classes\nof techniques for discovering roles that includes (i) graph-based roles, (ii)\nfeature-based roles, and (iii) hybrid roles. We also propose a flexible\nframework for discovering roles using the notion of similarity on a\nfeature-based representation. The framework consists of two fundamental\ncomponents: (a) role feature construction and (b) role assignment using the\nlearned feature representation. We discuss the different possibilities for\ndiscovering feature-based roles and the tradeoffs of the many techniques for\ncomputing them. Finally, we discuss potential applications and future\ndirections and challenges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 06:59:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 00:47:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 22:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-07"}

Using archival data from observations with the\nXMM-Newton and the Swift observatories spanning over ~10 yr, we show that WR 25\nis a periodic variable in X-rays with a period of $208 \\pm 3$ days. X-ray light\ncurves in the 0.5-10.0 keV energy band show phase-locked variability, where the\nflux increased by a factor of ~2 from minimum to maximum, being maximum near\nperiastron passage. The light curve in the soft energy band (0.5-2.0 keV) shows\ntwo minima indicating the presence of two eclipses. However, the light curve in\nthe hard energy band (2.0-10.0 keV) shows only one minimum during the apastron\npassage. The X-ray spectra of WR 25 were explained by a two-temperature plasma\nmodel. Both the cool and the hot plasmas were constant at 0.628+/-0.008 and\n2.75+/-0.06 keV throughout an orbital cycle, where the cooler plasma could be\ndue to the small scale shocks in a radiation-driven outflow and the high\ntemperature plasma could be due to the collision of winds. The column density\nvaried with the orbital phase and was found to be maximum after the periastron\npassage, when the WN star is in front of the O star. The abundances of WR 25\nwere found to be non-solar. Optical V-band data of WR 25 also show the\nphase-locked variability, being at maximum near periastron passage. The results\nbased on the present analysis indicate that WR 25 is a colliding wind binary\nwhere the presence of soft X-rays is attributed to individual components;\nhowever, hard X-rays are due to the collision of winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 07:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-29"}

It allows unlicensed secondary users (SUs) to exploit\nopportunistically the under-utilized licensed spectrum. Market mechanism is a\nwidely-used promising means to regulate the consuming behaviours of users and,\nhence, achieves the efficient allocation and consumption of limited resources.\nIn this paper, we propose and study a hybrid secondary spectrum market\nconsisting of both the futures market and the spot market, in which SUs\n(buyers) purchase under-utilized licensed spectrum from a spectrum regulator,\neither through predefined contracts via the futures market, or through spot\ntransactions via the spot market.

To solve this problem, we first derive an\noff-line optimal allocation policy that maximizes the ex-ante expected spectrum\nutilization efficiency based on the stochastic distribution of network\ninformation.

This feature is a quintuplet of semiforbidden transitions\nexcited at electron temperatures around 10,000 K that, together with the nearby\nSi II] and Fe II] features, provides a reliable optically thin tracer for\naccurate measurement of the plasma properties in the magnetospheres of TTSs.\nThe spectra of 20 (out of 27) TTSs observed with the Space Telescope Imaging\nSpectrograph (STIS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have good enough\nsignal to noise ratio (S/N) at the C II] wavelength. For these stars we have\ndetermined electron densities (ne) and temperatures (Te) in the line emission\nregion as well as the profile broadening (sigma). For most of the stars in the\nsample (17) we obtain 10^{4.1} < Te < 10^{4.5} K and 10^{8} < ne < 10^{12}\ncm^{-3}. These stars have suprathermal line broadening (35 < sigma < 165 km\ns^{-1}), except TW Hya and CY Tau with thermal line broadening. Both C II] line\nluminosity and broadening are found to correlate with the accretion rate. Line\nemission seems to be produced in the magnetospheric accretion flow, close to\nthe disk. There are three exceptions: DG Tau, RY Tau and FU Ori. The line\ncentroids are blueshifted indicating that the line emission in these three\nstars is dominated by the outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 10:12:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 10:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In this paper, we present a\nnovel phenomenological fit to the Planck, WMAP polarisation (WP) and the BICEP2\ndatasets using an alternative parameterisation. Instead of starting from\ninflationary potentials and computing the inflationary observables, we use a\nphenomenological parameterisation due to Mukhanov, describing inflation by an\neffective equation-of-state, in terms of the number of e-folds and two\nphenomenological parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Within such a\nparametrisation, which captures the different inflationary models in a\nmodel-independent way, the values of the scalar spectral index $n_s$, its\nrunning and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are predicted, given a set of\nparameters $(\\alpha,\\beta)$. We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of\nthese parameters, and we show that the combined analysis of Planck and WP data\nfavours the Starobinsky and Higgs inflation scenarios. Assuming that the BICEP2\nsignal is not entirely due to foregrounds, the addition of this last data set\nprefers instead the $\\phi^2$ chaotic models.

The key feature of the proposed method is its high\nversatility since it does not require specific assumptions on the system to be\napproximated. The only requirement is that of being able to run multiple\nsimulations of the system behavior for different input realizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 11:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-29"}

In this work, we propose and\ncheck a scheme to balance and equalize the resolution of SPH between high- and\nlow-density regions.

The analysis of the hydrodynamical simulations suggests\nthat the scheme devised to equalizing accuracy improves the treatment of the\npost-shock regions and, in general, of the rarefacted zones of fluids while\ncausing no harm to the growth of hydrodynamic instabilities.

We analysed the EmU supported\nby two chiral cosmological fields for a spatially flat universe, while we have\nused three chiral fields when we investigated open and closed universes. To\nprove the validity of the EmU scenario we fixed the scale factor and found the\nexact solution by decomposition of EGB equations and solving the chiral field\ndynamics equation. To this end, we suggested the decomposition of the EGB\nequations in such a way that the first chiral field is responsible for the\nEinstein part of the model, while the second field, together with kinetic\ninteraction term, is connected with the Gauss--Bonnet part of the theory. We\nproved that both fields are phantom ones under this decomposition, and that the\nmodel has a solution if the kinetic interaction between the fields equals a\nconstant. We have presented the exact solution in terms of cosmic time. This\nwas done for a spatially flat universe. In the case of open and closed\nuniverses we introduced the third chiral field (canonical for closed and\nphantom for open universe) which is responsible for the EGB and curvature\nparts. The solution of the third field equation is obtained in quadratures.\nThus we have proved that the CCM is able to support EmU scenario in EGB gravity\nfor spatially flat, open and closed universes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 12:42:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The interaction\nstrengths of the ladder are tunable by adjusting magnetic and electric fields\nas well as the spacing between the gates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the\neffective spin ladder has a helical nature, meaning that the spin-correlations\nmay be probed rather simply with charge transport experiments.

However for intrinsically unstructured proteins, alpha-helical\nproteins or proteins containing several disordered fragments, the assignment\nbecomes problematic because of high degree of backbone shift degeneracy. In\nthis backdrop, a novel reduced dimensionality (RD) experiment\n-(5,3)D-hNCO-CANH- is presented to facilitate (and/or to validate) the\nsequential backbone resonance assignment in such proteins. The proposed 3D NMR\nexperiment makes use of the modulated amide 15N chemical shifts (resulting from\nthe joint sampling along both its indirect dimensions) to resolve the ambiguity\ninvolved in connecting the neighboring amide resonances (i.e. HiNi and\nHi-1Ni-1) for overlapping amide NH peaks. The experiment -encoding 5D spectral\ninformation- leads to a conventional 3D spectrum with significantly reduced\nspectral crowding and complexity. The improvisation is based on the fact that\nthe linear combinations of intra-residue and inter-residue backbone chemical\nshifts along both the co-evolved indirect dimensions span a wider spectral\nrange and produce better peak dispersion than the individual shifts themselves.\nTaken together, the experiment -in combination with routine triple resonance 3D\nNMR experiments involving backbone amide (1H and 15N) and carbon (13C-alpha and\n13C') chemical shifts- will serve as a powerful complementary tool to achieve\nthe nearly complete assignment of protein backbone resonances in a time\nefficient manner. The performance of the experiment and application of the\nmethod have been demonstrated here using a 15.4 kDa size folded protein and a\n12 kDa size unfolded protein.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 13:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-11"}

This paper presents a\ndata-driven approach of finding optimal transmission policies for a\nsolar-powered sensor node that attempts to maximize net bit rates by adapting\nits transmission parameters, power levels and modulation types, to the changes\nof channel fading and battery recharge. We formulate this problem as a\ndiscounted Markov decision process (MDP) framework, whereby the energy\nharvesting process is stochastically quantized into several representative\nsolar states with distinct energy arrivals and is totally driven by historical\ndata records at a sensor node. With the observed solar irradiance at each time\nepoch, a mixed strategy is developed to compute the belief information of the\nunderlying solar states for the choice of transmission parameters. In addition,\na theoretical analysis is conducted for a simple on-off policy, in which a\npredetermined transmission parameter is utilized whenever a sensor node is\nactive. We prove that such an optimal policy has a threshold structure with\nrespect to battery states and evaluate the performance of an energy harvesting\nnode by analyzing the expected net bit rate. The design framework is\nexemplified with real solar data records, and the results are useful in\ncharacterizing the interplay that occurs between energy harvesting and\nexpenditure under various system configurations.

First we study the sampling\napproaches over diffusion networks, and for the first time, classify these\napproaches into two categories; (1) Structure-based Sampling (SBS), and (2)\nDiffusion-based Sampling (DBS). The dependency of the former approach to\ntopological features of the network, and unavailability of real diffusion paths\nin the latter, converts the problem of choosing an appropriate sampling\napproach to a trade-off.

Therefore, in real large scale systems with\nlow sampling rate requirements, SBS would be a better choice according to its\nlower time complexity in gathering data compared to DBS.

It has been widely\nobserved that each of these definitions is of one of two types: algebraic\ndefinitions, in which composites and coherence cells are explicitly specified,\nand non-algebraic definitions, in which a coherent choice of composites and\nconstraint cells is merely required to exist. Relatively few comparisons have\nbeen made between definitions, and most of those that have concern the\nrelationship between definitions of just one type. The aim of this thesis is to\nestablish more comparisons, including a comparison between an algebraic\ndefinition and a non-algebraic definition.\n  The thesis is divided into two parts. Part 1 concerns the relationships\nbetween three algebraic definitions of weak n-category: those of Penon and\nBatanin, and Leinster's variant of Batanin's definition. A correspondence\nbetween the structures used to define composition and coherence in the\ndefinitions of Batanin and Leinster has long been suspected; we make this\nprecise for the first time. We use this correspondence to prove several\ncoherence theorems that apply to all three definitions, and to take the first\nsteps towards describing the relationship between the weak n-categories of\nBatanin and Leinster.\n  In Part 2 we take the first step towards a comparison between Penon's\ndefinition of weak n-category and a non-algebraic definition, Simpson's variant\nof Tamsamani's definition, in the form of a nerve construction. As a prototype\nfor this nerve construction, we recall a nerve construction for bicategories\nproposed by Leinster, and prove that the nerve of a bicategory given by this\nconstruction is a Tamsamani--Simpson weak 2-category. We then define our nerve\nfunctor for Penon weak n-categories. We prove that the nerve of a Penon weak\n2-category is a Tamsamani--Simpson weak 2-category, and conjecture that this\nresult holds for higher n.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 14:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-29"}

In\nthe same line, considerable emphasis has been recently given to two apparently\ndisjoint research topics: data-parallel, and eventually consistent, distributed\nsystems. Declarative networking has been recently proposed to ease the task of\nprogramming in the cloud, by allowing the programmer to express only the\ndesired result and leave the implementation details to the responsibility of\nthe run-time system. In this context, we propose a study on a\nlogic-programming-based computational model for eventually consistent,\ndata-parallel systems, the keystone of which is provided by the recent finding\nthat the class of programs that can be computed in an eventually consistent,\ncoordination-free way is that of monotonic programs. This principle is called\nCALM and has been proven by Ameloot et al. for distributed, asynchronous\nsettings. We advocate that CALM should be employed as a basic theoretical tool\nalso for data-parallel systems, wherein computation usually proceeds\nsynchronously in rounds and where communication is assumed to be reliable. It\nis general opinion that coordination-freedom can be seen as a major\ndiscriminant factor. In this work we make the case that the current form of\nCALM does not hold in general for data-parallel systems, and show how, using\nnovel techniques, the satisfiability of the CALM principle can still be\nobtained although just for the subclass of programs called connected monotonic\nqueries. We complete the study with considerations on the relationships between\nour model and the one employed by Ameloot et al., showing that our techniques\nsubsume the latter when the synchronization constraints imposed on the system\nare loosened.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 14:47:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 May 2014 16:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 02:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 9 Jul 2018 00:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

Moreover, the meteoritic precipitation plays a\nsignificant role in surface emission processes. This emitted material is\npartially lost in space. Although under the present conditions the surface\nparticles loss rate does not seem to be able to produce significant erosion of\nthe planetary mass and volume, the long-term effects over billions of years\nshould be carefully considered to properly understand the evolution of the\nplanet. In the early stages, under even more extreme conditions, some of these\nprocesses were much more effective in removing material from the planet's\nsurface. This study attempts to provide a rough estimation of the material loss\nrate as a function of time, in order to evaluate whether and how this\nenvironmental effect can be applied to understand the Hermean surface\nevolution. We show that the most potentially effective Sun-induced erosion\nprocess in early times is a combination of ion sputtering, photon stimulated\ndesorption and enhanced diffusion, which could have caused the loss of a\nsurface layer down to a depth of 20 m, as well as a relevant Na depletion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 15:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

For high-mass species, the resulting charge state\ndistribution can be complex and difficult to interpret correctly. In this\narticle, using a setup comprising both conventional time-of-flight MS (TOF-MS)\nand Nano-Electro-Mechanical-Systems-based MS (NEMS-MS) in situ, we show\ndirectly that NEMS-MS analysis is insensitive to charge state: the spectrum\nconsists of a single peak whatever the species charge state, making it\nsignificantly clearer than existing MS analysis. In subsequent tests, all\ncharged particles are electrostatically removed from the beam, and unlike\nTOF-MS, NEMS-MS can still measure masses. This demonstrates the possibility to\nmeasure mass spectra for neutral particles. Thus, it is possible to envisage\nMS-based studies of analytes that are incompatible with current ionization\ntechniques and the way is now open for the development of cutting edge system\narchitectures with unique analytical capability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 15:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 12:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Despite other techniques\ncommonly seek through the parameter map, LA explores in the probability space\nproviding appropriate convergence properties and robustness. The segmentation\ntask is therefore considered as an optimization problem and the LA is used to\ngenerate the image multi-threshold separation. In this approach, one 1D\nhistogram of a given image is approximated through a Gaussian mixture model\nwhose parameters are calculated using the LA algorithm. Each Gaussian function\napproximating the histogram represents a pixel class and therefore a threshold\npoint.

These hotspots are considerably more enriched in\n$^{18}O$ and $^{15}N$ than the host graphite grain.
