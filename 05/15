The\ncommon practice today is that each user downloads the video independently on\nher mobile device using her own cellular connection, which wastes access\nbandwidth and may also lead to poor video quality. We propose a novel\ncooperative system where each mobile device uses simultaneously two network\ninterfaces: (i) the cellular to connect to the video server and download parts\nof the video and (ii) WiFi to connect locally to all other devices in the group\nand exchange those parts. Devices cooperate to efficiently utilize all network\nresources and are able to adapt to varying wireless network conditions. In the\nlocal WiFi network, we exploit overhearing, and we further combine it with\nnetwork coding. The end result is savings in cellular bandwidth and improved\nuser experience (faster download) by a factor on the order up to the group\nsize.\n  We follow a complete approach, from theory to practice. First, we formulate\nthe problem using a network utility maximization (NUM) framework, decompose the\nproblem, and provide a distributed solution. Then, based on the structure of\nthe NUM solution, we design a modular system called MicroCast and we implement\nit as an Android application. We provide both simulation results of the NUM\nsolution and experimental evaluation of MicroCast on a testbed consisting of\nAndroid phones. We demonstrate that the proposed approach brings significant\nperformance benefits without battery penalty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 18:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-16"}

They\nalso provide limited (but expanding) query languages. Their idiomatic, non-SQL\nlanguage constructs, the many variations, and the lack of formal semantics\ninhibit deep understanding of the query languages, and also impede progress\ntowards clean, powerful, declarative query languages.\n  This paper specifies the syntax and semantics of SQL++, which is applicable\nto both JSON native stores and SQL databases. The SQL++ semi-structured data\nmodel is a superset of both JSON and the SQL data model. SQL++ offers powerful\ncomputational capabilities for processing semi-structured data akin to prior\nnon-relational query languages, notably OQL and XQuery. Yet, SQL++ is SQL\nbackwards compatible and is generalized towards JSON by introducing only a\nsmall number of query language extensions to SQL.\n  Recognizing that a query language standard is probably premature for the fast\nevolving area of NoSQL databases, SQL++ includes configuration options that\nformally itemize the semantics variations that language designers may choose\nfrom.

With the aim of identifying the models which best satisfy well known\nproperties of nuclear matter, we have analyzed $263$ parameterizations of seven\ndifferent types of RMF models under three different sets of constraints related\nto symmetric nuclear matter, pure neutron matter, symmetry energy, and its\nderivatives.

The results pointed to $2$ models\nconsistent with all constraints.

The broad correspondence between the high-frequency\nradio data and the high-energy (HE) emission is striking.

The fact that\nNGC 1275 is also detected at TeV energies during the periods of HE gamma-ray\nflaring suggests that the short-timescale variation might be primarily related\nto changes in the inverse Compton scattering of photons by the electron\npopulation in the jet.

This\ndeviation is in nice agreement with the correlation recently discovered in\nlocal galaxies between gas metallicity and environment, which has been ascribed\nto enriched inter-galactic medium (IGM) in dense environments, and therefore\nsuggests that here the IGM was already significantly enriched by z~1.5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 20:00:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 08:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The sample size of these objects has remained small\ndue, at least in part, to the challenge of detecting short timescale transients\nwith traditional survey cadences. Here we present the results from a search\nwithin the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS) for rapidly-evolving and\nluminous transients. We identify 10 new transients with a time above\nhalf-maximum of less than 12 days and -16.5 > M > -20 mag. This increases the\nnumber of known events in this region of SN phase space by roughly a factor of\nthree. The median redshift of the PS1-MDS sample is z=0.275 and they all\nexploded in star forming galaxies. In general, the transients possess faster\nrise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g - r < -0.2).\nBest fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/cool\nwith time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by a\nblue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. We find it\ndifficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (L > 10^43\nerg/s), and lack of UV line blanketing observed in many of these transients\nwith an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of Ni-56. Rather, we\nfind that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission from\nthe explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope which ejected very\nlittle (<0.03 M_sun) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within a\ndense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star.

A solution of this issue is the physically motivated scaling\nof the airglow lines in the plain sky data to fit the sky lines in the object\nspectrum. We have developed a corresponding instrument-independent approach\nbased on one-dimensional spectra. Our code skycorr separates sky lines and\nsky/object continuum by an iterative approach involving a line finder and\nairglow line data.

Scalar masses arise from one-loop finite contributions as\nwell as direct gravity-mediated contributions. Like split supersymmetry, one\nHiggs doublet is fine-tuned to be light. The scale at which the Dirac gauginos\nare introduced to make the Higgs quartic zero is the same as is necessary for\ngauge coupling unification. Thus, gauge coupling unification persists\n(nontrivially, due to adjoint multiplets), though with a somewhat higher\nunification scale $\\gtrsim 10^{17}$ GeV. The $\\mu$-term is naturally at the\nweak scale, and provides an opportunity for experimental verification. We\npresent two manifestations of Split Dirac Supersymmetry. In the \"Pure Dirac\"\nmodel, the lightest Higgsino must decay through R-parity violating couplings,\nleading to an array of interesting signals in colliders. In the \"Hypercharge\nImpure\" model, the bino acquires a Majorana mass that is one-loop suppressed\ncompared with the Dirac gluino and wino. This leads to weak scale Higgsino dark\nmatter whose overall mass scale, as well as the mass splitting between the\nneutral components, is naturally generated from the same UV dynamics.

Common to them is that the problem specification\nevolves during the reasoning process, either because data or constraints are\nadded, deleted, or replaced. In fact, clingo 4 carries out such complex\nreasoning within a single integrated ASP grounding and solving process. This\navoids redundancies in relaunching grounder and solver programs and benefits\nfrom the solver's learning capacities. clingo 4 accomplishes this by\ncomplementing ASP's declarative input language by control capacities expressed\nvia the embedded scripting languages lua and python.

The adopted method combines Direct\nNumerical Simulation of the turbulent field with a Discrete Element Method\nbased on Stokesian dynamics. In this way, not only the mechanics of the\naggregate is modelled in detail, but the internal stresses are evaluated while\nthe aggregate is moving in the turbulent flow. We examine doublets and\ncluster-cluster isostatic aggregates, where the failure of a single contact\nleads to the rupture of the aggregate and breakup occurs when the tensile force\nat a contact exceeds the cohesive strength of the bond. Due to the different\nrole of the internal stresses, the functional relationship between breakup\nfrequency and turbulence dissipation rate is very different in the two cases.\nIn the limit of very small and very large values, the frequency of breakup\nscales exponentially with the turbulence dissipation rate for doublets, while\nit follows a power law for cluster-cluster aggregates. For the case of large\nisostatic aggregates it is confirmed that the proper scaling length for maximum\nstress and breakup is the radius of gyration. The cumulative fragment\ndistribution function is nearly independent of the mean turbulence dissipation\nrate and can be approximated by the sum of a small erosive component and a term\nthat is quadratic with respect to fragment size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 21:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

This article is focused on the\ninvestigation of diversity techniques to improve the physical-layer security,\ndiffering from the conventional artificial noise generation and beamforming\ntechniques which typically consume additional power for generating artificial\nnoise and exhibit high implementation complexity for beamformer design. We\npresent several diversity approaches to improve the wireless physical-layer\nsecurity, including the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), multiuser\ndiversity, and cooperative diversity.

We evaluate the security performance of\ncooperative relay transmission in Rayleigh fading environments in terms of\nsecrecy capacity and intercept probability. It is shown that as the number of\nrelays increases, the secrecy capacity and intercept probability of the\ncooperative relay transmission both improve significantly, implying the\nadvantage of exploiting cooperative diversity to improve the physical-layer\nsecurity against eavesdropping attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2014 02:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

We show that\nthis anomalous signal can be explained in annihilating dark matter model, for\nexample, fermionic dark matter model in hidden sector with global $U(1)_X$\nsymmetry proposed by Weinberg. There are two scenarios for the production of\nthe annihilating dark matters. In the first scenario the dark matters with mass\n3.55 keV decouple from the interaction with Goldstone bosons and go out of\nthermal equilibrium at high temperature ($>$ 1 TeV) when they are still\nrelativistic, their number density per comoving volume being essentially fixed\nto be the current value. The correct relic abundance of this warm dark matter\nis obtained by assuming that about ${\\cal O}(10^3)$ relativistic degrees of\nfreedom were present at the decoupling temperature or alternatively large\nentropy production occurred at high temperature. In the other scenario, the\ndark matters were absent at high temperature, and as the universe cools down,\nthe SM particles annihilate or decay to produce the dark matters non-thermally\nas in `freeze-in' scenario. It turns out that the DM production from Higgs\ndecay is the dominant one. In the model we considered, only the first scenario\ncan explain both X-ray signal and relic abundance.

However a widely accepted, accurate\nand easy-to-use quantitative formula on it still lacks. In this paper, by\nnormalizing the governing equations, an almost analytical model is developed,\nexcept a single-variable function of the dimensionless Biot number which cannot\nbe determined analytically and is then given by a curve. Formulae for various\ntypical geometries and working conditions are presented. If the stress and the\ndiffusion process are fully coupled (i.e. stress-dependent diffusion), as in\nlithium ion diffusion, the normalized maximum DIS can be characterized by a\ntwo-variable function of a dimensionless coupling parameter and the Biot\nnumber, which is obtained numerically and presented in contour plots. Moreover,\nit is interesting to note that these two parameters, within a wide range, can\nbe further approximately combined into a single dimensionless parameter to\ncharacterize the maximum DIS. These formulae together with curves/contours\nprovide engineers and materialists a simple and easy way to quickly obtain the\nstress and verify the reliability of materials under various typical diffusion\nconditions. Via energy balance analysis, the model of diffusion induced\nfracture is also developed. It interestingly predicts that the spacing of\ndiffusion induced cracks is constant, independent of the thickness of specimen\nand the concentration difference. Our thermal shock experiments on alumina\nplates validate these qualitative and quantitative theoretical predictions,\nsuch as the constant crack spacing and the predicted critical temperature\ndifference at which the cracks initiate. Furthermore, the proposed model can\ninterpret the observed hierarchical crack patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2014 03:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-16"}

One prominent\nexample of this class are shearlets, which have the additional benefitallowing\nfaithful implementations. Numerical results show that shearlets significantly\noutperform wavelets in inpainting tasks. One of those software packages,\nwww.shearlab.org, even offers the flexibility of usingdifferent parameter for\neach scale, which is not yet covered by shearlet theory.\n  In this paper, we first introduce universal shearlet systems which are\nassociated with an arbitrary scaling sequence, thereby modeling the previously\nmentioned flexibility.

Assuming particle systems, we construct the\ngrand-canonical TPQ (gTPQ) state, which is the counterpart of the\ngrand-canonical Gibbs state of the ensemble formulation. A single realization\nof the gTPQ state gives all quantities of statistical-mechanical interest, with\nexponentially small probability of error. This formulation not only sheds new\nlight on quantum statistical mechanics but also is useful for practical\ncomputations. As an illustration, we apply it to the Hubbard model, on a\none-dimensional (1d) chain and on a two-dimensional (2d) triangular lattice.\nFor the 1d chain, our results agree well with the exact solutions over wide\nranges of temperature, chemical potential and the on-site interaction.

The\nMIMC method is both a stochastic version of the combination technique\nintroduced by Zenger, Griebel and collaborators and an extension of the\nMultilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method first described by Heinrich and Giles.\nInspired by Giles's seminal work, we use in MIMC high-order mixed differences\ninstead of using first-order differences as in MLMC to reduce the variance of\nthe hierarchical differences dramatically. This in turn yields new and improved\ncomplexity results, which are natural generalizations of Giles's MLMC analysis\nand which increase the domain of the problem parameters for which we achieve\nthe optimal convergence, $\\mathcal{O}(\\text{TOL}^{-2}).$ Moreover, in MIMC, the\nrate of increase of required memory with respect to $\\text{TOL}$ is independent\nof the number of directions up to a logarithmic term which allows far more\naccurate solutions to be calculated for higher dimensions than what is possible\nwhen using MLMC.\n  We motivate the setting of MIMC by first focusing on a simple full tensor\nindex set. We then propose a systematic construction of optimal sets of indices\nfor MIMC based on properly defined profits that in turn depend on the average\ncost per sample and the corresponding weak error and variance. Under standard\nassumptions on the convergence rates of the weak error, variance and work per\nsample, the optimal index set turns out to be the total degree (TD) type.

While recent advances in this area of research\nfocused on the employed motion sensors and the camera as well as the sound, we\ninvestigate a less obvious source of information leakage, namely the ambient\nlight. We successfully demonstrate that minor tilts and turns of mobile devices\ncause variations of the ambient-light sensor information.

Here, we introduce the\nexclusive quantum channels (EQC) as the measure of efficiency of quantum\ninformation transmission. It quantifies the amount of quantum information which\ncan be teleported between nodes in a quantum network. We show that different\ntypes of EQC are local quantities with effective circles. Significantly,\ncapacity of quantum communication of quantum networks quantified by EQC is\nindependent of distance for the communicating nodes.

In it, transactions are written in a logic-programming style, by\ncombining primitive update operations over a general KB, with the usual logic\nprogramming connectives and some additional connectives e.g. to express\nsequence of actions. While TR is a natural choice to deal with transactions, it\nremains the question whether TR can be used to express complex events, but also\nto deal simultaneously with the detection of complex events and the execution\nof transactions. In this paper we show that the former is possible while the\nlatter is not. For that, we start by illustrating how TR can express complex\nevents, and in particular, how SNOOP event expressions can be translated in the\nlogic. Afterwards, we show why TR fails to deal with the two issues together,\nand to solve the intended problem propose Transaction Logic with Events, its\nsyntax, model theory and executional semantics. The achieved solution is a\nnon-monotonic extension of TR, which guarantees that every complex event\ndetected in a transaction is necessarily responded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2014 10:18:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-16"}

All 24 high confidence members are\nconfirmed as young very low mass objects with spectral types from M5 to L1,\n15-20 of them are likely brown dwarfs. This high yield confirms that brown\ndwarfs in Upper Scorpius can be identified from photometry and proper motions\nalone, with negligible contamination from field objects (<4%). Out of the 6\ncandidates with lower confidence, 5 might still be young very low mass members\nof Upper Scorpius, according to our spectroscopy. We demonstrate that some very\nlow mass class II objects exhibit radically different near infrared (0.6 -\n2.5micron) spectra from class III objects, with strong excess emission\nincreasing towards longer wavelengths and partially filled in features at\nwavelengths shorter than 1.25micron.

Linked partitions arise in free probability\ntheory. Motivated by the Hecke insertion algorithm, we define a Hecke diagram\nas a Young diagram possibly with a marked corner. A vacillating Hecke tableau\nis defined as a sequence of Hecke diagrams subject to certain addition and\ndeletion of rook strips. The notion of a rook strip was introduced by Buch in\nthe study of the Littlewood-Richardson rule for stable Grothendieck\npolynomials. A rook strip is a skew Young diagram with at most one square in\neach row and column.

However due to the Z-Z' mixing\nalso corresponding contributions from Z boson are present that are usually\nneglected. We calculate the impact of these contributions on Delta F=2\nprocesses and rare K, B_s and B_d decays for different values of a parameter\nbeta, which distinguishes between various 331 models and for different fermion\nrepresentations under the SU(3)_L group. We find a general expression for the\nZ-Z' mixing in terms beta, M_Z, M_Z' and tan(bar{beta}), familiar from 2 Higgs\nDoublet models, that differs from the one quoted in the literature. We study in\nparticular the models with beta=+-n/sqrt{3} with n=1,2 which have recently been\ninvestigated by us in the context of new data on B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^- and\nB_d->K^*(K)mu^+ mu^-. We find that these new contributions can indeed be\nneglected in the case of Delta F=2 transitions and decays, like\nB_d->K^*mu^+mu^-, where they are suppressed by the small vectorial Z coupling\nto charged leptons. However the contributions of tree-level Z exchanges to\ndecays sensitive to axial-vector couplings, like B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^- and B_d->K\nmu^+ mu^-, and those with neutrinos in the final state, like b->s nu bar{nu}\ntransitions, K^+->pi^+ nu bar{nu} and K_L->pi^0 nu bar{nu} cannot be generally\nneglected with size of Z contributions depending on beta, tan(bar{beta}) and\nM_Z'. We analyze for the first time the ratio epsilon'/epsilon in these models\nincluding both Z' and Z contributions.

These states alternate\nwith intervals of 13-16 yr, and are well defined after 1943. The 40.8 d\nperiodical modulations of the amplitude and the period (i.e. Blazhko effect)\nwere noticed in 1916.

The high-$Q^2$ processes\nassociated with the QCD evolution of the jet from production as a single hard\nparton through its fragmentation, up to but not including hadronization, are\ntreated perturbatively. The interactions between the partons in the shower and\nthe deconfined matter within which they find themselves lead to energy loss.\nThe momentum scales associated with the medium (of the order of the\ntemperature) and with typical interactions between partons in the shower and\nthe medium are sufficiently soft that strongly coupled physics plays an\nimportant role in energy loss. We model these interactions using qualitative\ninsights from holographic calculations of the energy loss of energetic light\nquarks and gluons in a strongly coupled plasma, obtained via gauge/gravity\nduality. We embed this hybrid model into a hydrodynamic description of the\nspacetime evolution of the hot QCD matter produced in heavy ion collisions and\nconfront its predictions with jet data from the LHC. The holographic expression\nfor the energy loss of a light quark or gluon that we incorporate in our hybrid\nmodel is parametrized by a stopping distance.

We perturb the internal\nconductivity distribution by applying time-harmonic mechanical vibrations on\nthe boundary. This enhances the effects of any conductivity discontinuity on\nthe induced internal current density distribution. Unlike other conductivity\ncontrast enhancing frameworks, it does not require a prior knowledge of a\nreference data. In this paper, we provide a mathematical framework for this\nnovel imaging modality. As an application of the vibration-assisted impedance\nimaging framework, we propose a new breast image reconstruction method in\nelectrical impedance tomography (EIT). As its another application, we\ninvestigate a conductivity anomaly detection problem and provide an efficient\nlocation search algorithm. We show both analytically and numerically that the\napplied mechanical vibration increases the data sensitivity to the conductivity\ncontrast and enhances the quality of reconstructed images and anomaly detection\nresults. For numerous applications in impedance imaging, the proposed\nmulti-physics method opens a new difference imaging area called the\nvibration-difference imaging, which can augment the time-difference and also\nfrequency-difference imaging methods for sensitivity improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 23:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}
