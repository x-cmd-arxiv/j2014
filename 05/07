Second, we can search for\nnew cosmological signatures as a way to explore physics beyond the standard\ncosmic paradigm.

These models have achieved a series of considerable\ndevelopments in recent years, in particular in their perturbative frameworks,\nwhich made brand-new predictions of cosmological signatures that could be\nvisible in current and forthcoming observations.

In the setting of this paradigm, we propose some possible\nmechanisms of generating a red tilt for primordial curvature perturbations and\nconfront its general predictions with recent cosmological observations. The\nsecond is the matter-bounce inflation scenario which can be viewed as an\nextension of inflationary cosmology with a matter contraction before inflation.\nWe present a class of possible model constructions and review its implications\non the current CMB experiments.

In a well-trained\nmodel, the lower layer of the architecture models the data distribution\nconditional upon the hidden variables, while the higher layers model the hidden\ndistribution prior. But due to the greedy scheme of the layerwise training\ntechnique, the parameters of lower layers are fixed when training higher\nlayers. This makes it extremely challenging for the model to learn the hidden\ndistribution prior, which in turn leads to a suboptimal model for the data\ndistribution. We therefore investigate joint training of deep autoencoders,\nwhere the architecture is viewed as one stack of two or more single-layer\nautoencoders. A single global reconstruction objective is jointly optimized,\nsuch that the objective for the single autoencoders at each layer acts as a\nlocal, layer-level regularizer. We empirically evaluate the performance of this\njoint training scheme and observe that it not only learns a better data model,\nbut also learns better higher layer representations, which highlights its\npotential for unsupervised feature learning. In addition, we find that the\nusage of regularizations in the joint training scheme is crucial in achieving\ngood performance. In the supervised setting, joint training also shows superior\nperformance when training deeper models. The joint training framework can thus\nprovide a platform for investigating more efficient usage of different types of\nregularizers, especially in light of the growing volumes of available unlabeled\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2014 17:41:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Jun 2014 15:48:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 18:02:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 23:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

There is however some agreement on the fact that the\ncarcinogenic process is a result of several genetic mutations of normal cells.\nThe colon epithelium is characterized by millions of invaginations, very small\ncavities, called crypts, where most of the cellular activity occurs. It is\nconsensual in the medical community, that a potential first manifestation of\nthe carcinogenic process, observed in conventional colonoscopy images, is the\nappearance of Aberrant Crypt Foci (ACF). These are clusters of abnormal crypts,\nmorphologically characterized by an atypical behavior of the cells that\npopulate the crypts. In this work an homogenization model is proposed, for\nrepresenting the cellular dynamics in the colon epithelium. The goal is to\nsimulate and predict, in silico, the spread and evolution of ACF, as it can be\nobserved in colonoscopy images. By assuming that the colon is an heterogeneous\nmedia, exhibiting a periodic distribution of crypts, we start this work by\ndescribing a periodic model, that represents the ACF cell-dynamics in a\ntwo-dimensional setting. Then, homogenization techniques are applied to this\nperiodic model, to find a simpler model, whose solution symbolizes the averaged\nbehavior of ACF at the tissue level. Some theoretical results concerning the\nexistence of solution of the homogenized model are proven, applying a fixed\npoint theorem.

The typical stellar mass\nof this sample is Mstar~2x10^{11} Msun. We analyze the evolution of the galaxy\nparameters effective radius, stellar velocity dispersion, and the dynamical to\nstellar mass ratio with redshift. As the effective radii of BOSS galaxies at\nthese redshifts are not well resolved in the SDSS imaging we calibrate the SDSS\nsize measurements with HST/COSMOS photometry for a sub-sample of galaxies. We\nfurther apply a correction for progenitor bias to build a sample which consists\nof a coeval, passively evolving population. Systematic errors due to size\ncorrection and the calculation of dynamical mass, are assessed through Monte\nCarlo simulations. At fixed stellar or dynamical mass, we find moderate\nevolution in galaxy size and stellar velocity dispersion, in agreement with\nprevious studies. We show that this results in a decrease of the dynamical to\nstellar mass ratio with redshift at >2sigma significance. By combining our\nsample with high-redshift literature data we find that this evolution of the\ndynamical to stellar mass ratio continues beyond z~0.7 up to z>2 as Mdyn/Mstar~\n(1+z)^{-0.30+/- 0.12} further strengthening the evidence for an increase of\nMdyn/Mstar with cosmic time. This result is in line with recent predictions\nfrom galaxy formation simulations based on minor merger driven mass growth, in\nwhich the dark matter fraction within the half-light radius increases with\ncosmic time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2014 20:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

At sufficiently\nlarge scales such as the BAO scale, a standard approach for the bias problem on\nthe basis of the perturbation theory (PT) is to assume the `local bias' model\nin which the density field of biased tracers is deterministically expanded in\nterms of matter density field at the same position. The higher-order bias\nparameters are then determined by combining the power spectrum with\nhigher-order statistics such as the bispectrum. As is pointed out by recent\nstudies, however, nonlinear gravitational evolution naturally induces nonlocal\nbias terms even if initially starting only with purely local bias. As a matter\nof fact, previous works showed that the second-order nonlocal bias term, which\ncorresponds to the gravitational tidal field, is important to explain the\ncharacteristic scale-dependence of the bispectrum. In this paper we extend the\nnonlocal bias term up to third order, and investigate whether the PT-based\nmodel including nonlocal bias terms can simultaneously explain the power\nspectrum and the bispectrum of simulated halos in $N$-body simulations. We show\nthat the power spectrum, including density and momentum, and the bispectrum\nbetween halo and matter in $N$-body simulations can be simultaneously well\nexplained by the model including up to third-order nonlocal bias terms up to\nk~0.1h/Mpc. Also, the results seem in a good agreement with theoretical\npredictions of a simple coevolution picture, although the agreement is not\nperfect. These demonstration clearly shows a failure of the local bias model\neven at such large scales, and we conclude that nonlocal bias terms should be\nconsistently included in order to model statistics of halos.

In\norder to compare the dynamics, we also analyze a sample of 42 Jupiter family\ncomets (JFCs) in near-Earth orbits, i.e. with $q < 1.3$ au. We integrated the\norbits of these two samples for $10^4$ yr in the past and in the future. We\nfind that the great majority of the NEAs move on stable orbits during the\nconsidered period, and that a large proportion of them are in one of the main\nmean motion resonances with Jupiter, in particular the 2:1. We find a strong\ncoupling between the perihelion distance and the inclination in the motion of\nmost NEAs, due to Kozai mechanism, that generates many sungrazers. On the other\nhand, most JFCs are found to move on very unstable orbits, showing large\nvariations in their perihelion distances in the last few $10^2 - 10^3$ yr,\nwhich suggests a rather recent capture in their current near-Earth orbits. Even\nthough most NEAs of our sample move in typical 'asteroidal' orbits, we detect a\nsmall group of NEAs whose orbits are highly unstable, resembling those of the\nJFCs. These are: 1997 SE5, 2000 DN1, 2001 XQ, 2002 GJ8, 2002 RN38, 2003 CC11,\n2003 WY25, 2009 CR2, and 2011 OL51. These objects might be inactive comets, and\nindeed 2003 WY25 has been associated with comet Blanpain, and it is now\ndesigned as comet 289P/Blanpain. Under the assumption that these objects are\ninactive comets, we can set an upper limit of $\\sim 0.17$ to the fraction of\nNEAs with $Q > 4.8$ au of cometary origin, but it could be even lower if the\nNEAs in unstable orbits listed before turn out to be {\\it bona fide} asteroids\nfrom the main belt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2014 20:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

We trace the 3D topology of individual\nfeatures located in the super-penumbral canopy, mainly radially oriented\nfibrils. We find that about half of the fibrils form short, arched, low-lying\nloops in the temperature cube. These closed loops connect from bright grains\nthat are either in or close to the penumbra to the photosphere a few Mms away\nfrom the sunspot. They reach less than 1 Mm in height. The other half of the\nfibrils rise with distance from the sunspot until they leave the Ca II IR\nformation height. Many of the fibrils show a central dark core and two lateral\nbrightenings as seen in line-core intensity images. The corresponding velocity\nimage shows fibrils that are as wide as the fibrils seen in intensity without a\nlateral substructure. Additionally, we study one example of exceptional\nbrightness in more detail. It belongs to a different class of structures\nwithout prominent mass flows and with a 3D topology formed by two parallel,\nclosed loops connecting patches of opposite polarity. We present evidence that\nthe inverse Evershed flow into the sunspot in the lower chromosphere is the\nconsequence of siphon flows along short loops that connect photospheric foot\npoints. The dark-cored structure of the chromospheric fibrils cannot have an\nconvective origin because of their location above regular granulation in an\noptically thin atmosphere. The dark core most likely results from an opacity\ndifference between the central axis and the lateral edges caused by the\nsignificant flow speed along the fibrils.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 2014 23:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Surprisingly, our formulation is a simple variation of the DSP.\nSpecifically, we define the triangle densest subgraph problem (TDSP): given\n$G(V,E)$, find a subset of vertices $S^*$ such that $\\tau(S^*)=\\max_{S\n\\subseteq V} \\frac{t(S)}{|S|}$, where $t(S)$ is the number of triangles induced\nby the set $S$. We provide various exact and approximation algorithms which the\nsolve the TDSP efficiently.

Adaptive optics imaging and modeling of the Kepler pixel response\nfunction for a subset of our sample support the conclusion that the targets\nwith multiple periods are highly likely to be relatively young physical binary,\ntriple, and even quadruple M star systems.

The method has a negligible\nperformance loss compared to IHT under Gaussian noise, but superior performance\nunder heavy-tailed non-Gaussian noise conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 04:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

We consider Vapnik's General Setting of\nLearning in which the learning process is defined to be the act of selecting a\nhypothesis in response to a given training set. Such hypothesis can, for\nexample, be a decision boundary in classification, a set of centroids in\nclustering, or a set of frequent item-sets in association rule mining.\nDepending on the hypothesis space and how the final hypothesis is selected, we\nshow that a learning process can be assigned a numeric score, called learning\ncapacity, which is analogous to Shannon's channel capacity and satisfies\nsimilar interesting properties as well such as the data-processing inequality\nand the information-cannot-hurt inequality. In addition, learning capacity\nprovides the tightest possible bound on the difference between true risk and\nempirical risk of the learning process for all loss functions that are\nparametrized by the chosen hypothesis. It is also shown that the notion of\nlearning capacity equivalently quantifies how sensitive the choice of the final\nhypothesis is to a small perturbation in the training set. Consequently,\nalgorithmic stability is both necessary and sufficient for generalization.\nWhile the theory does not rely on concentration inequalities, we finally show\nthat analogs to classical results in learning theory using the Probably\nApproximately Correct (PAC) model can be immediately deduced using this theory,\nand conclude with information-theoretic bounds to learning capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 06:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

Optim., 49 (2011), 381-396], where the\nperturbation contains a weak $\\tau$-function. In this paper, we give a revised\nversion of the pre-order principle. This revised version not only implies the\noriginal pre-order principle, but also can be applied to obtain the above Khanh\nand Quy's EVP. Thus, the revised pre-order principle implies all the known\nset-valued EVPs in set containing forms (to my knowledge).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 07:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

Returning to classical, that is, non quantum mechanical,\ndescriptions will be forever impossible, unless one accepts some extremely\ncontrived theoretical constructions that may or may not reproduce the quantum\nmechanical phenomena observed in experiments.\n  Dissatisfied, this author investigated how one can look at things\ndifferently. This book is an overview of older material, but also contains many\nnew observations and calculations. Quantum mechanics is looked upon as a tool,\nnot as a theory. Examples are displayed of models that are classical in\nessence, but can be analysed by the use of quantum techniques, and we argue\nthat even the Standard Model, together with gravitational interactions, might\nbe viewed as a quantum mechanical approach to analyse a system that could be\nclassical at its core. We explain how such thoughts can conceivably be\nreconciled with Bell's theorem, and how the usual objections voiced against the\nnotion of `superdeterminism' can be overcome, at least in principle. Our\nproposal would eradicate the collapse problem and the measurement problem. Even\nthe existence of an \"arrow of time\" can perhaps be explained in a more elegant\nway than usual.\n  Discussions added in v3: the role of the gravitational force, a mathematical\nphysics definition of free will, and an unconventional view on the arrow of\ntime, amongst others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 09:46:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 11:40:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2015 15:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-22"}

More generally, we introduce the joint reduction\nlattice and study the vanishing of $M^1_{r,s}(a,b)$ for any $r, s \\geq 0$. This\ngives a characterization for a vector $(r,s)$ to be in the joint reduction\nlattice of $I$ and $J$. We also give a cohomological interpretation of these\ntheorems by investigating the local cohomology modules of the bigraded extended\nRees algebra.

The power law\nfall of different QTF are in conformity with third law of thermodynamics. But,\nthe sensitiveness of decay i.e. the power of the power law decay explicitly\ndepends on $\\mu(\\omega)$. We also separately discuss the influence of\nconfinement and magnetic field on the low temperature behavior of different\nQTF. In this process we demonstrate how to control low temperature behaviour of\nanomalous dissipative quantum systems by varying confining length $a$, $B$ and\nthe temperature $T$.

We study a modified concept of\n`universality' at the critical line: roughly speaking, we add a scaling factor\nto the vertical shifts that appear in Voronin's universality theorem.\n  Levinson showed that almost all a-points of the Riemann zeta-function lie in\na certain funnel-shaped region around the critical line. We rely on arguments\nof the theory of normal families and the notion of filling discs to detect\na-points in this region which are very close to the critical line.\n  According to a folklore conjecture (often attributed to Ramachandra) one\nexpects that the values of the Riemann zeta-function on the critical line lie\ndense in the complex numbers. We show that there are certain curves which\napproach the critical line asymptotically such that the values of the\nzeta-function on these curves are dense in the complex numbers.\n  The Lindel\\\"of hypothesis can be reformulated in terms of power moments to\nthe right of the critical line. Tanaka showed recently that the expected\nasymptotic formulas for these power moments are true in a certain\nmeasure-theoretical sense.

As a consequence of the skew scattering, a\nfinite density of skyrmions will generate a topological magnon Hall effect.\nUsing the conservation law for the energy-momentum tensor, we demonstrate that\nthe magnons also transfer momentum to the skyrmion. As a consequence, a magnon\ncurrent leads to magnon pressure reflected in a momentum-transfer force in the\nThiele equation of motion for the skyrmion. This force is reactive and governed\nby the scattering cross sections of the skyrmion; it causes not only a finite\nskyrmion velocity but also a large skyrmion Hall effect. Our results provide,\nin particular, the basis for a theory of skyrmion caloritronics for a dilute\nskyrmion gas in clean insulating chiral magnets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 10:53:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 May 2014 15:42:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 13:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-12"}

Here we consider the\ngravitational wave energy flux at infinity from a point particle in a circular\norbit around a Schwarzschild black hole, which is known to 22PN beyond the\nlowest-order Newtonian prediction, at which point each order has over 1000\nterms. We introduce a factorization that considerably simplifies the spherical\nharmonic modes of the energy flux (and thus also the amplitudes of the\nspherical harmonic modes of the gravitational waves); it is likely that much of\nthe complexity this factorization removes is due to curved-space wave\npropagation (e.g., tail effects). For the modes with azimuthal number l of 7 or\ngreater, this factorization reduces the expressions for the modes that enter\nthe 22PN total energy flux to pure integer PN series with rational\ncoefficients, which amounts to a reduction of up to a factor of ~150 in the\ntotal number of terms in a given mode. The reduction in complexity becomes less\ndramatic for smaller l, due to the structure of the expansion, though the\nfactorization is still able to remove all the half-integer PN terms. For the\n22PN l = 2 modes, this factorization still reduces the total number of terms\n(and size) by a factor of ~10 and gives purely rational coefficients through\n8PN. This factorization also improves the convergence of the series, though we\nfind the exponential resummation introduced for the full energy flux by Isoyama\net al. to be even more effective at improving the convergence of the individual\nmodes, producing improvements of over four orders of magnitude over the\noriginal series for some modes. However, the exponential resummation is not as\neffective at simplifying the series, particularly for the higher-order modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 11:22:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 12:20:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-30"}

It is shown that these relations have a completely different form\nfor Darboux transformations (DTs) keeping the potential within the LC range.\n  As an illustration, we use regular nodeless Frobenius solutions to construct\nSUSY partners of the radial r- and c-Gauss-reference (GRef) potentials solvable\nvia hypergeometric and confluent hypergeometric functions, respectively. We\nexplicitly demonstrate existence of non-isospectral partners of both radial\npotentials in the LC region and obtain their discrete energy spectra using the\nderived closed-form expressions for the TWF functions. The general\ntransformation relations for the TWF function have been verified taking\nadvantage of form-invariance of the radial GRef potentials under double-step\nDTs with the so-called 'basic' seed solutions (SSs). Similarly we directly\nratify that TWF functions for three shape-invariant reflective potentials on\nthe half-line -- hyperbolic Poschl-Teller (h-PT), Eckart/Manning-Rosen (E/MR),\nand centrifugal KC potentials - do retain their form under basic DTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 13:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-09"}

To isolate the object from untidy backgrounds or other surrounding\nobjects in the camera vision, we initially propose an efficient and effective\nmotion based method to define a region of interest (ROI) in the video by asking\nthe user to tremble the object. This scheme extracts moving object region by a\nmixture-of-Gaussians-based background subtraction technique. In the extracted\nROI, text localization and recognition are conducted to acquire text details.\nTo automatically focus the text regions from the object ROI, we offer a novel\ntext localization algorithm by learning gradient features of stroke\norientations and distributions of edge pixels in an Adaboost model. Text\ncharacters in the localized text regions are then binarized and recognized by\noff-the-shelf optical character identification software. The renowned text\ncodes are converted into audio output to the blind users. Performance of the\nsuggested text localization algorithm is quantitatively evaluated on ICDAR-2003\nand ICDAR-2011 Robust Reading Datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour algorithm achieves the highest level of developments at present time. The\nproof-of-concept example is also evaluated on a dataset collected using ten\nblind persons to evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme. We explore the user\ninterface issues and robustness of the algorithm in extracting and reading text\nfrom different objects with complex backgrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 11:32:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-18"}
