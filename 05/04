New optical and near-IR spectra taken\nduring the current high state of V1180 Cas are presented, in conjunction with\nH2 narrow-band imaging of the source. Observed near-IR colour variations are\nanalogous to those observed in EXors and consistent with excess emission\noriginating from an accretion event. The spectra show numerous emission lines,\nwhich indicates accretion, ejection of matter, and an active disc. Using\noptical and near-IR emission features we derive a mass accretion rate of ~3 E-8\nMsun/yr, which is an order of magnitude lower than previous estimates. In\naddition, a mass loss rate of ~4 E-9 and ~4 E-10 Msun/yr are estimated from\natomic forbidden lines and H2, respectively.

Our model couples hydrodynamic simulations\nof a supernova remnant with a kinetic treatment of particle acceleration. We\ninclude two important back-reaction loops upstream of the shock: energetic\nparticles can (i) modify the flow structure and (ii) amplify the magnetic\nfield. As the latter process is not fully understood, we use different limit\ncases that encompass a wide range of possibilities.

We overcome this obstacle by introducing a\nnew quantity, namely the time-since-last-service (TSLS), which tracks the time\nsince the last service. By combining it with the queue-length in the weight, we\npropose a novel maximum-weight type scheduling policy, called Regular Service\nGuarantee (RSG) Algorithm.

The system model matrix which describes the\nrelationship between image space and projection space is important to the image\nquality. It contains some factors such as geometrical component and blurring\ncomponent. The blurring component is usually described by point spread function\n(PSF). A PSF matrix derived from the single photon incidence response function\nis studied. And then an IR method based on the system matrix containing the PSF\nis developed. More specifically, the gamma photon incidence on a crystal array\nis simulated by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, and then the single photon\nincidence response functions are calculated. Subsequently, the single photon\nincidence response functions is used to compute the coincidence blurring factor\naccording to the physical process of PET coincidence detection. Through\nweighting the ordinary system matrix response by the coincidence blurring\nfactors, the IR system matrix containing PSF is finally established. Using this\nsystem matrix, the image is reconstructed by ordered subset expectation\nmaximization (OSEM) algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed\nsystem matrix can obviously improve the image radial resolution, contrast and\nnoise property. Furthermore, the simulated single gamma-ray incidence response\nfunction only depends on the crystal configuration, so the method could be\nextended to any PET scanners with the same detector crystal configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 May 2014 07:10:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 10:08:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2014 10:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-12"}

A sparse noise covariance matrix is a common model for a sparse array\nof sensors consisted of several widely separated subarrays. Since interelement\nspacing among sensors in a subarray is small, the noise in the subarray is in\ngeneral spatially correlated, while, due to large distances between subarrays,\nthe noise between them is uncorrelated. Consequently, the noise covariance\nmatrix of such an array has a block diagonal structure which is indeed sparse.\nMoreover, in an ordinary nonsparse array, because of small distance between\nadjacent sensors, there is noise coupling between neighboring sensors, whereas\none can assume that nonadjacent sensors have spatially uncorrelated noise which\nmakes again the array noise covariance matrix sparse. Utilizing some recently\navailable tools in low-rank/sparse matrix decomposition, matrix completion, and\nsparse representation, we propose a novel method which can resolve possibly\ncorrelated or even coherent sources in the aforementioned partly correlated\nnoise. In particular, when the sources are uncorrelated, our approach involves\nsolving a second-order cone programming (SOCP), and if they are correlated or\ncoherent, one needs to solve a computationally harder convex program.

The main reason is that the\nmagnetic braking mechanisms are generally thought not to work for donor stars\nwith a mass of greater than 1.5 $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ in the canonical model.\nHowever, some intermediate-mass stars have anomalously strong magnetic fields\n(about 100 -- 10000 G), i. e. so-called Ap or Bp stars. With the coupling\nbetween the magnetic field and the irradiation-driven wind from the surface of\nAp/Bp stars, a plausible magnetic braking mechanism should be expected. In this\nwork, we attempt to investigate if IMXBs with Ap/Bp stars can produce IMBPs\nwith a short orbital period (less than 3 d) by such an anomalous magnetic\nbraking mechanism. Using a stellar evolution code, we have simulated the\nevolution of a large number of IMXBs consisting of a NS and an Ap/Bp star. For\nthe spin evolution of the NS, we consider the accretion torque, the propeller\ntorque, and the spin-down torque caused by the interaction between the magnetic\nfield and the accretion disc. The calculated results show that, employing\nanomalous magnetic braking of Ap/Bp stars, IMXBs can evolve into compact IMBPs\nwith short orbital periods of less than 3 d. However, there exists significant\ndiscrepancy between the spin periods of IMBPs in our simulated results and\nthose observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 May 2014 12:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We restrict our attention to modeling observations made near solar\ndisk center, where the line-of-sight velocity is nearly vertical and hence,\nonly the longitudinal component of the motion within the fibril contributes.\nTherefore, we only consider the excitation of axisymmetric sausage waves and\nignore kink oscillations as their motions are primarily horizontal. We compare\nthe vertical motion within the fibril with the vertical motion of the incident\n$p$ mode by constructing the ratio of their powers. In agreement with\nobservational measurements we find that the total power is suppressed within\nstrong magnetic elements for frequencies below the acoustic cut-off frequency.\nWe also find that the magnitude of the power deficit increases with the height\nabove the photosphere at which the measurement is made.

A powerful tool to manage the matrix exponential function is to\nresort to a suitable rational approximation such as the Carath$\\acute{\\rm\ne}$odory-Fej$\\acute{\\rm e}$r approximation, whose core reduces to solve shifted\nlinear systems with multiple right-hand sides. The restarted and shifted block\nFOM algorithm is a commonly used technique for this problem. However,\ndetermining good preconditioners for shifted systems that preserve the original\nstructure is a difficult task. In this paper, we propose a new preconditioner\nfor the restarted and shifted block FOM algorithm. The key is that the absolute\nvalues of the poles of the Carath$\\acute{\\rm e}$odory-Fej$\\acute{\\rm e}$r\napproximation are medium sized and can be much smaller than the norm of the\nmatrix in question. The advantages of the proposed strategy are that we can\nprecondition all the shifted linear systems simultaneously, and preserve the\noriginal structure of the shifted linear systems after restarting. Theoretical\nresults are provided to show the rationality of our preconditioning strategy.\nApplications of the new approach to Toeplitz matrix exponential problem are\nalso discussed.

The spectral characteristics, such as the\npeak flux, duration, and bandwidth, of the individual burst elements were\nsatisfactorily detected by the highly resolved spectral data of AMATEAS with\nthe burst detection algorithm that is improved in this study. The peak flux of\nthe type-I bursts followed a power-law distribution with a spectral index of\n2.9-3.3, whereas their duration and bandwidth were distributed more\nexponentially. There were almost no correlations between the peak flux,\nduration, and bandwidth. That means there were no similarity shapes in the\nburst spectral structures. We defined the growth rate of a burst as the ratio\nbetween its peak flux and duration. There was a strong correlation between the\ngrowth rate and peak flux.

The variation of\nthe time scale of the growth rate is significantly larger than that of the\ncoronal environments.
