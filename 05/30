The running time of the algorithm on a\ncomplete directed graph on $n$ vertices with independent exponential edge\nweights is $O(n)$, with very high probability. This improves on the previously\nbest result of $O(n\\log n)$, which is best possible if only forward scans are\nallowed, exhibiting an interesting separation between forward-only and\nforward-backward SSSP algorithms. As a consequence, we also get a new all-pairs\nshortest paths algorithm. The expected running time of the algorithm on\ncomplete graphs with independent exponential edge weights is $O(n^2)$, matching\na recent algorithm of Demetrescu and Italiano as analyzed by Peres et al.\nFurthermore, the probability that the new algorithm requires more than $O(n^2)$\ntime is exponentially small, improving on the $O(n^{-1/26})$ probability bound\nobtained by Peres et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 17:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-30"}

Our study is based on classical\nsecular theory, using a vectorial approach developed in a separate paper. When\nplanet-planet perturbations are truncated at the second order in eccentricity\nand mutual inclination, and the planet-companion perturbations are developed at\nthe quadrupole order, the problem becomes integrable. The motion is composed of\na uniform precession of the whole system around the total angular momentum, and\nin the rotating frame, the evolution is periodic. Here, we focus on the\nrelative motion associated to the oscillations of the inclination between the\nplanet system and the outer orbit, and of the obliquities of the star with\nrespect to the two orbital planes. The solution is obtained using a powerful\ngeometric method. With this technique, we identify four different regimes\ncharacterized by the nutation amplitude of the stellar spin-axis relative to\nthe orbital plane of the planets. In particular, the obliquity of the star\nreaches its maximum when the system is in the Cassini regime where planets have\nmore angular momentum than the star, and where the precession rate of the star\nis similar to that of the planets induced by the companion. In that case,\nspin-orbit oscillations exceed twice the inclination between the planets and\nthe companion.

Our results provide insights into the factors\nthat determine the stability of multimode states in these systems, and they can\ninform the development of semiconductor mode-locked lasers with tailored\nspectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 18:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

For Gaussian systems, such as a chain of harmonic\noscillators connected at each end to a heat bath, and for anharmonic\noscillators under specified conditions, definitive answers exist in the form of\nproven theorems. Answering this question for quantum many-body systems poses a\nchallenge for the present. In this work we address this issue by deriving the\nstochastic equations for the reduced system with self-consistent backaction\nfrom the two baths, calculating the energy flow from one bath to the chain to\nthe other bath, and exhibiting a power balance relation in the total (chain +\nbaths) system which testifies to the existence of a NESS in this system at late\ntimes. Its insensitivity to the initial conditions of the chain corroborates to\nits uniqueness. The functional method we adopt here entails the use of the\ninfluence functional, the coarse-grained and stochastic effective actions, from\nwhich one can derive the stochastic equations and calculate the average values\nof physical variables in open quantum systems. This involves both taking the\nexpectation values of quantum operators of the system and the distributional\naverages of stochastic variables stemming from the coarse-grained environment.\nThis method though formal in appearance is compact and complete. It can also\neasily accommodate perturbative techniques and diagrammatic methods from field\ntheory. Taken all together it provides a solid platform for carrying out\nsystematic investigations into the nonequilibrium dynamics of open quantum\nsystems and quantum thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 18:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Jun 2014 12:21:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

We explore the outer Galactic disc up to a Galactocentric distance of\n30 kpc to derive its parameters and measure the magnitude of its flare.\n  Methods. We obtained the 3D density of stars of type F8V-G5V with a colour\nselection from extinction-corrected photometric data of the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey - Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration\n(SDSS-SEGUE) over 1,400 deg^2 in off-plane low Galactic latitude regions and\nfitted it to a model of flared thin+thick disc.\n  Results. The best-fit parameters are a thin-disc scale length of 2.0 kpc, a\nthin-disc scale height at solar Galactocentric distance of 0.24 kpc, a\nthick-disc scale length of 2.5 kpc, and a thick-disc scale height at solar\nGalactocentric distance of 0.71 kpc. We derive a flaring in both discs that\ncauses the scale height of the average disc to be multiplied with respect to\nthe solar neighbourhood value by a factor of 3.3^{+2.2}_{-1.6} at R=15 kpc and\nby a factor of 12^{+20}_{-7} at R=25 kpc.\n  Conclusions. The flare is quite prominent at large R and its presence\nexplains the apparent depletion of in-plane stars that are often confused with\na cut-off at R>15 kpc. Indeed, our Galactic disc does not present a truncation\nor abrupt fall-off there, but the stars are spread in off-plane regions, even\nat z of several kpc for R>20 kpc. Moreover, the smoothness of the observed\nstellar distribution also suggests that there is a continuous structure and not\na combination of a Galactic disc plus some other substructure or extragalactic\ncomponent: the hypothesis to interpret the Monoceros ring in terms of a tidal\nstream of a putative accreted dwarf galaxy is not only unnecessary because the\nobserved flare explains the overdensity in the Monoceros ring observed in SDSS\nfields, but it appears to be inappropriate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 18:43:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

Here $B_{0}$ is a positive universal constant, $n$ is\nalso a constant and $V$ is the volume of the fluid. From the consideration of\nthermodynamic stability, it is seen that only if the values of $n$ are allowed\nto be negative, then $(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V})_{S} <0$ throughout the\nevolution. Again thermal capacity at constant volume $c_{V}$ shows positive\nexpression. Using the best fit value of $ n = -3.4$ as previously found by Guo\n\\emph{et al} \\cite{guo1} gives that the fluid is thermodynamically stable\nthrough out the evolution. The effective equation of state for the special case\nof, $n = 0$ goes to $\\Lambda$CDM model. Again for $n <0$ it favours\nphantom-like cosmology which is in agreement with the current SNe Ia\nconstraints like VCG model. The deceleration parameter is also studied in the\ncontext of thermodynamics and the analysis shows that the \\emph{flip} occurs\nfor the value of $ n < 4$.

As expected the volume\nincreases as temperature falls during adiabatic expansions.

By\nassuming a fiducial GRB spectrum and a power-law proton distribution extending\nto ultra-high energies, we calculate the proton cooling rate and the neutrino\nemission produced through photopion processes. For this, we employ a numerical\ncode that follows the formation of the hadronic cascade by taking into account\nnon-linear feedback effects, such as the evolution of the target photon field\nitself due to the contribution of secondary particles. We show that in cases of\nefficient proton cooling and subsequently efficient high-energy neutrino\nproduction, the emission from the hadronic cascade distorts and may even\ndominate the GRB spectrum. Taking this into account, we constrain the allowable\nvalues of the ratio $\\eta_p=L_p/L_{\\gamma}$, where $L_{p}$ and $L_{\\gamma}$ are\nthe isotropic equivalent proton and prompt gamma-ray luminosities. For the\nhighest value of $\\eta_{p}$ that does not lead to the dominance of the\ncascading emission, we then calculate the maximum neutrino luminosity from a\nsingle burst and show that it ranges between $(0.01- 0.6)L_{p}$ and\n$(0.5-1.4)L_{\\gamma}$ for various parameter sets. We discuss possible\nimplications of other parameters, such as the magnetic field strength and the\nshape of the initial gamma-ray spectrum, on our results. Finally, we compare\nthe upper limit on $\\eta_p$ derived here with various studies in the field, and\nwe point out the necessity of a self-consistent treatment of the hadronic\nemission in order to avoid erroneously high neutrino fluxes from GRB models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 19:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

For this reason, it is impossible to formulate SPTs under\nGinzburg-Landau theory or probe SPTs via fractionalized bulk excitations and\ntopology-dependent ground state degeneracy. However, the partition functions\nfrom path integrals with various symmetry twists are the universal SPT\ninvariants defining topological probe responses, fully characterizing SPTs. In\nthis work, we use gauge fields to represent those symmetry twists in closed\nspacetimes of any dimensionality and arbitrary topology. This allows us to\nexpress the SPT invariants in terms of continuum field theory. We show that SPT\ninvariants of pure gauge actions describe the SPTs predicted by group\ncohomology, while the mixed gauge-gravity actions describe the\nbeyond-group-cohomology SPTs, recently observed by Kapustin. We find new\nexamples of mixed gauge-gravity actions for U(1) SPTs in 4+1D via mixing the\ngauge first Chern class with a gravitational Chern-Simons term, or viewed as a\n5+1D Wess-Zumino-Witten term with a Pontryagin class.

We investigate jointly several constraints on the\ndistance scale r and Lorentz factor Gamma of the gamma-ray emitting regions in\nluminous blazars (primarily flat spectrum radio quasars, FSRQs). Working in the\nframework of one-zone external radiation Comptonization (ERC) models, we\nperform a parameter space study for several representative cases of actual\ngamma-ray flares in their multiwavelength context. We find a particularly\nuseful combination of three constraints: from an upper limit on the collimation\nparameter Gamma*theta <~ 1, from an upper limit on the synchrotron self-Compton\n(SSC) luminosity L_SSC <~ L_X, and from an upper limit on the efficient cooling\nphoton energy E_cool,obs <~ 100 MeV. These three constraints are particularly\nstrong for sources with low accretion disk luminosity L_d. The commonly used\nintrinsic pair-production opacity constraint on Gamma is usually much weaker\nthan the SSC constraint. The SSC and cooling constraints provide a robust lower\nlimit on the collimation parameter Gamma*theta >~ 0.1 - 0.7. Typical values of\nr corresponding to moderate values of Gamma ~ 20 are in the range 0.1 - 1 pc,\nand are determined primarily by the observed variability time scale t_var,obs.\nAlternative scenarios motivated by the observed gamma-ray/mm connection, in\nwhich gamma-ray flares of t_var,obs ~ a few days are located at r ~ 10 pc, are\nin conflict with both the SSC and cooling constraints. Moreover, we use a\nsimple light travel time argument to point out that the gamma-ray/mm connection\ndoes not provide a significant constraint on the location of gamma-ray flares.\nWe argue that spine-sheath models of the jet structure do not offer a plausible\nalternative to external radiation fields at large distances, however, an\nextended broad-line region is an idea worth exploring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In\nthis work, we consider example compactness priors such as sparsity in temporal\nFourier domain, sparsity in temporal finite difference domain, and nuclear norm\npenalty to exploit low rank structure. Using variable splitting, we decouple\nthe complex optimization problem to simpler and well understood sub problems;\nthe resulting algorithm alternates between simple steps of shrinkage based\ndenoising, deformable registration, and a quadratic optimization step.\nAdditionally, we employ efficient continuation strategies to minimize the risk\nof convergence to local minima. The proposed formulation contrasts with\nexisting DC-CS schemes that are customized for free breathing cardiac cine\napplications, and other schemes that rely on fully sampled reference frames or\nnavigator signals to estimate the deformation parameters. The efficient\ndecoupling enabled by the proposed scheme allows its application to a wide\nrange of applications including contrast enhanced dynamic MRI. Through\nexperiments on numerical phantom and in vivo myocardial perfusion MRI datasets,\nwe demonstrate the utility of the proposed DC-CS scheme in providing robust\nreconstructions with reduced motion artifacts over classical compressed sensing\nschemes that utilize the compact priors on the original deformation\nun-corrected signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 20:36:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 23:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-04"}

Underlying theories, such as\nstring/M-theories compactified to four dimensions, could predict the phases and\nthus EDMs in the resulting supersymmetric (SUSY) theory. Earlier one of us,\nwith collaborators, made such a prediction and found, unexpectedly, that the\nphases were predicted to be zero at tree level in the theory at the unification\nor string scale $\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{16}$ GeV). Electroweak (EW) scale EDMs\nstill arise via running from the high scale, and depend only on the SM Yukawa\ncouplings that also give the CKM phase. Here we extend the earlier work by\nstudying the dependence of the low scale EDMs on the constrained but not fully\nknown fundamental Yukawa couplings. The dominant contribution is from two loop\ndiagrams and is not sensitive to the choice of Yukawa texture. The electron EDM\nshould not be found to be larger than about $ 5\\times 10^{-30} e$ cm, and the\nneutron EDM should not be larger than about $5\\times 10^{-29}e$ cm. These\nvalues are quite a bit smaller than the reported predictions from Split SUSY\nand typical effective theories, but much larger than the Standard Model\nprediction. Also, since models with random phases typically give much larger\nEDMs, it is a significant testable prediction of compactified M-theory that the\nEDMs should not be above these upper limits. The actual EDMs can be below the\nlimits, so once they are measured they could provide new insight into the\nfundamental Yukawa couplings of leptons and quarks. We comment also on the role\nof strong CP violation. EDMs probe fundamental physics near the Planck scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 20:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-02"}

The Warm\nBreeze is approximately two-fold slower and 2.5 times warmer than the primary\ninterstellar He population, and its density in front of the heliosphere is ~7%\nthat of the neutral interstellar helium.

One of the most\nimportant conditions for obtaining favourable and steady results is the\n\"immersing\" of the subject as long as possible into therapeutic context: at\nhome, at school/work, on the street. Since nowadays portable computers tend to\nbecome habitual accessories, it seems a good idea to create virtual versions of\nhuman SLTs and to integrate them into these devices. However one of the main\ndistinctions between a Speech and Language Therapist (SLT) and a Computer Based\nSpeech Therapy System (CBST) arise from the field of emotion intelligence. The\ninability of current CBSTs to detect emotional state of human subjects leads to\ninadequate behavioural responses. Furthermore, this \"unresponsive\" behaviour is\nperceived as a lack of empathy and, especially when subjects are children,\nleads to negative emotional state such as frustration. Thus in this article we\npropose an original emotions recognition framework - named PhonEM - to be\nintegrated in our previous developed CBST - Logomon.

For an inter-clump density set to 1 % of\nthe mean density, we for O and B supergiants derive upward empirical mass-loss\ncorrections of typically factors of either ~5 or ~50, depending on which of the\ntwo applicable solutions is chosen. Overall, our results indicate this solution\ndichotomy severely limits the use of UV resonance lines as direct mass-loss\nindicators of clumped hot stellar winds. We next apply the effective-opacity\nformalism to the standard CAK theory of line-driven winds. By analytic and\nnumerical hydrodynamics calculations, we show that in cases where vorosity is\nimportant at the critical point setting the mass-loss rate, the reduced\nline-force leads to a lower theoretical mass loss, by a factor scaling with the\nnormalized velocity filling factor fvel. On the other hand, if vorosity is\nimportant only above this critical point, the predicted mass loss is not\naffected, but the wind terminal speed is reduced. This shows that porosity in\nvelocity space can have a significant impact not only on the diagnostics, but\nalso on the dynamics and theory of radiatively driven winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2014 09:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The underlying\nmechanism is a coherent dipole-dipole coupling between particles, as already\nrecognized in the early days of quantum mechanics, but this coherence was not\ndirectly observed so far. Here, we study, both spectroscopically and in the\ntime domain, the coherent, dipolar-induced exchange of electronic excitations\nbetween two single Rydberg atoms separated by a controlled distance as large as\n15 microns, and brought into resonance by applying a small electric field. The\ncoherent oscillation of the system between two degenerate pair states occurs at\na frequency that scales as the inverse third power of the distance, the\nhallmark of dipole-dipole interactions.

In\nparticular, the role of feedback and magnetic field are still partially\nunderstood. We investigate the role played by supernovae feedback and magnetic\nfield onto the star formation and the structure of the Galactic disk. We\nperform numerical simulations of the turbulent, magnetized, self-gravitating,\nmulti-phase, supernovae regulated ISM within a 1 kpc stratified box. We\nimplemented various schemes for the supernovae. This goes from a random\ndistribution at a fixed rate to distributions for which the supernovae are\nspatially and temporally correlated to the formation of stars. To study the\ninfluence of magnetic field on star formation, we perform both hydrodynamical\nand magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. We find that supernovae feedback has a\ndrastic influence on the galactic evolution. The supernovae distribution is\nplaying a very significant role. When the supernovae are not correlated with\nstar formation events, they do not modify significantly the very high star\nformation rate obtained without feedback. When the supernovae follow the\naccretion, the star formation rate can be reduced by a factor up to 30.\nMagnetic field is also playing a significant role. It reduces the star\nformation rate by a factor up to 2-3 and reduces the number of collapse sites\nby a factor of about 2. The exact correlation between the supernovae and the\ndense gas appears to have significant consequences on the galactic disk\nevolution and the star formation. This implies that small scale studies are\nnecessary to understand and quantify the feedback efficiency. Magnetic field\ndoes influence the star formation at galactic scales by reducing the star\nformation rate and the number of star formation sites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 May 2014 10:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

It is important to understand how the mechanical\nsignals transmit from the artificial skin to the embedded tactile sensors. In\nthis paper, we made use of a finite element model of an artificial fingertip\nwith viscoelastic and hyperelastic behaviors to investigate the subsurface\npressure profiles when flat, curved, and Braille surfaces were indented on the\nsurface of the model. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of 1, 3 and 5 mm\nthickness of the skin on the subsurface pressure profiles. The simulation\nresults were experimentally validated using a 25.4 {\\mu}m thin pressure\ndetecting film that was able to follow the contours of a non-planar surface,\nwhich is analogous to an artificial bone. Results show that the thickness of\nthe artificial skin has an effect on the peak pressure, on the span of the\npressure distribution, and on the overall shape of the pressure profile that\nwas encoded on a curved subsurface structure.

We derive the expectation value of the shift using\nsecond-order perturbations about a concordance background, and show that the\ndistance to last scattering is increased by 1%.
