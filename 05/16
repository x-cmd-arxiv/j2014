Bright points (BPs) are small-scale, magnetic features ubiquitous\nacross the solar surface. Previously, we have observed and noted their\nproperties for quiet Sun regions. Here, we determine the dynamic properties of\nBPs using simultaneous quiet Sun and active region data. Methods. High spatial\nand temporal resolution G-band observations of active region AR11372 were\nobtained with the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere instrument at the\nDunn Solar Telescope. Three subfields of varying polarity and magnetic flux\ndensity were selected with the aid of magnetograms obtained from the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory.\nBright points within these subfields were subsequently tracked and analysed.\nResults. It is found that BPs within active regions display attenuated velocity\ndistributions with an average horizontal velocity of ~0.6 km/s, compared to the\nquiet region which had an average velocity of 0.9 km/s. Active region BPs are\nalso ~21% larger than quiet region BPs and have longer average lifetimes\n(~132s) than their quiet region counterparts (88 s). No preferential flow\ndirections are observed within the active region subfields. The diffusion index\n(gamma) is estimated at ~1.2 for the three regions. Conclusions. We confirm\nthat the dynamic properties of BPs arise predominately from convective motions.\nThe presence of stronger field strengths within active regions is the likely\nreason behind the varying properties observed. We believe that larger amounts\nof magnetic flux will attenuate BP velocities by a combination of restricting\nmotion within the intergranular lanes and by increasing the number of\nstagnation points produced by inhibited convection. Larger BPs are found in\nregions of higher magnetic flux density and we believe that lifetimes increase\nin active regions as the magnetic flux stabilises the BPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2014 18:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

The\nspace-time and momentum space dynamics, and thus dynamical phase space, is\ngoverned by a new version of the Renormalization Group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2014 19:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Mostly using higher dimensional operators in a\ngauge-invariant framework, we show that substantial information on anomalous\ncouplings can be extracted from the total rates of $s$-and $t$-channel Higgs\nproduction. The most obvious kinematic distributions, based on angular\ndependence of matrix elements, are relatively less sensitive with moderate\ncoefficients of anomalous couplings, unless one goes to higher centre-of-mass\nenergies. Some important quantities to use here, apart from the total event\nrates, are the ratios of event rates at different energies, ratios of $s$ and\n$t$-channel rates at fixed energies, and under some fortunate circumstances,\nthe correlated changes in the rates for $W$-boson pair-production.

Negative feedback in\ngene expression plays a critical role in buffering intracellular fluctuations\nin protein concentrations around optimal value. Due to the nonlinearities\npresent in these feedbacks, moment dynamics are typically not closed, in the\nsense that the time derivative of the lower-order statistical moments of the\nprotein copy number depends on high-order moments. Moment equations are closed\nby expressing higher-order moments as nonlinear functions of lower-order\nmoments, a technique commonly referred to as moment closure. Here, we compare\nthe performance of different moment closure techniques. Our results show that\nthe commonly used closure method, which assumes a priori that the protein\npopulation counts are normally distributed, performs poorly. In contrast,\nconditional derivative matching, a novel closure scheme proposed here provides\na good approximation to the exact moments across different parameter regimes.\nIn summary our study provides a new moment closure method for studying\nstochastic dynamics of genetic negative feedback circuits, and can be extended\nto probe noise in more complex gene networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2014 19:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-16"}

For both the inclusive study and\nthe study requiring a bottom-quark jet, the data are examined in exclusive\nfinal states corresponding to all-hadronic, single-lepton, and dilepton events.\nThe study is based on the data set of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7\nTeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2011, corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 4.7 inverse femtobarns.

Seventeen optical and twenty-three NIR spectra were obtained from 10\ndays before ($-$10d) to 10 days after (+10d) the time of maximum $B$-band\nbrightness. The relative strengths of absorption features and their patterns of\ndevelopment can be compared at one day intervals throughout most of this\nperiod. Carbon is not detected in the optical spectra, but we identify CI\n$\\lambda$ 1.0693 in the NIR spectra. We find that MgII lines with high\noscillator strengths have higher initial velocities than other MgII lines. We\nshow that the velocity differences can be explained by differences in optical\ndepths due to oscillator strengths. The spectra of SN 2014J show it is a normal\nSN Ia, but many parameters are near the boundaries between normal and\nhigh-velocity subclasses. The velocities for OI, MgII, SiII, SII, CaII and FeII\nsuggest that SN 2014J has a layered structure with little or no mixing. That\nresult is consistent with the delayed detonation explosion models.

The eight quasars presented here span a large range of luminosities\n(-27.3 < M_{1450} < -25.4; 19.6 < z_ps1 < 21.2) and are remarkably\nheterogeneous in their spectral features: half of them show bright emission\nlines whereas the other half show a weak or no Ly$\\alpha$ emission line (25%\nwith rest-frame equivalent width of the Ly$\\alpha$ + Nv line lower than\n15{\\AA}). We find a larger fraction of weak-line emission quasars than in lower\nredshift studies. This may imply that the weak-line quasar population at the\nhighest redshifts could be more abundant than previously thought. However,\nlarger samples of quasars are needed to increase the statistical significance\nof this finding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2014 20:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-09"}

This means that both the steady state value of and\nfluctuations in the inner disk's accretion rate, depending on the details of\nthe inner boundary condition and occurring on the inner disk's rapid evolution\ntime, can affect the outer disk. This is particularly interesting because\nobservations have shown that disk accretion is not steady (e.g.~EX Lupi type\nobjects).

A similar formula holds for the range of the\ncorresponding displacement mapping.

To clarify this point, we performed a high-resolution N-body\nsimulation of a cosmological volume 1 Mpc/h comoving on a side, reaching the\nhighest mass resolution to date in this regime. We make precision measurements\nof various physical properties that characterize dark matter haloes (such as\nthe virial ratio, spin parameter, shape, and formation times, etc.) for the\nhigh-redshift (z > 15) dark matter mini-haloes we find in our simulation, and\ncompare them to literature results and a moderate-resolution comparison run\nwithin a cube of side-length 100 Mpc/h. We find that dark matter haloes at\nhigh-redshift have a log-normal distribution of the dimensionless spin\nparameter centered around {\\lambda} $\\sim$ 0.03, similar to their more massive\ncounterparts. They tend to have a small ratio of the length of the shortest\naxis to the longest axis (sphericity), and are highly prolate. In fact, haloes\nof given mass that formed recently are the least spherical, have the highest\nvirial ratios, and have the highest spins. Interestingly, the formation times\nof our mini-halos depend only very weakly on mass, in contrast to more massive\nobjects. This is expected from the slope of the linear power spectrum of\ndensity perturbations at this scale, but despite this difference, dark matter\nstructures at high-redshift share many properties with their much more massive\ncounterparts observed at later times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 May 2014 21:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-19"}

We observed 14 MIPSGAL bubbles\n(MBs), WR149, and 2 objects in the Cyg-X region (WR138a and BD+43 3710), our\nsample being about 2.5 mag fainter in K band than previous studies of the\ncentral sources of MBs. We use spectroscopic diagnostics and spectral libraries\nto constrain the natures of our targets. We find five late type giants. The\nequivalent widths of their CO 2.29um features allow us to determine their\nspectral types and hence derive extinction along the line of sight, distance,\nand physical size of the shells. We also find twelve early type stars, in nine\nMBs and the 3 comparison objects.

In OCKM, multiple\nsub codewords are used to encode the subvector of a data point in a subspace.\nEach sub codeword stems from different sub codebooks in each subspace, which\nare optimally generated with regards to the minimization of the distortion\nerrors. The high-dimensional data point is then encoded as the concatenation of\nthe indices of multiple sub codewords from all the subspaces. This can provide\nmore flexibility and lower distortion errors than traditional methods.\nExperimental results on the standard real-life datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority over state-of-the-art approaches for approximate nearest neighbor\nsearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 03:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-19"}

We show that the addition of a fourth generation with vector-like\nquarks to the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) can raise the\npredicted value of the physical Higgs mass by mixing with the top sector. The\nmixing requires a larger top quark Yukawa coupling (by up to $\\sim 6 %$) to\nproduce the same top mass. Since loop corrections to $m_h$ go as $y_{top}^4$,\nthis will in turn increase the predicted value of the physical Higgs mass, a\npoint not previously emphasized in the literature. In the presence of mixing,\nfor A-terms and soft masses around 900 GeV, a Higgs mass of 125 GeV can be\ngenerated while retaining perturbativity of the gauge couplings, evading\nconstraints from electroweak precision measurements (EWPM) and recent LHC\nsearches, and pushing the Landau pole for the top Yukawa above the GUT scale.\nSoft masses can be as low as 800 GeV in parts of parameter space with a Landau\npole at $\\sim 10^{10}$ GeV. However, the Landau pole can still be pushed above\nthe GUT scale if one sacrifices perturbative unification by adding fields in a\n$\\mathbf{5}$+$\\mathbf{\\bar{5}}$ representation.

The resulting noise can lead to growth of the\nsix-dimensional rms emittance and a suitably defined rms entropy.

The ribosome\nprotection patterns are consistent with the presence of translated open reading\nframes (ORFs) in a very large number of lncRNAs. Most of the ribosome-protected\nORFs are shorter than 100 amino acids and usually cover less than half the\ntranscript. Ribosome density in these ORFs is high and contrasts sharply with\nthe 3UTR region, in which very often there is no detectable ribosome binding,\nsimilar to bona fide protein-coding genes. The coding potential of\nribosome-protected ORFs, measured using hexamer frequencies, is significantly\nhigher than that of randomly selected intronic ORFs and similar to that of\nevolutionary young coding sequences. Selective constraints in\nribosome-protected ORFs from lncRNAs are lower than in typical protein-coding\ngenes but again similar to young proteins. These results strongly suggest that\nlncRNAs play an important role in de novo protein evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 14:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-02"}

Their exact analysis is unfeasible in most cases because of the state\nspace explosion. Approximations are usually sought, often with the goal of\nreducing the number of variables. Among them, the mean field limit and the\nquasi-equilibrium approximations stand out. We view them as techniques that are\nrooted in independent basic principles. At the basis of the mean field limit is\nthe law of large numbers. The principle of the quasi-equilibrium reduction is\nthe separation of temporal scales. It is common practice to apply both limits\nto an MPM yielding a fully reduced model. Although the two limits should be\nviewed as completely independent options, they are applied almost invariably in\na fixed sequence: MF limit first, QE-reduction second. We present a framework\nthat makes explicit the distinction of the two reductions, and allows an\narbitrary order of their application.

This\npaper presents a new approach to estimating the risk of large cascading\nblackouts triggered by multiple contingencies. The method uses a search\nalgorithm (Random Chemistry) to identify blackout-causing contingencies, and\nthen combines the results with outage probabilities to estimate overall risk.\nComparing this approach with Monte Carlo sampling for two test cases (the IEEE\nRTS-96 and a 2383 bus model of the Polish system) illustrates that the new\napproach is at least two orders of magnitude faster than Monte Carlo, without\nintroducing measurable bias.

By computing the sensitivity of risk to\nindividual initial outage probabilities for the Polish system, we found that\nreducing three line-outage probabilities by 50% would reduce cascading failure\nrisk by 33%.

We present a multiwavelength study of the Be/X-ray binary system SAX\nJ2103.5+4545 with the goal of better characterizing the transient behaviour of\nthis source.\n  Methods. SAX J2103.5+4545 was observed by Swift-XRT four times in 2007 from\nApril 25 to May 5, and during quiescence in 2012 August 31. In addition, this\nsource has been monitored from the ground-based astronomical observatories of\nEl Teide (Tenerife, Spain), Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain) and Sierra\nNevada (Granada, Spain) since 2011 August, and from the TUBITAK National\nObservatory (Antalya, Turkey) since 2009 June. We have performed spectral and\nphotometric temporal analyses in order to investigate the different states\nexhibited by SAX J2103.5+4545.\n  Results. In X-rays, an absorbed power law model provided the best fit for all\nthe XRT spectra. An iron-line feature at ~6.42 keV was present in all the\nobservations except for that taken during quiescence in 2012. The photon\nindexes are consistent with previous studies of SAX J2103.5+4545 in high/low\nluminosity states. Pulsations were found in all the XRT data from 2007\n(2.839(2) mHz; MJD 54222.02), but not during quiescence. Both optical outbursts\nin 2010 and 2012 lasted for about 8/9 months (as the one in 2007 probably did\nand the current one in 2014 might do) and were most probably caused by mass\nejection events from the Be star that eventually fed the circumstellar disc.\nAll of these outbursts started about 3 months before the triggering of the\nX-ray activity, and about the same period before the maximum of the H_alpha\nline equivalent width (in emission) was reached at only ~ -5 \\AA. In this work\nwe found that the global correlation between the BV variability and the X-ray\nintensity was also observed at longer wavelengths in the IR domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 15:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

The Lagrangian\ndescribing the scalar field f characterized by \"imaginary mass\" and\nnonlinearity of ${\\phi}^4$ type, existing in the space-time with non-zero\nscalar curvature $R$, is proposed to be augmented with an additional linear\nterm $\\propto R{\\phi}$, along with the standard term $\\propto R|{\\phi}|^2$\nquadratic in ${\\phi}$. The term linear in ${\\phi}$, playing the role of an\n\"external field\", leads to a cubic equation in ${\\phi}$ for the extrema of the\npotential energy of the scalar field and ensures the possibility of a\nfirst-order phase transition driven by the parameter proportional to $R$. It is\nassumed that the early Universe is filled with non-linear scalar field in the\nground state and cold matter, neutral with respect to all charges, satisfying\nthe equation of state $p={\\nu}{\\epsilon}$. It is shown that given the condition\n${\\nu}>1/3$ the scalar curvature $R={\\kappa}(3{\\nu}-1){\\epsilon}-4{\\Lambda}$\n(where ${\\Lambda}$ is the cosmological constant) decreases with diminishing of\nthe energy density of matter during the Universe's expansion and reaches\ncertain critical value $R_c<0$ when the first-order phase transition occurs.\nUsing parameters characterizing the Higgs field, the rapid \"roll-down\" of the\nsystem into the potential minimum is shown to take place in a time span of\nabout $10^{-31}$ s. During this time the latent heat of the transition is\nreleased increasing the temperature of the Universe to the Planck value\n$T_P=10^{32}$ K, which may be seen as the \"Big Bang\" producing $4 \\cdot\n10^{30}$ GW of power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 15:59:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 13:00:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 01:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-26"}
