The Hamiltonian of these systems comprises of the Dirac kinetic energy,\na mass gap term, and the spin-orbit coupling. The second term breaks the\nsub-lattice symmetry of the honey-comb lattice structure and generates a gap.\nThe buckled structure generates a staggered sub-lattice potential between\nsilicon atoms at A sites and B sites for an applied electric field\nperpendicular to its plane. Tuning of the electric field, allows for rich\nbehavior varying from a topological insulator to a band insulator with a valley\nspin-polarized metal at a critical value in between. Thus, the mobile electrons\nin silicene or germanene are coupled differently compared to graphene to an\nexternal electric field. Our preliminary investigation have shown that, as long\nas the non-magnetic impurity scattering strength is moderate, i.e. the strength\nis of the same order as the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling of 4 meV, valley-spin\npolarized metal phase is protected. The effective \"two-component Dirac physics\"\nremains valid in this phase. The increase in the electric field beyond the\ncritical value leads to the valley magnetic moment reversal. The enhancement in\nthe impurity scattering strength, however, leads to the disappearance of the\npolarized metal phase due to accentuated intra- and inter-valley scattering\nprocesses. This disappearance does not occur due to the increase in Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 May 2014 16:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}

A fraction of these stars has been found to\norbit the supermassive black hole, SgrA*, in a projected clockwise disk, which\nsuggests that they were formed in a formerly existing dense disk around SgrA*.\nWe focus on the extended, near-infrared (NIR) sources IRS1W, IRS5, IRS10W, and\nIRS21 that have been suggested to be young, massive stars that form bow-shocks\nthrough their interaction with the ISM. Their nature has impeded accurate\ndetermination of their orbital parameters. We aim at establishing their nature\nand kinematics to test whether they form part of the clockwise disk. We\nperformed NIR multi-wavelength imaging using adaptive optics (AO) and sparse\naperture masking (SAM). We introduce a new method for self-calibration of the\nSAM PSF in dense stellar fields. The emission mechanism, morphology and\nkinematics of the targets were examined via 3D bow-shock models. We confirm\nprevious findings that IRS21, IRS1W, and IRS5 are bow-shocks created by the\ninteraction between mass-losing stars and the interstellar gas. The nature of\nIRS10W remains unclear. Our modeling shows that the bow-shock-emission is\ncaused by thermal emission while the scattering of stellar light does not play\nany significant role. IRS 1W appears to be a bow-shock produced by an\nanisotropic stellar wind or by locally inhomogeneous ISM density. Our best-fit\nmodels provide an estimate of the local proper motion of the ISM in the NA in\nagreement with the published models. Assuming that all of the sources are tied\nto SgrA*, their orbital planes were obtained via a Monte-Carlo simulation.

Among paths of bounded\nvariation with given Signature there is always a unique shortest\nrepresentative. These graduated summaries or features of a path are at the\nheart of the definition of a rough path; locally they remove the need to look\nat the fine structure of the path. Taylor's theorem explains how any smooth\nfunction can, locally, be expressed as a linear combination of certain special\nfunctions (monomials based at that point). Coordinate iterated integrals form a\nmore subtle algebra of features that can describe a stream or path in an\nanalogous way; they allow a definition of rough path and a natural linear\n\"basis\" for functions on streams that can be used for machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 May 2014 18:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}

Several units or data summarization methods for transcript\nquantification have been proposed in the past to account for differences in\ntranscript lengths and sequencing depths across different genes and different\nsamples. Nevertheless, further between-sample normalization is still needed for\nreliable detection of differentially expressed genes. In this paper we propose\na unified statistical model for joint detection of differential gene expression\nand between-sample normalization. Our method is independent of the unit in\nwhich gene expression levels are summarized. We also introduce an efficient\nalgorithm for model fitting.

Working at second order in the dimensionless angular\nmomentum, we compute the mass M, radius R, scalar charge q, moment of inertia I\nand spin-induced quadrupole moment Q, as well as the tidal and rotational Love\nnumbers. Our formalism applies to generic scalar-tensor theories, but we focus\nin particular on theories that allow for spontaneous scalarization. It was\nrecently discovered that the moment of inertia, quadrupole moment and Love\nnumbers are connected by approximately universal (i.e., equation-of-state\nindependent) \"I-Love-Q\" relations. We find that similar relations hold also for\nspontaneously scalarized stars. More interestingly, the I-Love-Q relations in\nscalar-tensor theories coincide with the general relativistic ones within less\nthan a few percent, even for spontaneously scalarized stars with the largest\ncouplings allowed by current binary-pulsar constraints. This implies that\nastrophysical measurements of these parameters cannot be used to discriminate\nbetween general relativity and scalar-tensor theories, even if spontaneous\nscalarization occurs in nature. Because of the well known equivalence between\nf(R) theories and scalar-tensor theories, the theoretical framework developed\nin this paper can be used to construct rotating compact stellar models in f(R)\ngravity.

Spectra show\nstrong absorption features due to water vapor and ozone, which is a\nbiosignature gas. We perform a significant recalibration of the UV-visible\nspectra and provide the first comparison of high-resolution visible Earth\nspectra to the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory\nthree-dimensional spectral Earth model. We find good agreement with the\nobservations, reproducing the absolute brightness and dynamic range at all\nwavelengths for all observation epochs, thus validating the model to within the\n~10% data calibration uncertainty. Data-model comparisons reveal a strong ocean\nglint signature in the crescent phase dataset, which is well matched by our\nmodel predictions throughout the observed wavelength range. This provides the\nfirst observational test of a technique that could be used to determine\nexoplanet habitability from disk-integrated observations at visible and\nnear-infrared wavelengths, where the glint signal is strongest. We examine the\ndetection of the ozone 255 nm Hartley and 400-700 nm Chappuis bands. While the\nHartley band is the strongest ozone feature in Earth's spectrum, false\npositives for its detection could exist.

Our aim here is\nto provide conceptual basis for the development of InHZ models incorporating\nconsistently life-environment interactions. Although previous authors have\nexplored the effects of life on habitability there is a gap in research\ndeveloping the reasons why life should be systematically included at\ndetermining the HZ limits. We do not provide here definitive limits to the InHZ\nbut we show through simple numerical models (as a parable of an inhabited\nplanet) how the limits of the AHZ could be modified by including plausible\ninteractions between biota and its environment. These examples aim also at\nposing the question that if limits of the HZ could be modified by the presence\nof life in those simple dynamical systems how will those limits change if life\nis included in established models of the AHZ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 01:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}

This work\nanalyses the temporal evolution of coronal source heating and the chromospheric\nresponse during this pre-heating phase to investigate the origin and nature of\nearly energy release and transport during a solar flare. Simultaneous X-ray,\nEUV, and microwave observations of a well observed flare with a prolonged\npre-heating phase are analysed to study the time evolution of the thermal\nemission and to determine the onset of particle acceleration. During the 20\nminutes duration of the pre-heating phase we find no hint of accelerated\nelectrons, neither in hard X-rays nor in microwave emission.

The\ninflated discrete beta regression (IDBR) model addresses those four critical\ncharacteristics that have never been taken into account simultaneously by\nexisting models.

We attribute the extremely high value of \\sigma_v to\nthe bimodality in the velocity distribution. We find evidence of a significant\nvelocity gradient and optical 3D substructure. The X-ray analysis also shows\nmany features in favour of a complex cluster structure, probably supporting an\nongoing merger of substructures in Abell 1351. The observational scenario\nagrees with the presence of two main subclusters in the northern region, each\nwith its brightest galaxy (BCG1 and BCG2), detected as the two most important\nX-ray substructures with a rest-frame LOS velocity difference of \\Delta v~2500\nkm/s (in the rest frame) and probably being in large part aligned with the LOS.\nWe conclude that Abell 1351 is a massive merging cluster.

As a classic estimator based on random matrix theory\n(RMT), the RMT estimator estimates the number of signals via sequentially\ntesting the likelihood of an eigenvalue as arising from a signal or noise for a\ngiven over-detection probability. However, it tends to under-estimate the\nnumber of signals as weak signal eigenvalues may be immersed in the\nnon-negligible bias term among eigenvalues for finite sample size. In order to\nsolve this problem, we propose an RMT estimator with adaptive decision\ncriterion (termed as RMT-ADC estimator) by adaptively incorporating the bias\nterm into the decision criterion of the RMT estimator. Firstly, we analyze the\neffect of this bias term among eigenvalues on the estimation performance of the\nRMT estimator. Then, we derive both the decreased over-estimation probability\nand the increased under-estimation probability of the RMT estimator incurred by\nthe bias term when assuming the eigenvalue being tested is arising from a\nsignal, and also derive the increased under-estimation probability of the RMT\nestimator incurred by the bias term when assuming the eigenvalue being tested\nis arising from noise. Based on these results, the RMT-ADC estimator can\nadaptively determine whether the noise variance should be estimated under the\nassumption that the eigenvalue being tested is arising from a signal or from\nnoise, and thus can adaptively select its decision criterion. Moreover, the\nRMT-ADC estimator can adaptively determine whether the bias term among\neigenvalues should be incorporated into the selected decision criterion or not.\nTherefore, the RMT-ADC estimator can avoid the higher under-estimation\nprobability of the RMT estimator. Finally, simulation results are presented to\nshow that the proposed RMT-ADC estimator significantly outperforms the existing\nestimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 13:18:47 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 14:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 11:38:17 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2015 12:24:00 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 14:41:24 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2015 11:51:49 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 13:25:27 GMT"},{"version":"v16","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 14:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v17","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 15:10:52 GMT"},{"version":"v18","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 15:05:27 GMT"},{"version":"v19","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 14:31:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2014 11:18:28 GMT"},{"version":"v20","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 12:56:41 GMT"},{"version":"v21","created":"Sat, 13 Apr 2019 16:07:50 GMT"},{"version":"v22","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 15:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 13:19:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 12:29:16 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 08:34:21 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 14:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 13:20:51 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 13:22:46 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 14:16:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-27"}

However physically relevant properties of related\nquantum systems have not yet received due (and scientifically undisputable)\ncoverage in the literature. In the present paper we address\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger-type eigenvalue problems for $H=T+V$, where a kinetic term\n$T=T_m$ is a quasirelativistic energy operator $T_m = \\sqrt{-\\hbar ^2c^2 \\Delta\n+ m^2c^4} - mc^2$ of mass $m\\in (0,\\infty)$ particle. A potential $V$ we assume\nto refer to the harmonic confinement or finite well of an arbitrary depth. We\nanalyze spectral solutions of the pertinent nonlocal quantum systems with a\nfocus on their $m$-dependence. Extremal mass $m$ regimes for eigenvalues and\neigenfunctions of $H$ are investigated: (i) $m\\ll 1$ spectral affinity\n(\"closeness\") with the Cauchy-eigenvalue problem ($T_m \\sim T_0=\\hbar c |\\nabla\n|$) and (ii) $m \\gg 1$ spectral affinity with the nonrelativistic eigenvalue\nproblem ($T_m \\sim -\\hbar ^2 \\Delta /2m $). To this end we generalize to\nnonlocal operators an efficient computer-assisted method to solve\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger eigenvalue problems, widely used in quantum physics and quantum\nchemistry. A resultant spectrum-generating algorithm allows to carry out all\ncomputations directly in the configuration space of the nonlocal quantum\nsystem. This allows for a proper assessment of the spatial nonlocality impact\non simulation outcomes. Although the nonlocality of $H$ might seem to stay in\nconflict with various numerics-enforced cutoffs, this potentially serious\nobstacle is kept under control and effectively tamed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 13:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-26"}

Destabilization occurs when one or both planets\nis near the critical mass needed to open a gap in the gaseous disk. A confined\ngap is opened that spans the 60 degree azimuthal separation between planets.\nThis alters the torques imparted by the disk on each planet -- pushing the\nleading planet outward and the trailing planet inward -- and disrupts the\nresonance. The mechanism applies to systems in which the two planets' masses\ndiffer by a factor of two or less. In a simple flared disk model the critical\nmass for gap opening varies from a few Earth masses at the inner edge of the\ndisk to 1 Saturn-mass at 5 AU.

As part of the CHESS (Chemical\nHerschel Survey of Star Forming Regions) Key Programme, AFGL 2591 was observed\nby the Herschel/HIFI instrument. The spectral survey covered a frequency range\nfrom 480 up to 1240 GHz as well as single lines from 1267 to 1901 GHz (i.e. CO,\nHCl, NH3, OH and [CII]). Rotational and population diagram methods were used to\ncalculate column densities, excitation temperatures and the emission extents of\nthe observed molecules associated with AFGL 2591. The analysis was supplemented\nwith several lines from ground-based JCMT spectra. From the HIFI spectral\nsurvey analysis a total of 32 species were identified (including\nisotopologues). In spite of the fact that lines are mostly quite week, 268\nemission and 16 absorption lines were found (excluding blends). Molecular\ncolumn densities range from 6e11 to 1e19 cm-2 and excitation temperatures range\nfrom 19 to 175 K. One can distinguish cold (e.g. HCN, H2S, NH3 with\ntemperatures below 70 K) and warm species (e.g. CH3OH, SO2) in the protostellar\nenvelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 15:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

Such behavioral\nfeedback is particularly important in navigation. Successful navigation relies\non proper coupling between sensors, which gather information during motion, and\nactuators, which control behavior. Because reorientation conditions future\ninputs, behavioral feedback can place sensors and actuators in an operational\nregime different from the resting state. How then can organisms maintain proper\ninformation transfer through the pathway while navigating diverse environments?\nIn bacterial chemotaxis, robust performance is often attributed to the zero\nintegral feedback control of the sensor, which guarantees that activity returns\nto resting state when the input remains constant. While this property provides\nsensitivity over a wide range of signal intensities, it remains unclear how\nother parameters affect chemotactic performance, especially when considering\nthat the swimming behavior of the cell determines the input signal. Using\nanalytical models and simulations that incorporate recent experimental\nevidences about behavioral feedback and flagellar motor adaptation we identify\nan operational regime of the pathway that maximizes drift velocity for various\nenvironments and sensor adaptation rates. This optimal regime is outside the\ndynamic range of the motor response, but maximizes the contrast between run\nduration up and down gradients. In steep gradients, the feedback from\nchemotactic drift can push the system through a bifurcation. This creates a\nnon-chemotactic state that traps cells unless the motor is allowed to adapt.\nAlthough motor adaptation helps, we find that as the strength of the feedback\nincreases individual phenotypes cannot maintain the optimal operational regime\nin all environments, suggesting that diversity could be beneficial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 15:49:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 15:41:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 16:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

This is achieved by predicting an individual voter's\nlikelihood to vote and an individual voter's likelihood to vote for a given\nparty, if he votes. We make a rough prediction of these values. We then update\nthese predictions by incorporating information on a municipality wide basis via\naggregate data to enhance our estimate under the assumption that nearby voters\nhave similar behavior, which could be due to social interaction or common\nexternal factors. Finally, we use a ranking scheme on these predictions to\nidentify two key types of voter: 1) Voters who are likely to vote that we can\nconvince to vote for a given party; and, 2) Voters who are likely to vote for a\ngiven party, if they vote, that we can convince to actually turn out to vote.\nOnce these voters have been identified, a political campaign can use this\ninformation to micro-target voters and win more votes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 06:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

The\naim of this study was to test probable correlation between solar activities and\nGMD with long-term variations of MS incidence.\n  Methods: After a systematic review, we studied the association between\nalterations in solar wind velocity (Vsw) and planetary A index (Ap, a GMD\nindex) with MS incidence in Tehran and western Greece, during the 23rd solar\ncycle (1996-2008), by an ecological-correlational study.\n  Results: We found moderate to strong correlations among MS incidence of\nTehran with Vsw (Rs=0.665, p=0.013), with one year delay, and also with Ap\n(Rs=0.864, p=0.001) with 2 year delay. There were very strong correlations\namong MS incidence data of Greece with Vsw (R=0.906, p<0.001) and with Ap\n(R=0.844, p=0.001), both with one year lag.\n  Conclusion: It is the first time that a hypothesis has introduced an\nenvironmental factor that may describe MS incidence alterations; however, it\nshould be reminded that correlation does not mean necessarily the existence of\na causal relationship. Important message of these findings for researchers is\nto provide MS incidence reports with higher resolution for consecutive years,\nbased on the time of disease onset and relapses, not just the time of\ndiagnosis.

This view\nis mathematically appealing and natural because of the affine structure of the\nspace of probability measures. Behavioural economists and psychologists, on the\nother hand, have demonstrated that humans consistently violate the EU postulate\nby switching from risk-averse to risk-taking behaviour. This paradox has led to\nthe development of descriptive theories of decisions, such as the celebrated\nprospect theory, which uses an $S$-shaped value function with concave and\nconvex branches explaining the observed asymmetry. Although successful in\nmodelling human behaviour, these theories appear to contradict the natural set\nof axioms behind the EU postulate. Here we show that the observed asymmetry in\nbehaviour can be explained if, apart from utilities of the outcomes, rational\nagents also value information communicated by random events. We review the main\nideas of the classical value of information theory and its generalizations.\nThen we prove that the value of information is an $S$-shaped function, and that\nits asymmetry does not depend on how the concept of information is defined, but\nfollows only from linearity of the expected utility. Thus, unlike many\ndescriptive and `non-expected' utility theories that abandon the linearity\n(i.e. the `independence' axiom), we formulate a rigorous argument that the von\nNeumann and Morgenstern rational agents should be both risk-averse and\nrisk-taking if they are not indifferent to information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 12:57:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-22"}
