New insights into plasmonic\nnanofocusing mechanisms are obtained by invoking an analogy of the 'photon\nfluid' (PF). By proper nanostructure design, PF kinetic energy can be locally\nincreased via convective acceleration and then converted into 'pressure' energy\nto generate localized areas of high field intensity. In particular, trapped\nlight can be molded into optical vortices -tornado-like areas of circular\nmotion of power flux - connected into transmission-like sequences. In the\nelectromagnetic theory terms, this approach is based on radiationless\nelectromagnetic interference of evanescent fields rather than on interference\nof propagating waves radiated by the dipoles induced in nanoparticles. The\nresulting ability to manipulate optical powerflow well beyond the diffraction\nlimit helps to reduce dissipative losses, to increase the amount of energy\naccumulated within a nanoscale volume, and to activate magnetic response in\nnon-magnetic nanostructures.

Specifically we study the problem of estimating\nthe mean $\\vec{\\theta}$ of an unknown $d$ dimensional gaussian distribution in\nthe distributed setting.

The goal is to\nestimate the mean $\\vec{\\theta}$ at the optimal minimax rate while\ncommunicating as few bits as possible. We show that in this setting, the\ncommunication cost scales linearly in the number of dimensions i.e. one needs\nto deal with different dimensions individually.

The Big Data is partitioned recursively into clusters using a spectral\nclustering algorithm on the generated sparse graph. We consider each cluster as\none point in a Grassmann manifold, and measure the geodesic distance among\nthese points. The distances are further analyzed using a min-max algorithm [1]\nto extract an optimal subset of clusters.

In continuation of our previous works, we show that in the\nM-flation model induced from a supersymmetric 10d background probed by a stack\nof $N$ D3-branes, the \"effective inflaton\" $\\phi$ has a double-well Higgs-like\npotential, with minima at $\\phi=0,\\mu$.

Coupled with environmental fluctuations in\ndemographic rates, Allee effects can have subtle effects on population\npersistence and extinction. To understand the interplay between these\ndeterministic and stochastic forces, we analyze discrete-time single species\nmodels allowing for general forms of density-dependent feedbacks and stochastic\nfluctuations in demographic rates. Our analysis provide criteria for stochastic\npersistence, asymptotic extinction, and conditional persistence. Stochastic\npersistence requires that the geometric mean of fitness at low densities is\ngreater than one. When this geometric mean is less than one, asymptotic\nextinction occurs with a high probability whenever the initial population\ndensity is low. If in addition the population only experiences positive\ndensity-dependent feedbacks, conditional persistence occurs provided the\ngeometric mean of fitness at high population densities is greater than one.\nHowever, if the population experiences both positive and negative\ndensity-dependent feedbacks, conditional persistence is only possible if\nfluctuations in demographic rates are sufficiently small. Applying our results\nto stochastic models of mate-limitation, we illustrate counter-intuitively that\nthe environmental fluctuations can increase the probability of persistence when\npopulations are initially at low densities, and decrease the likelihood of\npersistence when populations are initially at high densities. Alternatively,\nfor stochastic models accounting for predator saturation and negative\ndensity-dependence, environmental stochasticity can result in asymptotic\nextinction at intermediate predation rates despite conditional persistence\noccurring at higher predation rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 18:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

In particular, in the case of dark matter\nannihilation into gauge bosons, HAWC will be able to detect a narrow range of\ndark matter masses to cross-sections below thermal. HAWC should also be\nsensitive to non-thermal cross-sections for masses up to nearly 1000 TeV. The\nconstraints placed by HAWC on the dark matter cross-section from known sources\nshould be competitive with current limits in the mass range where HAWC has\nsimilar sensitivity.

The first trend can be caused by strong versus weak magnetic\nbraking (the Kraft break), rather than realignment of the star's convective\nenvelope versus the entire star. The second trend can result from a small\neffective stellar moment of inertia participating in the tidal realignment in\nhot stars, enabling massive retrograde planets to partially realign to become\nprograde. The third trend is attributable to higher mass planets more\neffectively counteracting braking to spin up their stars. Both hot and cool\nstar require a small effective stellar moment of inertia participating in the\ntidal realignment, e.g., an outer layer weakly coupled to the interior.

Further\nmotion of the steps away from the catalyst tip with attached rims of the carbon\ncap generates the wall of the nanotube.

To this\naim, it is customary to enforce a constant value for either the flow rate (CFR)\nor the pressure gradient (CPG). When comparing a laminar duct flow before and\nafter a geometrical modification that induces a change of the viscous drag,\nboth approaches (CFR and CPG) lead to a change of the power input across the\ncomparison. Similarly, when carrying out the (DNS and LES) numerical simulation\nof unsteady turbulent flows, the power input is not constant over time.\nCarrying out a simulation at constant power input (CPI) is thus a further\nphysically sound option, that becomes particularly appealing in the context of\nflow control, where a comparison between control-on and control-off conditions\nhas to be made.\n  We describe how to carry out a CPI simulation, and start with defining a new\npower-related Reynolds number, whose velocity scale is the bulk flow that can\nbe attained with a given pumping power in the laminar regime. Under the CPI\ncondition, we derive a relation that is equivalent to the\nFukagata--Iwamoto--Kasagi relation valid for CFR (and to its extension valid\nfor CPG), that presents the additional advantage of natively including the\nrequired control power. The implementation of the CPI approach is then\nexemplified in the standard case of a plane turbulent channel flow, and then\nfurther applied to a flow control case, where the spanwise-oscillating wall is\nused for skin friction drag reduction. For this low-Reynolds number flow, using\n90% of the available power for the pumping system and the remaining 10% for the\ncontrol system is found to be the optimum share that yields the largest\nincrease of the flow rate above the reference case, where 100% of the power\ngoes to the pump.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 20:42:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

This is motivated by apparently two contrasting results even\nfor a simple 3 node network, with a single half-duplex relay. When all channels\nare assumed to be i.i.d. fading, a static schedule where the relay listens half\nthe time and transmits half the time combined with quantize-map-forward (QMF)\nrelaying is known to achieve the full-duplex performance. However, when there\nis no direct link between source and destination, a dynamic-decode-forward\n(DDF) strategy is needed to achieve the optimal tradeoff. In this case, a\nstatic schedule is strictly suboptimal and the optimal tradeoff is\nsignificantly worse than the full-duplex performance. In this paper we study\nthe general case when the direct link is neither as strong as the other links\nnor fully non-existent, and identify regimes where dynamic schedules are\nnecessary and those where static schedules are enough. We identify 4\nqualitatively different regimes for the single relay channel where the tradeoff\nbetween diversity and multiplexing is significantly different. We show that in\nall these regimes one of the above two strategies is sufficient to achieve the\noptimal tradeoff by developing a new upper bound on the best achievable\ntradeoff under channel state information available only at the receivers. A\nnatural next question is whether these two strategies are sufficient to achieve\nthe DMT of more general half-duplex wireless networks. We propose a\ngeneralization of the two existing schemes through a dynamic QMF (DQMF)\nstrategy, where the relay listens for a fraction of time depending on received\nCSI but not long enough to be able to decode. We show that such a DQMF strategy\nis needed to achieve the optimal DMT in a parallel channel with two relays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2014 00:16:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 02:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

However, how well can we approximate\nthe integer hull by just using sparse cutting-planes? In order to understand\nthis question better, given a polyope $P$ (e.g. the integer hull of a MIP), let\n$P^k$ be its best approximation using cuts with at most $k$ non-zero\ncoefficients. We consider $d(P, P^k) = \\max_{x \\in P^k} \\left(min_{y \\in P} \\|\nx - y\\|\\right)$ as a measure of the quality of sparse cuts.\n  In our first result, we present general upper bounds on $d(P, P^k)$ which\ndepend on the number of vertices in the polytope and exhibits three phases as\n$k$ increases. Our bounds imply that if $P$ has polynomially many vertices,\nusing half sparsity already approximates it very well.

Each firm tries to maximize\nits utility---a function of the production cost as well as market price of the\nproduct---by deciding on the amount of production. In today's dynamic and\ndiverse economy, many firms often compete in more than one market\nsimultaneously, i.e., each market might be shared among a subset of these\nfirms. In this situation, a bipartite graph models the access restriction where\nfirms are on one side, markets are on the other side, and edges demonstrate\nwhether a firm has access to a market or not. We call this game \\emph{Network\nCournot Competition} (NCC). In this paper, we propose algorithms for finding\npure Nash equilibria of NCC games in different situations. First, we carefully\ndesign a potential function for NCC, when the price functions for markets are\nlinear functions of the production in that market. However, for nonlinear price\nfunctions, this approach is not feasible. We model the problem as a nonlinear\ncomplementarity problem in this case, and design a polynomial-time algorithm\nthat finds an equilibrium of the game for strongly convex cost functions and\nstrongly monotone revenue functions. We also explore the class of price\nfunctions that ensures strong monotonicity of the revenue function, and show it\nconsists of a broad class of functions. Moreover, we discuss the uniqueness of\nequilibria in both of these cases which means our algorithms find the unique\nequilibria of the games. Last but not least, when the cost of production in one\nmarket is independent from the cost of production in other markets for all\nfirms, the problem can be separated into several independent classical\n\\emph{Cournot Oligopoly} problems.

The mock\nimages suggest that the post-merger features involve a small fraction of stars,\nand the merger-feature time depends on galaxy interactions. In an isolated\nenvironment, the merger-feature time is, on average, $\\sim$ 2 times the final\ncoalescence time for a shallow surface bright limit of 25 mag/arcsec^2. For a\ndeeper surface brightness limit of 28 mag/arcsec^2, however, the merger-feature\ntime is a factor of two longer, which is why the detection of post-merger\nfeatures using shallow surveys has been difficult. Tidal force of a cluster\npotential is effective in stripping post-merger features out and reduces the\nmerger-feature time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2014 05:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

However, this would require the frequency of\nclose massive binaries to be metallicity dependent.

These could be due to foreground residuals and or systematic\neffects, though their confirmation with Planck data suggests they are not due\nto a problem in the WMAP or Planck pipelines. If these anomalies are in fact\nprimordial, then understanding their origin is fundamental to either validate\nthe standard model of cosmology or to explore new physics. We investigate three\nother possible issues: 1) the trade-off between minimising systematics due to\nforeground contamination (with a conservative mask) and minimising systematics\ndue to masking, 2) astrophysical secondary effects (the kinetic Doppler\nquadrupole and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect), and 3) secondary\ncosmological signals (the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect). We address the\nmasking issue by considering new procedures that use both WMAP and Planck to\nproduce higher quality full-sky maps using the sparsity methodology (LGMCA\nmaps). We show the impact of masking is dominant over that of residual\nforegrounds, and the LGMCA full-sky maps can be used without further processing\nto study anomalies. We consider four official Planck PR1 and two LGMCA CMB\nmaps. Analysis of the observed CMB maps shows that only the low quadrupole and\nquadrupole-octopole alignment seem significant, but that the planar octopole,\nAxis of Evil, mirror parity and cold spot are not significant in nearly all\nmaps considered.

Moreover, the transaction syntax\nallows to create the so-called contracts, where a number of\nmutually-distrusting parties engage in a protocol to jointly perform some\nfinancial task, and the fairness of this process is guaranteed by the\nproperties of Bitcoin.

In the limit of a small Josephson\ncoupling energy $E_J \\ll k_B T$ the thermal fluctuations result in a stochastic\ndependence of the Josephson phase $\\varphi$ on time, i.e the Josephson phase\ndiffusion. These thermal fluctuations destroy the superconducting state, and\nthe low-voltage resistive state is characterized by a nonlinear $I$-$V$ curve.\nSuch $I$-$V$ curve is determined by the resonant interaction of ac Josephson\ncurrent with the Josephson phase oscillations excited in the junction. The main\nfrequency of ac Josephson current is $\\omega=eV/\\hbar$, where $V$ is the\nvoltage drop on the junction. In the phase diffusion regime the Josephson phase\noscillations show a broad spectrum of frequencies. The average $I$-$V$ curve is\ndetermined by the time-dependent correlations of the Josephson phase. By making\nuse of the method of averaging elaborated in Ref. M. V. Fistul and G.

The latter\nregime can be realized in the case of low dissipation.

The frequency conversion of OAM-carrying light\ngives rise to new physics and applications such as up-conversion detection of\nimages and high dimensional OAM entanglements. Quasi-phase matching (QPM)\nnonlinear crystals are good candidates for frequency conversion, particularly\nfor their high-valued effective nonlinear coefficients and no walk-off effect.\nHere we report the first experimental second-harmonic generation (SHG) of OAM\nlight with a QPM crystal, where a UV light with OAM of 100 is generated. OAM\nconservation is verified using a specially designed interferometer. With a pump\nbeam carrying an OAM superposition of opposite sign, we observed interesting\ninterference phenomena in the SHG light; specifically, a photonics gear-like\nstructure is obtained that gives direct evidence of OAM conservation, which\nwill be very useful for ultra-sensitive angular measurements. We also develop a\ntheory to reveal the underlying physics of the phenomena.

Here\nwe study the survival of the Galilean satellites in the jumping-Jupiter model.\nThis is an important concern because the ice-giant encounters, if deep enough,\ncould dynamically perturb the orbits of the Galilean satellites, and lead to\nimplausible results. We performed numerical integrations where we tracked the\neffect of planetary encounters on the Galilean moons. We considered three\ninstability cases from Nesvorny & Morbidelli (2012) that differed in the number\nand distribution of encounters. We found that in one case, where the number of\nclose encounters was relatively small, the Galilean satellite orbits were not\nsignificantly affected. In the other two, the orbital eccentricities of all\nmoons were excited by encounters, Callisto's semimajor axis changed, and, in a\nlarge fraction of trials, the Laplace resonance of the inner three moons was\ndisrupted. The subsequent evolution by tides damps eccentricities and can\nrecapture the moons in the Laplace resonance. A more important constraint is\nrepresented by the orbital inclinations of the moons, which can be excited\nduring the encounters and not appreciably damped by tides. We find that one\ninstability case taken from Nesvorny & Morbidelli (2012) clearly fails this\nconstraint. This shows how the regular satellites of Jupiter can be used to set\nlimits on the properties of encounters in the jumping-Jupiter model, and help\nus to better understand how the early Solar System evolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2014 11:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

A hyperplane $\\Hy$ is an \\emph{$m$-separator} for\n$\\D$ if each closed halfspace bounded by $\\Hy$ contains at least $m$ points\nfrom $P$. This generalizes the notion of halving hyperplanes, which correspond\nto $n/2$-separators. The analogous notion for point sets has been well studied.\nSeparators have various applications, for instance, in divide-and-conquer\nschemes. In such a scheme any ball that is intersected by the separating\nhyperplane may still interact with both sides of the partition. Therefore it is\ndesirable that the separating hyperplane intersects a small number of balls\nonly. We present three deterministic algorithms to bisect or approximately\nbisect a given set of disjoint unit balls by a hyperplane: Firstly, we present\na simple linear-time algorithm to construct an $\\alpha n$-separator for balls\nin $\\R^d$, for any $0<\\alpha<1/2$, that intersects at most $cn^{(d-1)/d}$\nballs, for some constant $c$ that depends on $d$ and $\\alpha$.

As the TAMR effect\nrequires only a single magnetic electrode, in contrast to the tunnelling\nmagnetoresistance effect, it offers an attractive route towards alternative\nspintronics applications. In this work we consider the TAMR effect at the\nsingle-atom limit by investigating the anisotropy of the local density of\nstates in the vacuum above transition-metal adatoms adsorbed on a noncollinear\nmagnetic surface, the monolayer of Mn on W(110). This surface presents a\ncycloidal spin spiral ground state with an angle of 173$^\\circ$ between\nneighbouring spins and thus allows a quasi-continuous exploration of the\nangular dependence of the TAMR of adsorbed adatoms using scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the TAMR of Co,\nRh and Ir adatoms on Mn/W(110) and relate our results to magnetization\ndirection dependent changes in the local density of states. The anisotropic\neffect is found to be enhanced dramatically on the adsorption of heavy\ntransition-metal atoms, with values of up to 50% predicted from our\ncalculations.

For the \"$\\gamma\\gamma$\"\nStone Wales defect in TBLG, we observe two Dirac cones that are shifted in both\nmomentum space and energy. This up/down shift in energy results from the\ncombined effect of a charge transfer between the two graphene layers, and a\nchemical interaction between the layers, which mimics the effects of a\ntransverse electric field. Charge density plots show that states near the Dirac\npoints have significant admixture between the two layers. For Stone Wales\ndefects at other sites in TBLG, this basic structure is modified by the\ncreation of mini gaps at energy crossings. For a monovacancy, the Dirac cone of\nthe pristine layer is shifted up in energy by $\\sim0.25$ eV due to a\ncombination of the requirements of the equilibration of Fermi energy between\nthe two layers with different numbers of electrons, charge transfer, and\nchemical interactions. Both kinds of defects increase the density of states at\nthe Fermi level. The monovacancy also results in spin polarization, with\nmagnetic moments on the defect of 1.2 - 1.8 $\\mu_B$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2014 13:58:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

In\nthe first paper of this series, a surprisingly large fraction of optical light\nwas found to be resolved in the 89 Her post-AGB system. The data showed this\nflux to arise from close to the central binary. Scattering off the inner rim of\nthe circumbinary disk, or in a dusty outflow were suggested as two possible\norigins. With detailed dust radiative transfer models of the disk we aim to\ndiscriminate between these two configurations. By including Herschel/SPIRE\nphotometry, we extend the SED such that it now fully covers UV to sub-mm\nwavelengths. The MCMax radiative transfer code is used to create a large grid\nof disk models. Our models include a self-consistent treatment of dust settling\nas well as of scattering. A Si-rich composition with two additional opacity\nsources, metallic Fe or amorphous C, are tested. The SED is fit together with\nmid-IR (MIDI) visibilities as well as the optical and near-IR visibilities of\nPaper I, to constrain the structure of the disk and in particular of its inner\nrim. The near-IR visibility data require a smooth inner rim, here obtained with\na two-power-law parameterization of the radial surface density distribution. A\nmodel can be found that fits all the IR photometric and interferometric data\nwell, with either of the two continuum opacity sources. Our best-fit passive\nmodels are characterized by a significant amount of mm-sized grains, which are\nsettled to the midplane of the disk. Not a single disk model fits our data at\noptical wavelengths though, the reason being the opposing constraints imposed\nby the optical and near-IR interferometric data. A geometry in which a passive,\ndusty, and puffed-up circumbinary disk is present, can reproduce all the IR but\nnot the optical observations of 89 Her.

The exact implementation of the Gauss laws reduces the colored spin-1\ngluons and spin-1/2 quarks to unconstrained colorless spin-0, spin-1, spin-2\nand spin-3 glueball fields and colorless Rarita-Schwinger fields. The obtained\nphysical Hamiltonian naturally admits a systematic strong-coupling expansion in\npowers of \\lambda=g^{-2/3}, equivalent to an expansion in the number of spatial\nderivatives. The leading-order term corresponds to non-interacting\nhybrid-glueballs, whose low-lying spectrum can be calculated with high accuracy\nby solving the Schr\\\"odinger-equation of the Dirac-Yang-Mills quantum mechanics\nof spatially constant fields (at the moment only for the 2-color case). The\ndiscrete glueball excitation spectrum shows a universal string-like behaviour\nwith practically all excitation energy going in to the increase of the\nstrengths of merely two fields, the \"constant Abelian fields\" corresponding to\nthe zero-energy valleys of the chromomagnetic potential. Inclusion of the\nfermionic degrees of freedom significantly lowers the spectrum and allows for\nthe study of the sigma meson. Higher-order terms in \\lambda lead to\ninteractions between the hybrid-glueballs and can be taken into account\nsystematically using perturbation theory, allowing for the study of\nIR-renormalisation and Lorentz invariance. The existence of the generalized\npolar decomposition used, the position of the zeros of the corresponding\nJacobian (Gribov horizons), and the ranges of the physical variables can be\ninvestigated by solving a system of algebraic equations. It is exactly solvable\nfor 1 spatial dimension and several numerical solutions can be found for 2 and\n3 spatial dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 May 2014 15:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-09"}

Adiabatic quantum computing uses the principle of quantum\nannealing, which implies that a carefully controlled energy solution is optimal\nand corresponds to minimizing a discrete function. The input function can be\ninfluenced by rewards and penalties to favor a solution that meets restrictions\nthat are imposed by the problem. We show how to accomplish this influence for\ngates in adiabatic quantum computing, particularly the controlled-NOT gate\n(CNOT gate) which is fundamental to all quantum gates on two or more qubits. In\naddition, we adapt the Toffoli gate, the Fredkin gate, and the Hadamard gate to\nthe Ising objective function which is a foundation for discrete optimization on\nD-Wave System machines. The quantum work in this paper encompasses Boolean\noperations, some of which are used to construct gates.

The basic principle of the method is to decompose a speech signal into\nsegments each frame is categorised as either signal-dominant or noise-dominant\nthen reconstruct the signal with IMFs signal dominant frame previously filtered\nor thresholded. It is shown, on the basis of intensive simulations that EMD\nimproves the signal to noise ratio and address the problem of signal\ndegradation.
