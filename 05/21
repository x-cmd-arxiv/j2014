The decay of these nuclei leads to both heating and ionization,\nand thereby affects disk evolution, disk chemistry, and the accompanying\nprocess of planet formation. Nuclear enrichment can take place on two spatial\nscales: [1] Within the cluster itself ($\\ell\\sim1$pc), the SLRs are delivered\nto the circumstellar disks associated with other cluster members. [2] On the\nnext larger scale ($\\ell\\sim2-10$pc), SLRs are injected into the background\nmolecular cloud; these nuclei provide heating and ionization to nearby\nstar-forming regions, and to the next generation of disks. For the first\nscenario, we construct the expected distributions of radioactive enrichment\nlevels provided by embedded clusters. Clusters can account for the SLR mass\nfractions inferred for the early Solar Nebula, but typical SLR abundances are\nlower by a factor of $\\sim10$. For the second scenario, we find that\ndistributed enrichment of SLRs in molecular clouds leads to comparable\nabundances.

Exact inference in CGMs is intractable,\nand previous work has explored Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and MAP\napproximations for learning and inference. This paper studies Gaussian\napproximations to the CGM. As the population grows large, we show that the CGM\ndistribution converges to a multivariate Gaussian distribution (GCGM) that\nmaintains the conditional independence properties of the original CGM. If the\nobservations are exact marginals of the CGM or marginals that are corrupted by\nGaussian noise, inference in the GCGM approximation can be computed efficiently\nin closed form. If the observations follow a different noise model (e.g.,\nPoisson), then expectation propagation provides efficient and accurate\napproximate inference.

The fraction influenced by\nthermal stratification is considered in the shear production term. This\nthermally affected shear is compared with buoyant term resulting in a stability\nwind shear term. It is also considered Reynolds stress as a sum of two\ncomponents associated with wind shear from mechanical and thermal\nstratification process. The stability wind shear is responsible to Reynolds\nstress of thermal stratification term, and also to Reynolds stress of\nmechanical term at no neutral condition. The wind profile and its derivative\nare validated with data from Pedra do Sal experiment in a flat terrain and 300m\nfrom shoreline located in northeast coast of Brazil. It is close to the Equator\nline, so the meteorological condition are strongly influenced by trade winds\nand sea breeze.

In turn, such operators are\napplied to each agent considering that the complete group has a memory to store\noptimal solutions (ellipses) seen so-far by applying a competition principle.\nThe detector uses a combination of five edge points as parameters to determine\nellipse candidates (possible solutions) while a matching function determines if\nsuch ellipse candidates are actually present in the image. Guided by the values\nof such matching functions, the set of encoded candidate ellipses are evolved\nthrough the evolutionary algorithm so that the best candidates can be fitted\ninto the actual ellipses within the image. Just after the optimization process\nends, an analysis over the embedded memory is executed in order to find the\nbest obtained solution (the best ellipse) and significant local minima\n(remaining ellipses). Experimental results over several complex synthetic and\nnatural images have validated the efficiency of the proposed technique\nregarding accuracy, speed and robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 17:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

The former has achieved a significant automation via real-time\nbidding (RTB); however, the latter is still mainly done over the counter\nthrough direct sales. This paper proposes a mathematical model that allocates\nand prices the future impressions between real-time auctions and guaranteed\ncontracts. Under conventional economic assumptions, our model shows that the\ntwo ways can be seamless combined programmatically and the publisher's revenue\ncan be maximized via price discrimination and optimal allocation. We consider\nadvertisers are risk-averse, and they would be willing to purchase guaranteed\nimpressions if the total costs are less than their private values. We also\nconsider that an advertiser's purchase behavior can be affected by both the\nguaranteed price and the time interval between the purchase time and the\nimpression delivery date. Our solution suggests an optimal percentage of future\nimpressions to sell in advance and provides an explicit formula to calculate at\nwhat prices to sell. We find that the optimal guaranteed prices are dynamic and\nare non-decreasing over time. We evaluate our method with RTB datasets and find\nthat the model adopts different strategies in allocation and pricing according\nto the level of competition. From the experiments we find that, in a less\ncompetitive market, lower prices of the guaranteed contracts will encourage the\npurchase in advance and the revenue gain is mainly contributed by the increased\ncompetition in future RTB. In a highly competitive market, advertisers are more\nwilling to purchase the guaranteed contracts and thus higher prices are\nexpected.

In these dark-matter-dominated systems, self-scattering\nties the shape of the stellar distribution to that of the dark matter\ndistribution.

Most existing variable selection\ntechniques focused on selecting variables that are important for prediction,\ntherefore some variables that are poor in prediction but are critical for\ndecision-making may be ignored. A qualitative interaction of a variable with\ntreatment arises when treatment effect changes direction as the value of this\nvariable varies. The qualitative interaction indicates the importance of this\nvariable for decision-making. Gunter et al.

It can be expressed by a simple phase space integral of an\nin-medium scattering phase shift. In both three and two dimensions (3D and 2D),\nthe interaction energy shows a maximum before reaching the resonance from the\nBose-Einstein condensate side, which provides a possible explanation of the\nexperimental measurements of the interaction energy.

From these we determine a decision threshold to separate\npotentially variant sites from the noisy background.\n  Conclusions: In simulations we show that our simple proposed model is\ncompetitive with frequently used much more complex SNV calling algorithms in\nterms of sensitivity and specificity. It performs specifically well in cases\nwith low allele frequencies. The application to next-generation sequencing data\nreveals stark differences of the score distributions indicating a strong\ninfluence of data specific sources of noise. The proposed model is specifically\ndesigned to adjust to these differences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 22:09:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 18:20:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 15:44:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

Recent surveys have suggested that\nmicroflares may be less efficient particle accelerators than large flares, and\nhence contribute less nonthermal energy, which may have implications for\ncoronal heating mechanisms. We therefore explore the energetic properties of\nmicroflares by combining Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray measurements.\n  We present forward-fitting differential emission measure (DEM) analysis of 10\nmicroflares. The fitting is constrained by combining, for the first time, high\ntemperature RHESSI observations and flux data from SDO/AIA. Two fitting models\nare tested for the DEM; a Gaussian distribution and a uniform DEM profile. A\nGaussian fit proved unable to explain the observations for any of the studied\nmicroflares. However, 8 of 10 events studied were reasonably fit by a uniform\nDEM profile. Hence microflare plasma can be considered to be significantly\nmulti-thermal, and may not be significantly peaked or contain resolvable fine\nstructure, within the uncertainties of the observational instruments.\n  The thermal and non-thermal energy is estimated for each microflare,\ncomparing the energy budget with an isothermal plasma assumption. From the\nmultithermal fits the minimum non-thermal energy content was found to average\napproximately 30% of the estimated thermal energy. By comparison, under an\nisothermal model the non-thermal and thermal energy estimates were generally\ncomparable. Hence, multi-thermal plasma is an important consideration for solar\nmicroflares that substantially alters their thermal and non-thermal energy\ncontent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 23:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In particular, it implies that\n$\\ell_1$ approximation by low-degree polynomials, known to be sufficient for\nagnostic learning over product distributions, is in fact necessary.\n  Focusing on monotone Boolean functions, we exhibit the existence of\nnear-optimal $\\alpha$-approximately\n$\\widetilde{\\Omega}(\\alpha\\sqrt{n})$-resilient monotone functions for all\n$\\alpha>0$. Prior to our work, it was conceivable even that every monotone\nfunction is $\\Omega(1)$-far from any $1$-resilient function. Furthermore, we\nconstruct simple, explicit monotone functions based on ${\\sf Tribes}$ and ${\\sf\nCycleRun}$ that are close to highly resilient functions. Our constructions are\nbased on a fairly general resilience analysis and amplification. These\nstructural results, together with the characterization, imply nearly optimal\nlower bounds for agnostic learning of monotone juntas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2014 00:06:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 19:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-10"}

A reinterpretation of this effect with macroscopic\nmechanical objects can offer a route towards a purely mechanical entanglement\nand the unique possibility of probing the quantum mechanical nature of our\neveryday classical world. In spite of this prospect, mechanical two-mode\nsqueezed states have remained elusive due to the inability to recreate the\nnonlinear interaction at the heart of this phenomenon in the mechanical domain.\nTo address this we have developed a parametric down-converter, in a mechanical\nresonator integrated with electrical functionality, which enables mechanical\nnonlinearities to be dynamically engineered to emulate the parametric\ndown-conversion interaction. In this configuration, phonons are simultaneously\ngenerated in pairs in two macroscopic vibration modes which results in the\namplification of their motion. In parallel, mechanical two-mode squeezed states\nare also created which exhibit fluctuations far below the thermal level of\ntheir constituent modes as well as harbouring correlations between the modes\nthat become almost perfect as their amplification is increased. This remarkable\nobservation of correlations between two massive phonon ensembles paves the way\ntowards an entangled macroscopic mechanical system at the single phonon level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2014 00:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}

This paper proposes\na model of technical security metric to measure the effectiveness of network\nsecurity management. The measurement is based on the effectiveness of security\nperformance for (1) network security controls such as firewall, Intrusion\nDetection Prevention System (IDPS), switch, wireless access point, wireless\ncontrollers and network architecture; and (2) network services such as\nHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) and virtual private network (VPN).\nWe use the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) paradigm [1] which links the measurement\ngoals to measurement questions and produce the metrics that can easily be\ninterpreted in compliance with the requirements. The outcome of this research\nmethod is the introduction of network security management metric as an\nattribute to the Technical Security Metric (TSM) model. Apparently, the\nproposed TSM model may provide guidance for organizations in complying with\neffective measurement requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security\nManagement System (ISMS) standard.

In this paper we present a\nnumerical model based on the critical state with angular field dependence of Jc\nto extract the Jc(B,theta) relation from experimental data. The model takes\ninto account the self-field created by the tape, which gives an important\ncontribution when the field applied in the experiments is low. The same model\ncan also be used to compute the effective critical current of devices composed\nof electromagnetically interacting tapes. Three examples are considered here:\ntwo differently current rated Roebel cables composed of REBCO coated conductors\nand a power cable prototype composed of Bi-2223 tapes. The critical currents\ncomputed with the numerical model show good agreement with the measured ones.\nThe simulations reveal also that several parameter sets in the Jc(B,theta) give\nan equally good representation of the experimental characterization of the\ntapes and that the measured Ic values of cables are subjected to the influence\nof experimental conditions, such as Ic degradation due to the manufacturing and\nassembling process and non-uniformity of the tape properties.

The dwarfs are placed on a radial orbit towards each other with\ntheir angular momenta inclined by 45 deg to the orbital plane and by 90 deg\nwith respect to each other. After 5 Gyr of evolution the merger remnant forms a\nstable triaxial galaxy with rotation only around the longest axis. The origin\nof this rotation is naturally explained as due to the symmetry of the initial\nconfiguration which leads to the conservation of angular momentum components\nalong the direction of the merger. The stars originating from the two dwarfs\nshow significantly different surface density profiles while having very similar\nkinematics in agreement with the properties of separate stellar populations in\nAnd II. We also study an alternative scenario for the formation of And II, via\ntidal stirring of a disky dwarf galaxy. While intrinsic rotation occurs\nnaturally in this model as a remnant of the initial rotation of the disk, it is\nmostly around the shortest axis of the stellar component. The rotation around\nthe longest axis is induced only occasionally and remains much smaller that the\nsystem's velocity dispersion. We conclude that although tidal origin of the\nvelocity distribution in And II cannot be excluded, it is much more naturally\nexplained within the scenario involving a past merger event. Thus, in\nprinciple, the presence of prolate rotation in dSph galaxies of the Local Group\nand beyond may be used as an indicator of major mergers in their history or\neven as a way to distinguish between the two scenarios of their formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2014 07:56:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 12:18:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-12"}

A similar problem has already been\nconsidered in an ``infrastructure'' setting, where all users receive a common\nmulticast (coded) message from a single omniscient server (e.g., a base station\nhaving all the files in the library) through a shared bottleneck link.

We\npropose a caching strategy based on deterministic assignment of subpackets of\nthe library files, and a coded delivery strategy where the users send linearly\ncoded messages to each other in order to collectively satisfy their demands. We\nalso consider a random caching strategy, which is more suitable to a fully\ndecentralized implementation. Under certain conditions, both approaches can\nachieve the information theoretic outer bound within a constant multiplicative\nfactor.

This\nshows that the spatial reuse gain of the D2D network is order-equivalent to the\ncoded multicasting gain of single base station transmission. It is therefore\nnatural to ask whether these two gains are cumulative, i.e.,if a D2D network\nwith both local communication (spatial reuse) and coded multicasting can\nprovide an improved scaling law.

Although the minimization of total\nvariation (TV) regularized functionals is among the most popular methods for\nedge-preserving image restoration such methods were only very recently applied\nto cyclic structures. However, as for Euclidean data, TV regularized\nvariational methods suffer from the so called staircasing effect. This effect\ncan be avoided by involving higher order derivatives into the functional.\n  This is the first paper which uses higher order differences of cyclic data in\nregularization terms of energy functionals for image restoration. We introduce\nabsolute higher order differences for $\\mathbb S^1$-valued data in a sound way\nwhich is independent of the chosen representation system on the circle. Our\nabsolute cyclic first order difference is just the geodesic distance between\npoints.

The spectra obtained after filling the gaps in the selected\nsolar-like stars show a net reduction in the overall background level, as well\nas a change in the background parameters. The inferred convective properties\ncould change as much as 200% in the selected example, introducing a bias in the\np-mode frequency of maximum power.

About 30 years ago it was proposed that these signatures are due\nto emission from a family of UV heated nanometer-sized carbonaceous molecules\nknown as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), causing them to be referred\nto as aromatic IR bands (AIBs). Today, the acceptance of the PAH model is far\nfrom settled, as the identification of a single PAH in space has not yet been\nsuccessful and physically relevant theoretical models involving ``true'' PAH\ncross sections do not reproduce the AIBs in detail. In this paper, we use the\nNASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database, which contains over 500\nquantum-computed spectra, in conjunction with a simple emission model, to show\nthat the spectrum produced by any random mixture of at least 30 PAHs converges\nto the same 'kernel'-spectrum. This kernel-spectrum captures the essence of the\nPAH emission spectrum and is highly correlated with observations of AIBs,\nstrongly supporting PAHs as their source. Also, the fact that a large number of\nmolecules are required implies that spectroscopic signatures of the individual\nPAHs contributing to the AIBs spanning the visible, near-infrared, and far\ninfrared spectral regions are weak, explaining why they have not yet been\ndetected.

Most\nmetrology schemes measure a single parameter of a dynamical process by probing\nit with a specially designed quantum state. The success of such a scheme\nusually relies on the process belonging to a particular one-parameter family.\nIf this assumption is violated, or if the goal is to measure more than one\nparameter, a different quantum state may perform better. In the most extreme\ncase, we know nothing about the process and wish to learn everything. This\nrequires quantum process tomography, which demands an informationally-complete\nset of probe states.

In the first scenario, we study a\nspherically symmetric space-time whose matter content includes a tachyon scalar\nfield and a barotropic fluid. By employing a dynamical system analysis, we find\nclassical solutions corresponding to a naked singularity or a black hole\nformation. We then investigate, in a semiclassical manner, loop quantum gravity\ninduced effects on the fate of the classical singularities. By employing an\ninverse triad correction, we identify a subset which corresponds to an outward\nflux of energy, thus avoiding either a naked singularity or a black hole\nformation. Within a holonomy correction, we obtain the semiclassical\ncounterpart of our (classical) general relativistic collapse in which,\nclassical singularity is resolved and replaced by a bounce. In addition, we\nfind a threshold scale for non-singular black hole formation. In the second\nscenario, we employ several models of dark energy to investigate the status of\nthe late time cosmological singularities. In the first one we consider a DGP\nbrane-world model with a GB term being provided for the bulk action; a phantom\nmatter is present on the brane as dark energy component. It is shown that a\ncombination of IR and UV modifications to general relativity replaces a big rip\nby a sudden singularity at late times. The second model we cosnider is the\ngeneralized running vacuum energy (GRVE) model. The Friedmann equation of the\nGRVE model looks much similar to the one of a holographic Ricci dark energy\n(HRDE) model. Despite the analogy between these two models, it turns out that\none of them, a GRVE, is singularity-free in the future while the other, the\nHRDE, is not, which can hit, for example, a big rip singularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 May 2014 15:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-22"}

In this paper, we analyze a randomized\nsolution for long-lived renaming. The algorithmic technique we consider, called\nthe LevelArray, has previously been used for hashing and one-shot (single-use)\nrenaming. Our main contribu- tion is to prove that, in long-lived executions,\nwhere processes may register and deregister polynomially many times, the\ntechnique guarantees constant steps on average and O(log log n) steps with high\nprobability for registering, unit cost for deregistering, and O(n) steps for\ncollect queries, where n is an upper bound on the number of processes that may\nbe active at any point in time. We also show that the algorithm has the\nsurprising property that it is self-healing: under reasonable assumptions on\nthe schedule, operations running while the data structure is in a degraded\nstate implicitly help the data structure re-balance itself. This subtle\nmechanism obviates the need for expensive periodic rebuilding procedures. Our\nbenchmarks validate this approach, showing that, for typical use parameters,\nthe average number of steps a process takes to register is less than two and\nthe worst-case number of steps is bounded by six, even in executions with\nbillions of operations.

As one particular consequence, the\ntextbooks and educational courses are lacking detailed explanation of\nevaporation and its effects. In order to advance fundamental theory of\nevaporation and increase accuracy of evaporation simulation a novel evaporation\ntheory is presented. This integrated Atomistic(Molecular)-Kinetics-Gasdynamics\ntheoretical model that combines statistical mechanics, gas dynamics and\nthermodynamics approaches opens a path to detailed description of\nnonstationary, nonequilibrium evaporation of condensed matter. The main\ninnovation of the proposed approach is that, unlike all previous and current\nmodels of evaporation that are based on the assumption of evaporation as\nemission of the particles that are not bound within the condense phase, the\ndescribed new model treats evaporation of condensed phase as escape of the\nparticles of sufficient kinetic energy out of potential well located at the\nboundary of condensed and gaseous phases. Correspondingly, the re-condensation\nof the vapor onto the surface is treated as entrapment of the vapor particles\nwith kietic energy lower than the depth of the potential well. The described\nnovel research will open new opportunities to substantially advance our\nknowledge and provide needed contributions to chemical, combustion,\nenvironmental, climate and other sciences that utilize evaporation theory.\nAdditionally, it will provide invaluable new material for the undergraduate and\ngraduate educational courses in Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, and Material\nSciences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 19:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-10"}
