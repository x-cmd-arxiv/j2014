This proved to be problematic in that unlike in the\nclassical Boltzmann kinetic equation, the contribution from the kinetic entropy\nterm was non-positive; (3) Kadanoff surmised that this situation could perhaps\nbe related to quantum entanglement that may not have been included in his\ntheory.

In this paper, we study new models\nfor optimizing fare inspection strategies in transit networks based on bilevel\nprogramming. In the first level, the leader (the network operator) determines\nprobabilities for inspecting passengers at different locations, while in the\nsecond level, the followers (the fare-evading passengers) respond by optimizing\ntheir routes given the inspection probabilities and travel times. To model the\nfollowers' behavior we study both a non-adaptive variant, in which passengers\nselect a path a priori and continue along it throughout their journey, and an\nadaptive variant, in which they gain information along the way and use it to\nupdate their route. For these problems, which are interesting in their own\nright, we design exact and approximation algorithms and we prove a tight bound\nof 3/4 on the ratio of the optimal cost between adaptive and non-adaptive\nstrategies. For the leader's optimization problem, we study a fixed-fare and a\nflexible-fare variant, where ticket prices may or may not be set at the\noperator's will. For the latter variant, we design an LP based approximation\nalgorithm.

High ZT (>2) has been achieved in\nmaterials via all-scale hierarchical architecturing. This efficiency holds at\nhigh temperatures (700K~900K) but quickly diminishes at lower temperatures.

First-principles and model calculations reveal that phosphorene\npossesses spatially-anisotropic electrical and thermal conductances. The\nprominent electrical and thermal conducting directions are orthogonal to one\nanother, enhancing the ratio of these conductances.

Ultimately, phosphorene stands out as an\nenvironmentally sound thermoelectric material with unprecedented qualities:\nintrinsically, it is a mechanically flexible material that converts heat energy\nwith high efficiency at low temperatures (~ 300K) - one whose performance does\nnot require any sophisticated engineering techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 16:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-06"}

Their formation is usually attributed to the\nconcentration of magnetic field to kG strengths by the convective collapse\nmechanism. However, the small size of the magnetic elements in quiet-Sun areas\nhas prevented this scenario from being studied in fully resolved structures.\nHere we report on the formation and subsequent evolution of one such\nphotospheric magnetic flux tube, observed in the quiet Sun with unprecedented\nspatial resolution (0\\farcs 15 - 0\\farcs 18) and high temporal cadence (33 s).\nThe observations were acquired by the Imaging Magnetograph Experiment (IMaX)\naboard the \\textsc{Sunrise} balloon-borne solar observatory. The equipartition\nfield strength magnetic element is the result of the merging of several same\npolarity magnetic flux patches, including a footpoint of a previously emerged\nloop. The magnetic structure is then further intensified to kG field strengths\nby convective collapse. The fine structure found within the flux concentration\nreveals that the scenario is more complex than can be described by a thin flux\ntube model with bright points and downflow plumes being established near the\nedges of the kG magnetic feature. We also observe a daisy-like alignment of\nsurrounding granules and a long-lived inflow towards the magnetic feature.\nAfter a subsequent weakening process, the field is again intensified to kG\nstrengths. The area of the magnetic feature is seen to change in anti-phase\nwith the field strength, while the brightness of the bright points and the\nspeed of the downflows varies in phase. We also find a relation between the\nbrightness of the bright point and the presence of upflows within it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 17:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In the realm of optics, optical loss\nis responsible for power dissipation, therefore typically degrading device\nperformance such as attenuation of a laser beam. By carefully exploiting\noptical loss in the complex dielectric permittivity, however, recent\nexploration of PT symmetry revolutionizes our understandings in fundamental\nphysics and intriguing optical phenomena such as exceptional points and phase\ntransition that are critical for high-speed optical modulators. The interplay\nbetween optical gain and loss in photonic PT synthetic matters offers a new\ncriterion of positively utilizing loss to efficiently manipulate gain and its\nassociated optical properties. Instead of simply compensating optical loss in\nconventional lasers, for example, it is theoretically proposed that judiciously\ndesigned delicate modulation of optical loss and gain can lead to PT synthetic\nlasing that fundamentally broadens laser physics. Here, we report the first\nexperimental demonstration of PT synthetic lasers.

In contrast to\nconventional ring cavity lasers with multiple modes, the PT synthetic\nmicro-ring laser exhibits an intrinsic single mode lasing: the non-threshold PT\nbroken phase inherently associated in such a photonic system squeezes broadband\noptical gain into a single lasing mode regardless of the gain spectral\nbandwidth.

The payment for a particular task is\ntypically set by the task's requester, and may be adjusted based on the quality\nof the completed work, for example, through the use of \"bonus\" payments. In\nthis paper, we study the requester's problem of dynamically adjusting\nquality-contingent payments for tasks. We consider a multi-round version of the\nwell-known principal-agent model, whereby in each round a worker makes a\nstrategic choice of the effort level which is not directly observable by the\nrequester. In particular, our formulation significantly generalizes the\nbudget-free online task pricing problems studied in prior work.\n  We treat this problem as a multi-armed bandit problem, with each \"arm\"\nrepresenting a potential contract. To cope with the large (and in fact,\ninfinite) number of arms, we propose a new algorithm, AgnosticZooming, which\ndiscretizes the contract space into a finite number of regions, effectively\ntreating each region as a single arm. This discretization is adaptively\nrefined, so that more promising regions of the contract space are eventually\ndiscretized more finely. We analyze this algorithm, showing that it achieves\nregret sublinear in the time horizon and substantially improves over\nnon-adaptive discretization (which is the only competing approach in the\nliterature).\n  Our results advance the state of art on several different topics: the theory\nof crowdsourcing markets, principal-agent problems, multi-armed bandits, and\ndynamic pricing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 18:52:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2015 04:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-03"}

In a multi-tier\nnetwork, high power base stations (BSs) such as macro BSs are overlaid by lower\npower small cells such as femtocells and/or picocells. However, co-channel\ndeployment of multiple tiers of BSs gives rise to the problem of cross-tier\ninterference that significantly impacts the performance of wireless networks.\nMulticell cooperation techniques, such as coordinated multipoint (CoMP)\ntransmission, have been proposed as a promising solution to mitigate the impact\nof the cross-tier interference in multi-tier networks. In this paper, we\npropose a novel scheme for Location-Aware Cross-Tier Cooperation (LA-CTC)\nbetween BSs in different tiers for downlink CoMP transmission in two-tier\ncellular networks. On one hand, the proposed scheme only uses CoMP transmission\nto enhance the performance of the users who suffer from high cross-tier\ninterference due to the co-channel deployment of small cells such as picocells.\nOn the other hand, users with good signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio\n(${\\rm SINR}$) conditions are served directly by a single BS from any of the\ntwo tiers. Thus, the data exchange between the cooperating BSs over the\nbackhaul network can be reduced when compared to the traditional CoMP\ntransmission scheme. We use tools from stochastic geometry to quantify the\nperformance gains obtained by using the proposed scheme in terms of outage\nprobability, achievable data rate, and load per BS. We compare the performance\nof the proposed scheme with that of other schemes in the literature such as the\nschemes which use cooperation to serve all users and schemes that use range\nexpansion to offload users to the small cell tier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 19:00:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Sep 2014 11:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-30"}

Random forests are an\nensemble learning method for classification and regression that constructs a\nnumber of randomized decision trees during the training phase and predicts by\naveraging the results. Since its publication in the seminal paper of Breiman\n(2001), the procedure has become a major data analysis tool, that performs well\nin practice in comparison with many standard methods. What has greatly\ncontributed to the popularity of forests is the fact that they can be applied\nto a wide range of prediction problems and have few parameters to tune.

In the last years, however\nan increasing number of systems deviating from these expectations has been\ndiscovered, thus strongly indicating that our understanding of MSPs is far to\nbe complete. The identification of the optical companions to binary MSPs is\ncrucial to constrain the formation and evolution of these objects.

In this\npaper, we present a modular approach which provides modeling and simulation\nsupport for investigation of resource-aware execution in MPSoCs. The proposed\nmethodology enables rapid exploration of the design space by modeling and\nsimulating the resource-awareness in a separate layer while widely reusing the\nlegacy system model in the other layer. Our experiments illustrate the benefits\nof our approach for the exploration of resource-aware execution on MPSoCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 16:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-14"}

On time scales from days to\nyears, substantial changes occur in emission line profiles and line strengths.\nOur extensive time-domain spectroscopy suggests that the broad near-IR,\noptical, and far-uv emission lines, centered on the star, originate in a\nturbulent post-shock region and can undergo scattering by the overlying stellar\nwind as well as some absorption from infalling material. Stable absorption\nfeatures appear in H-alpha, apparently caused by an accreting column\nsilhouetted in the stellar wind. Inflow of material onto the star is revealed\nby the near-IR He I 10830A line, and its free-fall velocity correlates\ninversely with the strength of the post-shock emission, consistent with a\ndipole accretion model. However, the predictions of hydrogen line profiles\nbased on accretion stream models are not well-matched by these observations.\nEvidence of an accelerating warm to hot stellar wind is shown by the near-IR He\nI line, and emission profiles of C II, C III, C IV, N V, and O VI. The outflow\nof material changes substantially in both speed and opacity in the yearly\nsampling of the near-IR He I line over a decade. Terminal outflow velocities\nthat range from 200 km/s to almost 400 km/s in He I appear to be directly\nrelated to the amount of post- shock emission, giving evidence for an\naccretion-driven stellar wind.

The signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) strength governs the\nresulting PIV cross correlation and ultimately the accuracy and uncertainty of\nthe resulting PIV measurement. Hence we posit that correlation SNR metrics\ncalculated from the correlation plane can be used to quantify the quality of\nthe correlation and the resulting uncertainty of an individual measurement. In\nthis paper we present a framework for evaluating the correlation SNR using a\nset of different metrics, which in turn are used to develop models for\nuncertainty estimation. The SNR metrics and corresponding models presented\nherein are expanded to be applicable to both standard and filtered\ncorrelations. In addition, the notion of a valid measurement is redefined with\nrespect to the correlation peak width in order to be consistent with\nuncertainty quantification principles and distinct from an outlier measurement.\nFinally the type and significance of the error distribution function is\ninvestigated. These advancements lead to robust uncertainty estimation models,\nwhich are tested against both synthetic benchmark data as well as actual\nexperimental measurements. For all cases considered here, standard\nuncertainties are estimated at the 68.5% confidence level while expanded\nuncertainties are estimated at 95% confidence level. For all cases the\nresulting calculated coverage factors approximate the expected theoretical\nvalues thus demonstrating the applicability of these new models for estimation\nof uncertainty for individual PIV measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 03:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Despite recent advances, contemporary applications require methods that\nare even faster in order to handle ill-conditioned high dimensional modern day\ndatasets. In this paper, we propose a new method, G-AMA, to solve the sparse\ninverse covariance estimation problem using Alternating Minimization Algorithm\n(AMA), that effectively works as a proximal gradient algorithm on the dual\nproblem. Our approach has several novel advantages over existing methods.\nFirst, we demonstrate that G-AMA is faster than the previous best algorithms by\nmany orders of magnitude and is thus an ideal approach for modern high\nthroughput applications. Second, global linear convergence of G-AMA is\ndemonstrated rigorously, underscoring its good theoretical properties. Third,\nthe dual algorithm operates on the covariance matrix, and thus easily\nfacilitates incorporating additional constraints on pairwise/marginal\nrelationships between feature pairs based on domain specific knowledge. Over\nand above estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix, we also illustrate how\nto (1) incorporate constraints on the (bivariate) correlations and, (2)\nincorporate equality (equisparsity) or linear constraints between individual\ninverse covariance elements. Fourth, we also show that G-AMA is better adept at\nhandling extremely ill-conditioned problems, as is often the case with real\ndata.

However there is currently no consenus\non the formation channel(s) of these objects. The presence of a magnetar in the\nstarburst cluster Westerlund 1 implies a >40Msun progenitor, favouring\nformation in a binary that was disrupted at supernova. To test this hypothesis\nwe searched for the putative pre-SN companion via a radial velocity survey to\nidentify high-velocity runaways, with subsequent atmospheric analysis of the\nresultant candidate, Wd1-5. Wd1-5 appears overluminous for its spectroscopic\nmass and we find evidence of He- and N-enrichment, O-depletion, and critically\nC-enrichment, a combination of properties that is difficult to explain for a\nsingle star. We infer a pre-SN history for Wd1-5 which supposes an initial\nclose binary comprising two stars of comparable (~41Msun+35Msun) masses.\nEfficient mass transfer from the initially more massive component leads to the\nmass-gainer evolving more rapidly, initiating luminous blue variable/common\nenvelope evolution. Reverse, wind-driven mass transfer during its subsequent WC\nWolf-Rayet phase leads to the carbon pollution of Wd1-5, before a type Ibc\nsupernova disrupts the binary system. Under the assumption of a physical\nassociation between Wd1-5 and J1647-45, the secondary is identified as the\nmagnetar progenitor; its common envelope evolutionary phase prevents spin-down\nof its core prior to SN and the seed magnetic field for the magnetar forms\neither in this phase or during the earlier episode of mass transfer in which it\nwas spun-up. Our results suggest that binarity is a key ingredient in the\nformation of at least a subset of magnetars by preventing spin-down via\ncore-coupling and potentially generating a seed magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 11:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

A seminal result of Beurling shows that sample points give rise\nto a classical Fourier frame provided they are relatively separated and of\nsufficient density. However, this result does not allow for arbitrary\nclustering of sample points, as is often the case in practice. Whilst keeping\nthe density condition sharp and dimension independent, our first result removes\nthe separation condition and shows that density alone suffices. However, this\nresult does not lead to estimates for the frame bounds. A known result of\nGroechenig provides explicit estimates, but only subject to a density condition\nthat deteriorates linearly with dimension. In our second result we improve\nthese bounds by reducing the dimension dependence. In particular, we provide\nexplicit frame bounds which are dimensionless for functions having compact\nsupport contained in a sphere. Next, we demonstrate how our two main results\ngive new insight into a reconstruction algorithm---based on the existing\ngeneralized sampling framework---that allows for stable and quasi-optimal\nreconstruction in any particular basis from a finite collection of samples.\nFinally, we construct sufficiently dense sampling schemes that are often used\nin practice---jittered, radial and spiral sampling schemes---and provide\nseveral examples illustrating the effectiveness of our approach when tested on\nthese schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 11:35:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Aug 2014 12:14:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2015 13:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-08"}

Currently,\nsome of them have already been discarded; more than 200 have been confirmed by\nfollow-up observations, and several hundreds have been validated. However, most\nof them are still awaiting for confirmation. Thus, priorities (in terms of the\nprobability of the candidate being a real planet) must be established for\nsubsequent observations. The motivation of this work is to provide a set of\nisolated (good) host candidates to be further tested by other techniques. We\nidentify close companions of the candidates that could have contaminated the\nlight curve of the planet host. We used the AstraLux North instrument located\nat the 2.2 m telescope in the Calar Alto Observatory to obtain\ndiffraction-limited images of 174 Kepler objects of interest. The lucky-imaging\ntechnique used in this work is compared to other AO and speckle imaging\nobservations of Kepler planet host candidates. We define a new parameter, the\nblended source confidence level (BSC), to assess the probability of an object\nto have blended non-detected eclipsing binaries capable of producing the\ndetected transit. We find that 67.2% of the observed Kepler hosts are isolated\nwithin our detectability limits, and 32.8% have at least one visual companion\nat angular separations below 6 arcsec. We find close companions (below 3\narcsec) for the 17.2% of the sample. The planet properties of this sample of\nnon-isolated hosts are revised. We report one possible S-type binary\n(KOI-3158). We also report three possible false positives (KOIs 1230.01,\n3649.01, and 3886.01) due to the presence of close companions. The BSC\nparameter is calculated for all the isolated targets and compared to both the\nvalue prior to any high-resolution image and, when possible, to observations\nfrom previous high-spatial resolution surveys in the Kepler sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 12:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

I show that the interaction between the chiral skyrmions, being\nrepulsive in a broad temperature range, changes into attraction at high\ntemperatures. This leads to a remarkable confinement effect: near the ordering\ntemperature skyrmions exist only as bound states. The confined skyrmions as\ndiscernible units may arrange in different mesophases. The confinement of\nmultiple skyrmions is a consequence of the coupling between the magnitude and\nthe angular part of the order parameter. Thus, near the ordering transitions, I\nconsider the local magnetization not only as multiply twisted but also\nlongitudinally modulated. From numerical investigations on 2D models of\nisotropic chiral ferromagnets, a staggered half-skyrmion square lattice at zero\nand low fields and a hexagonal skyrmion lattice at larger fields are found in\noverlapping regions of the phase diagram near the transition temperature.

The newly discovered dwarf galaxies are dim and\ngas-poor and may be associated with the previously observed arcs of RGB halo\nstars in the halo and the prominent HI filament and the lopsided features in\nthe disk of NGC 891.

It starts with a historical account of\nthe field of asteroseismology followed by a general review of the basic physics\nand properties of stellar pulsations. Emphasis is then naturally placed on the\nstochastic excitation of stellar oscillations and on the potential of\nasteroseismic inference. The chapter closes with a discussion about\nobservational techniques and the observational status of the field. Chapter 2\nis devoted to the subject of data analysis in asteroseismology. This is an\nextensive subject, therefore, a compilation is presented of the relevant data\nanalysis methods and techniques employed contemporarily in asteroseismology of\nsolar-like stars. Special attention has been drawn to the subject of\nstatistical inference both from the competing Bayesian and frequentist\nperspectives. The chapter ends with a description of the implementation of a\npipeline for mode parameter analysis of Kepler data. In the course of these two\nfirst chapters, reference is made to a series of articles led by the author (or\notherwise having greatly benefited from his contribution) that can be found in\nAppendices A to E.

We are interested in a well known subclass\nof convex polyominoes, the k-convex polyominoes for which the enumeration\naccording to the semi-perimeter is known only for k=1,2. We obtain, from a\nrecursive decomposition, the generating function of the class of k-convex\nparallelogram polyominoes, which turns out to be rational. Noting that this\ngenerating function can be expressed in terms of the Fibonacci polynomials, we\ndescribe a bijection between the class of k-parallelogram polyominoes and the\nclass of planted planar trees having height less than k+3. In the second part\nof the thesis we examine the notion of pattern avoidance, which has been\nextensively studied for permutations. We introduce the concept of pattern\navoidance in the context of matrices, more precisely permutation matrices and\npolyomino matrices. We present definitions analogous to those given for\npermutations and in particular we define polyomino classes, i.e. sets downward\nclosed with respect to the containment relation. So, the study of the old and\nnew properties of the redefined sets of objects has not only become\ninteresting, but it has also suggested the study of the associated poset.

Considering the\ncomputational complexity of designing coordinated beamformers for dense\nnetworks, low-complexity and suboptimal precoding strategies are often adopted.\nHowever, it is not clear how much performance loss will be caused. To enable\noptimal coordinated beamforming, in this paper, we propose a framework to\ndesign a scalable beamforming algorithm based on the alternative direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) method. Specifically, we first propose to apply\nthe matrix stuffing technique to transform the original optimization problem to\nan equivalent ADMM-compliant problem, which is much more efficient than the\nwidely-used modeling framework CVX. We will then propose to use the ADMM\nalgorithm, a.k.a. the operator splitting method, to solve the transformed\nADMM-compliant problem efficiently. In particular, the subproblems of the ADMM\nalgorithm at each iteration can be solved with closed-forms and in parallel.\nSimulation results show that the proposed techniques can result in significant\ncomputational efficiency compared to the state- of-the-art interior-point\nsolvers. Furthermore, the simulation results demonstrate that the optimal\ncoordinated beamforming can significantly improve the system performance\ncompared to sub-optimal zero forcing beamforming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 15:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-14"}

To maintain reliability, when a storage node\nfails, a new node should be regenerated by a repair process. Most of the\nprevious results on the repair problem assume perfect (error-free) links in the\nnetworks. However, in practice, especially in a wireless network, the\ntransmitted packets (for repair) may be lost due to, e.g., link failure or\nbuffer overflow. We study the repair problem of distributed storage systems in\npacket erasure networks, where a packet loss is modeled as an erasure. The\nminimum repair-bandwidth, namely the amount of information sent from the\nsurviving nodes to the new node, is established under the ideal assumption of\ninfinite number of packet transmissions. We also study the bandwidth-storage\ntradeoffs in erasure networks. Then, the use of repairing storage nodes (nodes\nwith smaller storage space) is proposed to reduce the repair-bandwidth. We\nstudy the minimal storage of repairing storage nodes. For the case of a finite\nnumber of packet transmissions, the probability of successful repairing is\ninvestigated. We show that the repair with a finite number of packet\ntransmissions may use much larger bandwidth than the minimum repair-bandwidth.\nFinally, we propose a combinatorial optimization problem, which results in the\noptimal repair-bandwidth for the given packet erasure probability and finite\npacket transmissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 15:31:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 20:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-16"}

Satisfying scheme\ninvariance is a challenging problem for perturbative QCD (pQCD), since a\ntruncated perturbation series does not automatically satisfy the requirements\nof the renormalization group. Two distinct approaches for satisfying the RGI\nprinciple have been suggested in the literature. One is the \"Principle of\nMaximum Conformality\" (PMC) in which the terms associated with the\n$\\beta$-function are absorbed into the scale of the running coupling at each\nperturbative order; its predictions are scheme and scale independent at every\nfinite order. The other approach is the \"Principle of Minimum Sensitivity\"\n(PMS), which is based on local RGI; the PMS approach determines the optimal\nrenormalization scale by requiring the slope of the approximant of an\nobservable to vanish. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison of the\nPMC and PMS procedures by analyzing two physical observables $R_{e+e-}$ and\n$\\Gamma(H\\to b\\bar{b})$ up to four-loop order in pQCD. At the four-loop level,\nthe PMC and PMS predictions for both observables agree within small errors with\nthose of conventional scale setting assuming a physically-motivated scale, and\neach prediction shows small scale dependences. However, the convergence of the\npQCD series at high orders, behaves quite differently: The PMC displays the\nbest pQCD convergence since it eliminates divergent renormalon terms; in\ncontrast, the convergence of the PMS prediction is questionable, often even\nworse than the conventional prediction based on an arbitrary guess for the\nrenormalization scale. ......\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 15:48:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 2014 03:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2015 01:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

We aim to reveal properties of the\nchromosphere/Transition Region above the sunspot penumbra using this technique.\nHinode observed a sunspot as it was crossing the limb, providing a unique side\non view of the sunspot atmosphere. The presence of large spicule-like jets is\nevident in \\ion{Ca}{II} H images. The jets are found to support transverse wave\nmotions that displace the central axis, which can be interpreted as a kink\nwave. The properties of a wave event are measured and used to determine the\nmagnetic and density stratification along the structure. We also measure the\nwidth of the spicule and the intensity profile along the structure. The\nmeasured wave properties reveal an initial rapid increase in amplitude with\nheight above the solar surface, followed by a decrease in amplitude. The MS\ninversion suggests this initial increase corresponds to large changes in\ndensity and magnetic field strength. In addition, we provide the first\nmeasurements of spicule width with height, which confirm that the spicule under\ngoes rapid expansion. The measured expansion shows good agreement with the\nresults from the MS. The observed variations in plasma parameters are suggested\nto be partly due to the presence of a gravitational stratified, ambient\natmosphere. Combining width measurements with phase speed measurements implies\nthe observed decrease in wave amplitude at greater heights can be explained by\nwave damping. Hence, we provide the first direct evidence of wave damping in\nchromospheric spicules and the quality factor of the damping is found to be\nsignificantly smaller than estimated coronal values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 15:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

One of the major reasons behind its partial acceptance is\nits security, as these features were incorporated in IPv6 just to enhance its\noverall performance and quality of service, thereby neglecting its security\npart. One such feature is Stateless Address Auto Configuration or simply SLAAC,\nwhich have undoubtedly reduced a lot of overhead in configuring networks, but\non the same time it has challenged the security of IPv6 networks. This research\nwork, therefore targets at proposing some security policies to mitigate the\nrisks associated with SLAAC, by understanding its working scenario and trying\nto create the possible attack vector to highlight its security concerns. Hence,\nthe implementation of these policies will directly add security to networks and\nmake them resistant to SLAAC based attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 09:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-19"}
