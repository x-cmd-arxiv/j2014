More generally: what is the topology of this space?\nFor example, what are its homotopy groups?\n  Higher index theory of the Dirac operator is the basic tool to address these\nquestions. This has seen tremendous development in recent years, and in this\nsurvey we will discuss some of the most pertinent examples.\n  In particular, we will show how advancements of large scale index theory\n(also called coarse index theory) give rise to new types of obstructions, and\nprovide the tools for a systematic study of the existence and classification\nproblem via the K-theory of C*-algebras. This is part of a program \"mapping the\ntopology of positive scalar curvature to analysis\".\n  In addition, we will show how advanced surgery theory and smoothing theory\ncan be used to construct the first elements of infinite order in the k-th\nhomotopy groups of the space of metrics of positive scalar curvature for\narbitrarily large k.

These parameters can be\ndetermined by measuring the quality factor Q0 of a SRF cavity in helium-baths\nof different temperatures. The surface resistance can be computed from Q0 for\nany cavity geometry, but it is not trivial to determine the temperature of the\nsurface when only the temperature of the helium bath is known.\n  Traditionally, it was approximated that the surface temperature on the inner\nsurface of the cavity was the same as the temperature of the helium bath. This\nis a good approximation at small RF-fields on the surface, but to determine the\nfield dependence of Rs, one cannot be restricted to small field losses.\n  Here we show the following: (1) How computer simulations can be used to\ndetermine the inside temperature Tin so that Rs(Tin) can then be used to\nextract the superconducting parameters. The computer code combines the\nwell-known programs, the HEAT code and the SRIMP code.

Applying our results to two\ndata sets from an observational study and a randomized experiment, we\ndemonstrate that the results can help us to draw conclusions about the signs of\nthe association measures between X and Z based only on two separate studies\nabout {X, Y} and {Y, Z}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 18:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-19"}

We report here on the detection of two-nucleon\nknock-out events from neutrino interactions and discuss their topological\nfeatures as possibly involving NN SRC content in the target argon nuclei. The\nArgoNeuT detector in the Main Injector neutrino beam at Fermilab has recorded a\nsample of 30 fully reconstructed charged current events where the leading muon\nis accompanied by a pair of protons at the interaction vertex, 19 of which have\nboth protons above the Fermi momentum of the Ar nucleus. Out of these 19\nevents, four are found with the two protons in a strictly back-to-back high\nmomenta configuration directly observed in the final state and can be\nassociated to nucleon Resonance pionless mechanisms involving a pre-existing\nshort range correlated np pair in the nucleus. Another fraction (four events)\nof the remaining 15 events have a reconstructed back-to-back configuration of a\nnp pair in the initial state, a signature compatible with one-body Quasi\nElastic interaction on a neutron in a SRC pair. The detection of these two\nsubsamples of the collected (mu- + 2p) events suggests that mechanisms directly\ninvolving nucleon-nucleon SRC pairs in the nucleus are active and can be\nefficiently explored in neutrino-argon interactions with the LAr TPC\ntechnology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 18:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

This paper focuses on reducing energy\nconsumption of Ethernet passive optical network (EPON) as one of the most\nefficient transmission technologies for broadband access. In EPON, the\ndownstream traffic is sent from the optical line terminal (OLT) located at the\ncentral office to all optical network units (ONUs). Each ONU checks all arrival\ndownstream packets and selects the downstream packets destined to itself.\nTherefore, receivers at ONUs have to always stay awake, thus consuming a large\namount of energy. Contrariwise, an ONU transmitter can be triggered by the\narrival of the upstream traffic and so it can go to the low power mode when no\ntraffic is observed. Putting ONUs into the low power mode during light traffic\nis a known strategy for energy saving. In this article, we address the\ndownstream challenge and also improve the ONU transmitter sleep time by\nproposing a simple sleep control scheme. We also propose an upstream and a\ndownstream sleep-aware traffic scheduling scheme to avoid missing the packets\nduring the sleep states. The proposed sleep control scheme does not need the\nhandshake process and is based on the mutual inference at OLT and ONU.\nSimulation results show that the proposed scheme can save energy as much as 60%\nwhen the network traffic is light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 19:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 May 2014 15:54:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2014 14:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-04"}

The same region is predominant in the NUHM, although the A-resonance\nregion is also present there as well as a new solution, of neutralino-stau\ncoannihilation through the channel stau stau -> hh at very large \\mu.

To understand this nature, it\nis essential to probe how the emergent phase nucleates, interacts and evolves\nwith the initial phase across the transition at microscopic scales. Here, the\nprototypical first-order magneto-structural transition in FeRh is used to\ninvestigate these phenomena. We find that the temperature evolution of the\nfinal phase exhibits critical behavior. Furthermore, a difference between the\nstructure and magnetic transition temperatures reveals a novel intermediate\nphase created from the interface between the initial and nucleated final\nstates. This emergent phase, characterized by its lack of spin order due to the\ncompetition between the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions, leads\nto suppression of the dynamic aspect of the transition, generating a static\nmixed-phase-morphology. Understanding and controlling the transition process at\nthis spatial scale is critical to optimizing functional device capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 21:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}

Cellular automata (CA) are a well-studied\napproach to exploring the principles underlying self-organization. A CA\ncomprises a lattice of cells whose states change over time based on a discrete\nupdate function. One challenge to developing CA is that the relationship of an\nupdate function, which describes the local behavior of each cell, to the global\nbehavior of the entire CA is often unclear. As a result, many researchers have\nused stochastic search techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms, to\nautomatically discover update functions that produce a desired global behavior.\nHowever, these update functions are typically defined in a way that does not\nprovide for self-adaptation. Here we describe an approach to discovering CA\nupdate functions that are both self-adaptive and self-organizing. Specifically,\nwe use a novel evolutionary algorithm-based approach to discover finite state\nmachines (FSMs) that implement update functions for CA. We show how this\napproach is able to evolve FSM-based update functions that perform well on the\ndensity classification task for 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional CA. Moreover, we show\nthat these FSMs are self-adaptive, self-organizing, and highly scalable, often\nperforming well on CA that are orders of magnitude larger than those used to\nevaluate performance during the evolutionary search. These results demonstrate\nthat CA are a viable platform for studying the integration of self-adaptation\nand self-organization, and strengthen the case for using evolutionary\nalgorithms as a component of SASO systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 22:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}

The $\\alpha$-stable distribution provides a\nflexible framework for modeling asymmetry and heavy tails, which is useful when\nmodeling financial returns. An issue with this distributional assumption is the\nlack of a closed form for the probability density function. To estimate the\nvolatility of financial returns in this setting, we develop a novel auxiliary\nparticle filter. The algorithm we develop can be easily applied to any hidden\nMarkov model for which the likelihood function is intractable or\ncomputationally expensive. The approximate target distribution of our auxiliary\nfilter is based on the idea of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). ABC\nmethods allow for inference on posterior quantities in situations when the\nlikelihood of the underlying model is not available in closed form, but\nsimulating samples from it is possible. The ABC auxiliary particle filter\n(ABC-APF) that we propose provides not only a good alternative to state\nestimation in stochastic volatility models, but it also improves on the\nexisting ABC literature. It allows for more flexibility in state estimation\nwhile improving on the accuracy through better proposal distributions in cases\nwhen the optimal importance density of the filter is unavailable in closed\nform. We assess the performance of the ABC-APF on a simulated dataset from the\n$\\alpha$-stable stochastic volatility model and compare it to other currently\nexisting ABC filters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 22:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}

These findings resolve the apparent contradiction between the\nHarris criterion which implies that weak disorder is renormalization-group\nirrelevant and the rare-region classification which predicts unconventional\nbehavior. We confirm and illustrate our theory by large-scale Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of systems with up to $70^5$ sites.

The first approach\nto combat fading is to utilize the existing optimal space-time codes.

In this paper, a novel protocol for wireless\nstorage transmissions based on algebraic space-time codes is presented in order\nto improve the system reliability while enabling feasible decoding. The\ndiversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff (DMT) of the system together with\nsphere-decodability even with low number of antennas are used as the main\ndesign criteria, thus naturally establishing a DMT-complexity tradeoff. It is\nshown that the proposed protocol outperforms the simple time-division multiple\naccess (TDMA) protocol, while still falling behind the optimal DMT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 May 2014 10:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}

To\nthis end, one usually departs from some notion of similarity, comparing two\nenzymes by looking for correspondences in their sequences, structures or\nsurfaces. For a given query, the search operation results in a ranking of the\nenzymes in the database, from very similar to dissimilar enzymes, while\ninformation about the biological function of annotated database enzymes is\nignored.\n  In this work we show that rankings of that kind can be substantially improved\nby applying kernel-based learning algorithms.

This is in contrast to\nsearch-based approaches, which do not take annotated training data into\naccount.

With a dense\ndeployment of access points, spatial reuse will be improved, and uniform\ncoverage can be provided. However, such performance gains cannot be achieved\nwithout effective intercell interference management. In this paper, a novel\ninterference coordination strategy, called user-centric intercell interference\nnulling, is proposed for small cell networks. A main merit of the proposed\nstrategy is its ability to effectively identify and mitigate the dominant\ninterference for each user. Different from existing works, each user selects\nthe coordinating base stations (BSs) based on the relative distance between the\nhome BS and the interfering BSs, called the interference nulling (IN) range,\nand thus interference nulling adapts to each user's own interference situation.\nBy adopting a random spatial network model, we derive an approximate expression\nof the successful transmission probability to the typical user, which is then\nused to determine the optimal IN range. Simulation results shall confirm the\ntightness of the approximation, and demonstrate significant performance gains\n(about 35%-40%) of the proposed coordination strategy, compared with the\nnon-coordination case. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed strategy\noutperforms other interference nulling methods. Finally, the effect of\nimperfect channel state information (CSI) is investigated, where CSI is assumed\nto be obtained via limited feedback. It is shown that the proposed coordination\nstrategy still provides significant performance gains even with a moderate\nnumber of feedback bits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 May 2014 13:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}

Among all motion estimation approaches, Block matching (BM)\nalgorithms are the most popular methods due to their effectiveness and\nsimplicity for both software and hardware implementations. A BM approach\nassumes that the movement of pixels within a defined region of the current\nframe (Macro-Block, MB) can be modeled as a translation of pixels contained in\nthe previous frame. In this procedure, the motion vector is obtained by\nminimizing the sum of absolute differences (SAD) produced by the MB of the\ncurrent frame over a determined search window from the previous frame. The SAD\nevaluation is computationally expensive and represents the most consuming\noperation in the BM process. The most straightforward BM method is the full\nsearch algorithm (FSA) which finds the most accurate motion vector, calculating\nexhaustively the SAD values for all elements of the search window. Over this\ndecade, several fast BM algorithms have been proposed to reduce the number of\nSAD operations by calculating only a fixed subset of search locations at the\nprice of a poor accuracy. In this paper, a new algorithm based on Differential\nEvolution (DE) is proposed to reduce the number of search locations in the BM\nprocess. In order to avoid computing several search locations, the algorithm\nestimates the SAD values (fitness) for some locations using the SAD values of\npreviously calculated neighboring positions. Since the proposed algorithm does\nnot consider any fixed search pattern or other different assumption, a high\nprobability for finding the true minimum (accurate motion vector) is expected.\nIn comparison to other fast BM algorithms, the proposed method deploys more\naccurate motion vectors yet delivering competitive time rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 19:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}

It is correlated with leaf area and\nbiomass of trees, and consequently gives a good estimate of the potential\nproduction of the plants. This work presents a low cost, high precision method\nfor the measurement of trunk diameter of grapevines based on Computer Vision\ntechniques. Several methods based on Computer Vision and other techniques are\nintroduced in the literature. These methods present different advantages for\ncrop management: they are amenable to be operated by unknowledgeable personnel,\nwith lower operational costs; they result in lower stress levels to\nknowledgeable personnel, avoiding the deterioration of the measurement quality\nover time; and they make the measurement process amenable to be embedded in\nlarger autonomous systems, allowing more measurements to be taken with\nequivalent costs. To date, all existing autonomous methods are either of low\nprecision, or have a prohibitive cost for massive agricultural adoption,\nleaving the manual Vernier caliper or tape measure as the only choice in most\nsituations. In this work we present a semi-autonomous measurement method that\nis susceptible to be fully automated, cost effective for mass adoption, and its\nprecision is competitive (with slight improvements) over the caliper manual\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 18:44:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 21:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}
