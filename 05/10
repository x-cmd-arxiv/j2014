We show that our method can be employed to track\nfeatures for both rigid and nonrigid motions (possibly of few moving bodies)\neven when some features are occluded. Furthermore, it can be used to\nsignificantly improve tracking results in poorly-lit scenes (where there is a\nmix of good and bad features). Our approach does not require direct modeling of\nthe structure or the motion of the scene, and runs in real time on a single CPU\ncore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 18:49:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-09"}

Since\ntheir inception, CCP-languages have been designed for having a strong\nconnection to logic. In fact, the underlying constraint system can be built\nfrom a suitable fragment of intuitionistic (linear) logic --ILL-- and processes\ncan be interpreted as formulas in ILL. Constraints as ILL formulas fail to\nrepresent accurately situations where \"preferences\" (called soft constraints)\nsuch as probabilities, uncertainty or fuzziness are present. In order to\ncircumvent this problem, c-semirings have been proposed as algebraic structures\nfor defining constraint systems where agents are allowed to tell and ask soft\nconstraints. Nevertheless, in this case, the tight connection to logic and\nproof theory is lost. In this work, we give a proof theoretical interpretation\nto soft constraints: they can be defined as formulas in a suitable fragment of\nILL with subexponentials (SELL) where subexponentials, ordered in a c-semiring\nstructure, are interpreted as preferences. We hence achieve two goals: (1)\nobtain a CCP language where agents can tell and ask soft constraints and (2)\nprove that the language in (1) has a strong connection with logic. Hence we\nkeep a declarative reading of processes as formulas while providing a logical\nframework for soft-CCP based systems.

However, there is still a debate about\ntheir stellar masses and their nature in the context of the general galaxy\npopulation. To test the reliability of their stellar mass determinations, we\nused a sample of simulated submm galaxies for which we derived stellar masses\nvia spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling (with Grasil, Magphys, Hyperz\nand LePhare) adopting various star formation histories (SFHs). We found that\nthe assumption of SFHs with two independent components leads to the most\naccurate stellar masses. Exponentially declining SFHs (tau) lead to lower\nmasses (albeit still consistent with the true values), while the assumption of\nsingle-burst SFHs results in a significant mass underestimation. Thus, we\nconclude that studies based on the higher masses inferred from fitting the SEDs\nof real submm galaxies with double SFHs are most likely to be correct, implying\nthat submm galaxies lie on the high-mass end of the main sequence of\nstar-forming galaxies. This conclusion appears robust to assumptions of whether\nor not submm galaxies are driven by major mergers, since the suite of simulated\ngalaxies modelled here contains examples of both merging and isolated galaxies.\nWe identified discrepancies between the true and inferred stellar ages (rather\nthan the dust attenuation) as the primary determinant of the success/failure of\nthe mass recovery. Regardless of the choice of SFH, the SED-derived stellar\nmasses exhibit a factor of ~2 scatter around the true value; this scatter is an\ninherent limitation of the SED modelling due to simplified assumptions.\nFinally, we found that the contribution of active galactic nuclei does not have\nany significant impact on the derived stellar masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 23:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

We have developed a new direct modeling approach for computing star\nformation rates that utilizes these data and population synthesis models to\nderive the masses and ages of the young stellar clusters associated with each\nof our HII region targets. We find a characteristic gas depletion time of 230\nMyr at 250 pc scales in NGC 300, more similar to the results obtained for Milky\nWay Giant Molecular Clouds than the longer (>2 Gyr) global depletion times\nderived for entire galaxies and kpc-sized regions within them. This difference\nis partially due to the fact that our study accounts for only the gas and stars\nwithin the youngest star forming regions. We also note a large scatter in the\nNGC 300 SFR-molecular gas mass scaling relation that is furthermore consistent\nwith the Milky Way cloud results. This scatter likely represents real\ndifferences in giant molecular cloud physical properties such as the dense gas\nfraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 20:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Here, we show theoretically that sub-Doppler-cooled,\ntwo-level atoms that are spatially organized by weak optical fields give rise\nto a nonlinear material response that is greatly enhanced beyond that\nattainable in a homogeneous gas. Specifically, in the regime where the\nintensity of the applied optical fields is much less than the off-resonant\nsaturation intensity, we show that the third-order nonlinear susceptibility\nscales inversely with atomic temperature and, due to this scaling, can be two\norders of magnitude larger than that of a homogeneous gas for typical\nexperimental parameters. As a result, we predict that spatially bunched\ntwo-level atoms can exhibit single-photon nonlinearities. Our model is valid\nfor all atomic temperature regimes and simultaneously accounts for the\nback-action of the atoms on the optical fields.

Secular dynamics controls its long term evolution with orbital\ncommensurability having negligible effect. Secular interactions transfer\nangular momentum between inner and outer orbits unless their apsidal lines are\nparallel or anti-parallel. These choices correspond, respectively, to\northogonal eigenmodes p and a. Each is characterized by an eccentricity ratio\nset by the masses and semi-major axes, i.e., $e_{p, 1}/e_{p, 2}\\sim a_1/a_2$\nwhile $e_{a, 1}/e_{a, 2}\\sim (a_1/a_2)^{-3/2}(m_2/m_1)$. Mode p dominates the\nsystem's current state so $e_1/e_2$ always remains close to $e_{p, 1}/e_{p,\n2}$. A small contribution by Mode a causes $e_1$ and $e_2$ to oscillate with\nperiod $\\sim 10^3\\,\\yr$. Orbital changes should be apparent in a few years.\nThese will reveal the forcing of the apsidal precession of the inner orbit by\ngeneral relativity (GR), and possibly also the smaller contribution due to the\ntidal and rotational distortion of the inner white dwarf (WD). Phinney (1992)\nproposes that the epicyclic energy of a WD-pulsar binary reaches equipartition\nwith the kinetic energy of a single convective eddy when the WD's progenitor\nfills its Roche lobe. We extend Phinney's theory to apply to modes rather than\nindividual orbits. Thus we predict that Mode p and Mode a achieved\nequipartition with eddies in the giant envelopes of the progenitors of the\nouter and inner WD, respectively. The most effective eddies are those with\nlifetimes closest to the orbit period. These were more energetic in the\nprogenitor of the outer WD. This explains why Mode p overwhelms Mode a, and\nalso why the inner binary's orbit is far more eccentric than other WD-pulsar\nbinaries with similar orbit periods. Mode a's small but finite amplitude places\na lower bound of $Q\\sim 10^6$ on the tidal quality parameter of the inner WD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 May 2014 01:26:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 16:54:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 21:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We demonstrate the development of two types of criticality, quantum\nand classical, and use their static and dynamic scaling properties to conclude\nthat quantum and thermal fluctuations can behave largely independently near a\nQCP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 May 2014 04:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-13"}

This type of distribution function in\nGalactic models is often constructed theoretically for comparison of the\nGalactic models with observational data as a test of the models. On the other\nhand, observations give Cartesian phase-space coordinates of stars. Therefore\nit is necessary to relate action variables and Cartesian coordinates in\ninvestigating whether the distribution function constructed in galaxy models\ncan explain observational data. Generating functions are very useful in\npractice for this purpose, because calculations of relations between action\nvariables and Cartesian coordinates by generating functions do not require a\nlot of computational time or computer memory in comparison with direct\nnumerical integration calculations of stellar orbits. Here, we propose a new\nmethod called a torus-fitting method, by which a generating function is derived\nnumerically for models of the Galactic potential in which almost all orbits are\nregular. We confirmed the torus-fitting method can be applied to major orbit\nfamilies (box and loop orbits) in some two-dimensional potentials. Furthermore,\nthe torus-fitting method is still applicable to resonant orbit families,\nbesides major orbit families. Hence the torus-fitting method is useful for\nanalyzing real Galactic systems in which a lot of resonant orbit families might\nexist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 May 2014 05:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

At the same time, the theoretical description of\nlight nuclei has made enormous progress, and properties of, e.g., the Helium\nisotopes can now be calculated {\\it ab initio}. These advances make those rare\nisotopes an ideal testing ground for effective field theories (EFTs) built upon\ncluster degrees of freedom.\n  Purpose: Systems with widely separated intrinsic scales are well suited to an\nEFT treatment. The Borromean halo nucleus $^6$He exhibits such a separation of\nscales. In this work an EFT in which the degrees of freedom are the valence\nneutrons ($n$) and an inert $^4$He-core ($\\alpha$) is employed. The properties\nof ${}^6$He can then be calculated using the momentum-space Faddeev equations\nfor the $\\alpha nn$ bound state to obtain information on ${}^6$He at leading\norder (LO) within the EFT.\n  Results: The $nn$ virtual state and the $^2$P$_{3/2}$ resonance in $^5$He\ngive the two-body amplitudes which are input to our LO three-body Halo EFT\ncalculation. We find that without a genuine three-body interaction the\ntwo-neutron separation energy $S_{2n}$ of ${}^6$He is strongly cutoff\ndependent. We introduce a $nn \\alpha$ \"three-body\" operator which renormalizes\nthe system, adjusting its coefficient to reproduce the $S_{2n}$ of $^6$He. The\nFaddeev components are then cutoff independent for cutoffs of the order of, and\nabove, the breakdown scale of the Halo EFT.\n  Conclusions: As in the case of a three-body system where only resonant s-wave\ninteractions are present, one three-body input is required for the\nrenormalization of the EFT equations that describe $^6$He at LO. However, in\ncontrast to the s-wave-only case, the running of the LO $nn\\alpha$ counterterm\ndoes not exhibit discrete scale invariance, due to the presence of the p-wave\n$n\\alpha$ interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 May 2014 05:32:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 19:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}

The number of donor hearts available currently is less than 3,000 per\nannum worldwide. Apart from the relatively fortunate people who receive donor\nhearts for transplant, the only alternative for people with HF is the\nimplantation of rotary blood pump (IRBP). In fact, an IRBP with its continuous\noperation requires a more complex controller to achieve basic physiological\nrequirements. The essential control requirement of an IRBP needs to mimic the\nway that the heart pumps as much blood to the arterial circulation as it\nreceives from the venous circulation. This research aims to design, develop and\nimplement novel control strategies combining sensorless and non-invasive data\nmeasurements to provide an adaptive and fairly robust preload sensitive\ncontroller for IRBPs subjected to varying patient conditions, model\nuncertainties and external disturbances. A sensorless pulastile flow estimator\nwas developed using collected data from animal experiments. Based on this\nestimator, advanced physiological control algorithms for regulation of an IRBP\nwere developed to automatically adjust the pump speed to cater for changes in\nthe metabolic demand.The performance of the developed control algorithms are\nassessed using a lumped parameter model of the CVS that was previously\ndeveloped using actual data from healthy pigs over a wide range of operating\nconditions. Immediate responses of the controllers to short-term circulatory\nchanges as well as adaptive characteristics of the controllers in response to\nlong-term changes are examined in a parameter-optimised model of CVS - IRBP\ninteractions. Simulation results prove that the proposed controllers are fairly\nrobust against model uncertainties, parameter variations and external\ndisturbances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 May 2014 11:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-13"}

It applies nonetheless to many\nother systems where primary prey have fast life-histories and can become\nlocally superabundant, which facilitates impact on alternative prey species. In\ncontrast to classic apparent competition theory based on symmetric\ninteractions, our results suggest that predator effects on alternative prey\nshould generally decrease with mean primary prey abundance, and increase with\nprimary prey variability (low to high CV) - unless predators have strong\naggregative responses, in which case these results can be reversed.\nApproximations of models including predator dynamics (general numerical\nresponse with possible delays) confirm these results but further suggest that\nnegative temporal correlation between predator and primary prey is harmful to\nalternative prey.

The investigation of computability in this\nmodel, initially suggested by Peleg, is under way, and several results have\nbeen recently established. In these investigations, however, an agent is\nassumed to be capable to see through another agent. In this paper we start the\nstudy of computing when visibility is obstructable, and investigate the most\nbasic problem for this setting, Complete Visibility: The agents must reach\nwithin finite time a configuration where they can all see each other and\nterminate. We do not make any assumption on a-priori knowledge of the number of\nagents, on rigidity of movements nor on chirality. The local coordinate system\nof an agent may change at each activation. Also, by definition of lights, an\nagent can communicate and remember only a constant number of bits in each\ncycle. In spite of these weak conditions, we prove that Complete Visibility is\nalways solvable, even in the asynchronous setting, without collisions and using\na small constant number of colors. The proof is constructive. We also show how\nto extend our protocol for Complete Visibility so that, with the same number of\ncolors, the agents solve the (non-uniform) Circle Formation problem with\nobstructed visibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 May 2014 13:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-13"}

In this work, we present a simple and efficient lock-free design where\nboth levels of the tries can be shared among threads in a concurrent\nenvironment. To implement lock-freedom we took advantage of the CAS atomic\ninstruction that nowadays can be widely found on many common architectures. CAS\nreduces the granularity of the synchronization when threads access concurrent\nareas, but still suffers from low-level problems such as false sharing or cache\nmemory side-effects. In order to be as effective as possible in the concurrent\nsearch and insert operations over the table space data structures, we based our\ndesign on a hash trie data structure in such a way that it minimizes potential\nlow-level synchronization problems by dispersing as much as possible the\nconcurrent areas. Experimental results in the Yap Prolog system show that our\nnew lock-free hash trie design can effectively reduce the execution time and\nscale better than previous designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 19:19:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 17:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}

This paper shows how the universals of category theory in mathematics\nprovide a model (in the Platonic Heaven of mathematics) for the\nself-predicative strand of Plato's Theory of Forms as well as for the idea of a\n\"concrete universal\" in Hegel and similar ideas of paradigmatic exemplars in\nordinary thought. 2. The paper also shows how the always-self-predicative\nuniversals of category theory provide the \"opposite bookend\" to the\nnever-self-predicative universals of iterative set theory and thus that the\nparadoxes arose from having one theory (e.g., Frege's Paradise) where\nuniversals could be either self-predicative or non-self-predicative (instead of\nbeing always one or the other). 3. Moreover the paper considers one of the most\nimportant examples of self-predicative universals in pure mathematics, namely\nadjoint functors or adjunctions. It gives a parsing of adjunctions into two\nhalves (left and right semi-adjunctions) using the heterodox notion of\nheteromorphisms, and then shows that the parts can be recombined in a new way\nto define the cognate-to-adjoints notion of a brain functor that provides an\nabstract conceptual model of a brain. 4. Finally the paper argues that at least\none way category theory has foundational relevance is that it isolates the\nuniversal concepts and structures that are important throughout mathematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 May 2014 23:25:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 17:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-12"}

In order to determine the\nnature of the emission and the physical characteristics in the source region,\nwe have made multi-epoch, wideband spectral observations of TVLM 0513-46 and 2M\n0746+20. We combine these observations with archival radio data to fully\ncharacterize both the temporal and spectral properties of the radio emission.\nThe continuum spectral energy distribution can be well modeled using\ngyrosynchrotron emission from mildly relativistic electrons in a dipolar field.\nThe pulsed emission exhibits a variety of time-variable characteristics,\nincluding frequency drifts, frequency cutoffs, and multiple pulses per period.\nFor 2M 0746+20 we determine a pulse period consistent with previously\ndetermined values. We modeled locations of pulsed emission using an oblique\nrotating magnetospheric model with beamed electron cyclotron maser (ECM)\nsources. The best-fit models have narrow ECM beaming angles aligned with the\nlocal source magnetic field direction, except for one isolated burst from 2M\n0746+20. For TVLM 0513-46, the best-fit rotation axis inclination is nearly\northogonal to the line of sight. For 2M 0746+20 we found a good fit using a\nfixed inclination i=36 deg, determined from optical observations. For both\nstars the ECM sources are located near feet of magnetic loops with radial\nextents 1.2Rs-2.7 Rs and surface fields 2.2 - 2.5 kG.
