The environment of the EBIT allows for the detection\nof low-energy photons by providing backing-free storage of the radioactive\nions, while guiding charged decay particles away from the trap centre via the\nstrong (up to 6 T) magnetic field. In addition to excellent ion confinement and\nstorage, the EBIT also provides a venue for performing decay spectroscopy on\nhighly-charged radioactive ions. Recent technical advancements have been able\nto provide a significant increase in sensitivity for low-energy photon\ndetection, towards the goal of measuring weak electron-capture branching ratios\nof the intermediate nuclei in the two-neutrino double beta ($2\\nu\\beta\\beta$)\ndecay process.

From the Ks image we obtain a new measure of the\ndeprojected length of the bar of 2.5 kpc. The bar's strength, as derived from\nthe curvature of the dust lanes in the J-Ks image, is typical of weak bars.\nFrom the deprojected length of the bar, we establish the corotation radius\n(R_CR=3 kpc) and bar pattern speed (Omega_b = 61.3 km /s kpc), which provides\nthe connection between the high-frequency structures in the disk and the\norbital resonances induced by the bar. The nuclear ring is located at the inner\nLindblad resonance. The second ring does not have a resonant origin, but it\ncould be a merger remnant or a transient structure formed during an\nintermediate stage of the bar formation.

In such systems, the real-time\nscheduling problem becomes more challenging in that processors have different\nspeeds. A job executing on a processor with speed $x$ for $t$ time units\ncompletes $(x \\cdot t)$ units of execution. Prior research on heterogeneous\nmultiprocessor real-time scheduling has focused on hard real-time systems,\nwhere, significant processing capacity may have to be sacrificed in the\nworst-case to ensure that all deadlines are met. As meeting hard deadlines is\noverkill for many soft real-time systems in practice, this paper shows that on\nsoft real-time heterogeneous multiprocessors, bounded response times can be\nensured for globally-scheduled sporadic task systems with no utilization loss.\nA GEDF-based scheduling algorithm, namely GEDF-H, is presented and response\ntime bounds are established under both preemptive and non-preemptive GEDF-H\nscheduling. Extensive experiments show that the magnitude of the derived\nresponse time bound is reasonable, often smaller than three task periods. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to show that soft real-time\nsporadic task systems can be supported on heterogeneous multiprocessors without\nutilization loss, and with reasonable predicted response time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 18:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-29"}

We estimate\nthe depth of such a precursor under conditions of nonresonant amplification,\nwhich can provide magnetic field strengths comparable to those inferred for\nsupernova remnants. Magnetic field generation occurs as the streaming cosmic\nrays induce a plasma return current, and may be quenched either by nonresonant\nor resonant channels. In the case of nonresonant saturation, the cosmic rays\nbecome magnetized and amplification saturates at higher magnetic fields. The\nprecursor can extend out to $10^{17} - 10^{18}$ cm and is potentially\ndetectable. If resonant saturation occurs, the cosmic rays are scattered by\nturbulence and the precursor length will likely be much smaller.\n  The dependence of precursor length on shock velocity has implications for\nelectron heating. In the case of resonant saturation, this dependence is\nsimilar to that in the more familiar resonantly generated shock precursor,\nwhich when expressed in terms of the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient\n$\\varkappa $ and shock velocity $v_s$ is $\\varkappa /v_s$. In the nonresonantly\nsaturated case, the precursor length declines less quickly with increasing\n$v_s$.

The gas flow nonuniformity in the\nshock vicinity is described by the space derivatives of the gasdynamic\nparameters at a point on the shock surface. The parameters are the gas\npressure, density, velocity vector. The derivatives with respect to the\ndirections of the streamline and normal to it, and of the shock surface and\nnormal to it are considered. Space derivatives of all gasdynamic parameters are\nexpressed through the flow nonisobaric factor along the streamline, the\nstreamline curvature, and the flow vorticity and non-isoenthalpy factors.

Motivated by the\nprofound importance of the discovery of gravitational waves from the early\nUniverse, we examine to what extent a combination of Galactic foregrounds and\nlensed E-modes could be responsible for the signal. We reanalyze the BICEP2\nresults and show that the 100x150 GHz and 150x150 GHz data are consistent with\na cosmology with r=0.2 and negligible foregrounds, but also with a cosmology\nwith r=0 and a significant dust polarization signal. We give independent\nestimates of the dust polarization signal in the BICEP2 region using four\ndifferent approaches. While these approaches are consistent with each other,\nthe expected amplitude of the dust polarization power spectrum remains\nuncertain by about a factor of three. The lower end of the prediction leaves\nroom for a primordial contribution, but at the higher end the dust in\ncombination with the standard CMB lensing signal could account for the BICEP2\nobservations, without requiring the existence of primordial gravitational\nwaves. By measuring the cross-correlations between the pre-Planck templates\nused in the BICEP2 analysis and between different versions of a data-based\ntemplate, we emphasize that cross-correlations between models are very\nsensitive to noise in the polarization angles and that measured\ncross-correlations are likely underestimates of the contribution of foregrounds\nto the map. These results suggest that BICEP1 and BICEP2 data alone cannot\ndistinguish between foregrounds and a primordial gravitational wave signal, and\nthat future Keck Array observations at 100 GHz and Planck observations at\nhigher frequencies will be crucial to determine whether the signal is of\nprimordial origin.

This finding is based on number\ndensity maps for stellar populations found in data gathered by OGLE-IV, that\nfully cover over 270 deg^2 of the sky in the Magellanic Bridge area. This is\nthe most extensive optical survey of this region up to date. We find that the\nyoung population is present mainly in the western half of the MBR, which,\ntogether with the newly discovered young population in the eastern Bridge, form\na continuous stream of stars connecting both galaxies along Dec ~ -73.5 deg.\nThe young population distribution is clumped, with one of the major densities\nclose to the SMC, and the other, fairly isolated and located approximately\nmid-way between the Clouds, which we call the OGLE island. These overdensities\nare well matched by HI surface density contours, although the newly found young\npopulation in the eastern Bridge is offset by ~2 deg north from the highest HI\ndensity contour. We observe a continuity of red clump stars between the\nMagellanic Clouds, which represent an intermediate-age population. Red clump\nstars are present mainly in the southern and central parts of the Magellanic\nBridge, below its gaseous part, and their presence is reflected by a strong\ndeviation from the radial density profiles of the two galaxies. This may\nindicate either a tidal stream of stars, or that the stellar halos of the two\ngalaxies overlap. On the other hand, we do not observe such an overlap within\nan intermediate-age population represented by the top of the red giant branch\nand the asymptotic giant branch stars. We also see only minor mixing of the old\npopulations of the Clouds in the southern part of the Bridge, represented by\nthe lowest part of the red giant branch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 16:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Based on these calculations, we\npropose a novel explanation for the increased prevalence of carbon-enhanced\nmetal-poor (CEMP) stars with decreasing Fe abundance: The observed chemistry\nfor the most metal-poor Galactic halo stars is the result of an intimate link\nbetween the explosions of the first stars and their host minihalo's ability to\nretain its gas. Specifically, high-energy supernovae produce a near solar ratio\nof C/Fe, but are effective in evacuating the gas from their host minihalo,\nthereby suppressing the formation of a second generation of stars. On the other\nhand, minihalos that host low-energy supernovae are able to retain their gas\nand form a second stellar generation but, as a result, the second stars are\nborn with a supersolar ratio of C/Fe. Our models are able to accurately\nreproduce the observed distributions of [C/Fe] and [Fe/H], as well as the\nfraction of CEMP stars relative to non-CEMP stars as a function of [Fe/H]\nwithout any free parameters. We propose that the present lack of chemical\nevidence for very massive stars (>140 Msun), that ended their lives as a highly\nenergetic pair-instability supernova, does not imply that such stars were rare\nor did not exist; the chemical products of these very massive first stars may\nhave escaped from their host minihalo, and were never incorporated into\nsubsequent generations of stars. Finally, our models suggest that the most\nFe-poor stars currently known may have seen the enrichment from a small\nmultiple of metal-free stars, and need not have been exclusively enriched by a\nsolitary first star. These calculations support the idea that some of the\nsurviving dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way are relics of the first\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 20:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 06:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

As a proof of concept, we present a model of two-component thermal\nrelic DM, where the dominant heavy DM species has no tree-level interactions\nwith the standard model and thus largely evades direct and indirect DM bounds.\nInstead, its thermal relic abundance is set by annihilation into a subdominant\nlighter DM species, and the latter can be detected in the boosted channel via\nthe same annihilation process occurring today.

Such a cosmology could arise naturally in the well-motivated moduli\nscenario in the context of supersymmetry (SUSY) -- in particular in models of\nSplit-SUSY. Sub-horizon dark matter perturbations grow linearly during the\nmatter dominated phase before reheating and can lead to an enhancement in the\ngrowth of substructure on small scales, even in the presence of dark matter\nannihilations. This suggests that a new scale (the horizon size at reheating)\ncould be important for determining the primordial matter power spectrum.\nHowever, we find that in many non-thermal models free-streaming effects or\nkinetic decoupling after reheating can completely erase the enhancement leading\nto small-scale structures. In particular, in the moduli scenario with wino or\nhiggsino dark matter we find that the dark matter particles produced from\nmoduli decays would thermalize with radiation and kinetically decouple below\nthe reheating temperature. Thus, the growth of dark matter perturbations is not\nsustained, and the predictions for the matter power spectrum are similar to a\nstandard thermal history. We comment on possible exceptions, but these appear\ndifficult to realize within standard moduli scenarios. We conclude that\nalthough enhanced structure does not provide a new probe for investigating the\ncosmic dark ages within these models, it does suggest that non-thermal\nhistories offer a robust alternative to a strictly thermal post-inflationary\nhistory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 20:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 18:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

The analysis of the spectrum, together with\nconstraints provided by the SED fitting, the distance to the star (140 +- 20\npc) and the use of evolutionary tracks and isochrones, lead to the following\nset of parameters T_eff = 6550 +- 100 K, log g = 3.75 +- 0.10, L_*/L_sun = 16.3\n+- 4.5, M_*/M_sun = 2.0 +- 0.3 and an age of 5.0 +- 1.5 Myr. This stellar age\nprovides further constrains to the mass of the possible companion estimated by\nBiller et al. (2012), being in-between 0.20 and 0.35 M_sun. Stellar accretion\nrates obtained from UV Balmer excess modelling, optical photospheric line\nveiling, and from the correlations with several emission lines spanning from\nthe UV to the near-IR, are consistent to each other. The mean value from all\nprevious tracers is 2 (+- 1) x 10^-7 M_sun yr^-1, which is within the upper\nlimit gas flow rate from the outer to the inner disk recently provided by\nCassasus et al. (2013). This suggests that almost all gas transferred between\nboth components of the disk is not trapped by the possible planet(s) in-between\nbut fall onto the central star, although it is discussed how the gap flow rate\ncould be larger than previously suggested. In addition, we provide evidence\nshowing that the stellar accretion rate of HD 142527 has increased by a factor\n~ 7 on a timescale of 2-5 years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 20:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-08"}

This conjecture is motivated by a\ngeneralization to strings of the rule for computing anomalous dimensions of\nmassive particles and supergravity fields in the anti-de Sitter space. We show\nthat this proportionality holds for a rotating closed string in global AdS\nspace, representing a high spin operator made of fields in the adjoint\nrepresentation. It is also valid for closed strings rotating in $S^5$\n(representing operators with large R-charge), for closed strings with multiple\nAdS spin, and for giant magnons. Based on this conjecture, we calculate the\nanomalous dimension $\\delta$ of operators made of fields in the fundamental\nrepresentation, associated with high spin mesons, and which are represented by\nrotating open strings attached to probe D7-branes. The result is a logarithmic\ndependence upon the spin, $\\delta\\sim \\sqrt{\\lambda}\\ln S$, similar to the\nclosed string case. We show that the operator properties --- anomalous\ndimension and spin --- are obtained from measurements made by a local observer\nin the anti-de Sitter space. For the open string case, this ensures that these\nquantities are independent of the mass scale introduced by the D7-branes (the\nquark mass), as expected on physical grounds. In contrast, properties of the\ngauge theory states, like the energy, correspond to measurements by a gauge\ntheory observer and depend upon the mass scale --- once again, as expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 20:16:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 02:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

This nonlinear PDE must be solved\nbackwards in time, and this computation is intractable for large scale systems.\nUnder certain assumptions, and after applying a logarithmic transformation, an\nalternative characterization of the optimal policy can be given in terms of a\npath integral.

One of the implementation challenges with this formalism is\nthe computation of the expectation of a cost functional over the trajectories\nof the unforced dynamics.

Based on this\naccounting identified organics created by the chemistry of star formation could\ncontain at most ~15% of the organic carbon content in primitive meteorites and\nsignificantly less for cometary organics, which represent the putative\ncontributors to starting materials for the Earth. In the ISM ~30% of the\nelemental carbon is found in CO, either in the gas or ices, with a typical\nabundance of ~10^-4 (relative to H2). Recent observations of the TW Hya disk\nfind that the gas phase abundance of CO is reduced by an order of magnitude\ncompared to this value. We explore a solution where the volatile CO is\ndestroyed via a gas phase processes, providing an additional source of carbon\nfor organic material to be incorporated into planetesimals and cometesimals.\nThis chemical processing mechanism requires warm grains (> 20 K), partially\nionized gas, and sufficiently small <10 micron grains, i.e. a larger total\ngrain surface area, such that freeze-out is efficient. Under these conditions\nstatic (non-turbulent) chemical models predict that a large fraction of the\ncarbon nominally sequestered in CO can be the source of carbon for a wide\nvariety of organics that are present as ice coatings on the surfaces of warm\npre-planetesimal dust grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 21:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

GRB 120711A was at z~1.405 and produced soft gamma-ray\nemission (>20 keV) for at least ~10 ks after the trigger. The GRB was observed\nby several ground-based telescopes that detected a powerful optical flash\npeaking at an R-band brightness of ~11.5 mag at ~126 s after the trigger. We\npresent a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the long-lasting soft\ngamma-ray emission detected in the 20-200 keV band with INTEGRAL, the Fermi/LAT\npost-GRB detection above 100 MeV, the soft X-ray afterglow from XMM-Newton,\nChandra, and Swift and the optical/NIR detections from Watcher, Skynet, GROND,\nand REM. We modelled the long-lasting soft gamma-ray emission using the\nstandard afterglow scenario, which indicates a forward shock origin. The\ncombination of data extending from the NIR to GeV energies suggest that the\nemission is produced by a broken power-law spectrum consistent with synchrotron\nradiation. The afterglow is well modelled using a stratified wind-like\nenvironment with a density profile k~1.2, suggesting a massive star progenitor\n(i.e. Wolf-Rayet). The analysis of the reverse and forward shock emission\nreveals an initial Lorentz factor of ~120-340, a jet half-opening angle of\n~2deg-5deg, and a baryon load of ~10^-5-10^-6 Msun consistent with the\nexpectations of the fireball model when the emission is highly relativistic.\nLong-lasting soft gamma-ray emission from other INTEGRAL GRBs with high peak\nfluxes, such as GRB 041219A, was not detected, suggesting that a combination of\nhigh Lorentz factor, emission above 100 MeV, and possibly a powerful reverse\nshock are required.

High-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging of\nthese objects reveals the presence of large star forming clumps in the bodies\nof the galaxies, while spatially resolved spectroscopy of redshifted Halpha\nreveals the presence of high dispersion rotating disks. The internal dynamical\nstate of these galaxies resembles that of disk systems seen at much higher\nredshifts (1 < z < 3). Using CO(1-0) observations made with the Plateau de Bure\nInterferometer, we find gas fractions of 20-30% and depletion times of tdep ~\n0.5 Gyr (assuming a Milky Way-like CO conversion factor). These properties are\nunlike those expected for low- redshift galaxies of comparable specific star\nformation rate, but they are normal for their high-z counterparts. DYNAMO\ngalaxies break the degeneracy between gas fraction and redshift, and we show\nthat the depletion time per specific star formation rate for galaxies is\nclosely tied to gas fraction, independent of redshift. We also show that the\ngas dynamics of two of our local targets corresponds to those expected from\nunstable disks, again resembling the dynamics of high-z disks. These results\nprovide evidence that DYNAMO galaxies are local analogues to the clumpy,\nturbulent disks, which are often found at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 22:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In our model, we use logarithmic and sigmoidal-like utility\nfunctions to represent the users applications running on different user\nequipments (UE)s.

Our\nobjective is to allocate the resources to the users with priority given to the\nadaptive real-time application users.

However, it is not rigorously applicable when plastic unloading\nappears during crack propagation. One difficulty is that the energy density\nwith plastic unloading in J integral cannot be defined unambiguously. In this\npaper, we alternatively start from the analysis on the power balance, and\npropose a surface-forming energy release rate (ERR), which represents the\nenergy directly dissipated on the surface-forming during the crack propagation\nand excludes the loading-mode-dependent plastic dissipation. Therefore the\nsurface-forming ERR based fracture criterion has wider applicability, including\nelastic-plastic crack propagation problems. Several formulae have been derived\nfor calculating the surface-forming ERR. From the most concise formula, it is\ninteresting to note that the surface-forming ERR can be computed only by the\nstress and deformation of the current moment, and the definition of the energy\ndensity or work density is avoided. When an infinitesimal contour is chosen,\nthe expression can be further simplified. For any fracture behaviors, the\nsurface-forming ERR is proven to be path-independent, and the path-independence\nof its constituent term, so-called integral, is also investigated.

However, to understand MHD dynamo the\nfeatures of helical and nonhelical magnetic field should be made clear. For\nthis, we made a detour: we gave each simulation set its own initial condition\n($IC$, same $E_M$(0) and specific $H_M$(0) at $k_f=5$), and then drove the\nsystem with positive helical kinetic energy($k_f=5$). According to the\nsimulation results, $E_M$(0), whether or not helical, increases the growth rate\nof $\\overline{{\\bf B}}$. The positive $H_M$(0) boosts the increased growth\nrate, but the negative $H_M$(0) decreases it. To explain these results two\ncoupled equations of $H_M$ and $E_M$ were derived and solved using a simple\napproximate method. The equations imply that helical magnetic field generates\nthe whole (helical and nonhelical) magnetic field but quenches itself.\nNonhelical magnetic field also generates the whole magnetic field but quenches\nitself. The initially given $E_M$(0) modifies the electromotive force ($\\langle\n{\\bf v}{\\bf \\times} {\\bf b}\\rangle$, $EMF$) and generates new terms. The\neffects of these terms depend on the magnetic diffusivity $\\eta$, position of\ninitial conditions $k_f$, and time.

The cluster is a highly massive, strong cool core\ncluster. We find that the ICM entropy around the quasar is significantly lower\nthan that of other similarly massive strong cool core clusters within the\ncentral 80 kpc, and that the entropy lies significantly below the extrapolated\nbaseline entropy profile from hierarchical structure formation. By comparing\nthe scaled temperature profile with those of other strong cool core clusters of\nsimilar total mass, we see that the entropy deficiency is due to the central\ntemperature being significantly lower. This suggests that the presence of the\nquasar in the core of H1821+643 has had a dramatic cooling effect on the\nintracluster medium around it. We find that, if the quasar was brighter in the\npast, Compton cooling by radiation from the quasar may have caused the low\nentropy and temperature levels in the ICM around the quasar. Curiously, the\ngradients of the steep central temperature and entropy decline are in\nreasonable agreement with the profiles expected for a constant pressure cooling\nflow. It is possible that the system has been locked into a Compton cooled\nfeedback cycle which prevents energy release from the black hole heating the\ngas sufficiently to switch it off, leading to the formation of a huge (~3x10^10\nsolar mass) supermassive black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 11:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The approach we\nfollow, has two main components: the Dynkin's characterization of the value\nfunction as the smallest excessive function dominating the reward; and the\nRiesz representation of excessive functions in terms of the Green kernel, the\nmain reference being Salminen 85. In the context of one-dimensional diffusions\nwe give a complete characterization of the solution under some assumptions on\nthe reward function. If the optimal stopping problem is a ray, we provide a\nsimple equation to find the boundary and discuss the validity of the smooth fit\nprinciple. We include some new examples as the optimal stopping of the skew\nBrownian motion and the sticky Brownian motion. In particular, we consider\ncases in which the smooth fit principle fails. In the general case, we propose\nan algorithm that finds the optimal stopping region when it is a disjoint union\nof intervals. We also give a simple formula for the value function. Using this\nalgorithm we solve some examples including polynomial rewards. For general\nMarkov processes with continuous sample paths (for instance multidimensional\ndiffusions) we provide a verification theorem and use it to solve a particular\nproblem. Finally we consider one-dimensional strong Markov processes with only\npositive (or only negative) jumps, and provide another verification theorem for\nright-sided (left-sided) problems. As applications of our results we address\nthe problem of pricing an American put option in a L\\'evy market, and also\nsolve an optimal stopping problem for a L\\'evy driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 12:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-30"}

In this work we study the characteristics of the\nnarrow Fe K$\\alpha$ line in different types of AGN. Using the results of a\nlarge Suzaku study we find that Seyfert 2s have on average lower Fe K$\\alpha$\nluminosities than Seyfert 1s for the same 10-50 keV continuum luminosity.\nSimulating dummy Sy1s and Sy2s populations using physical torus models of X-ray\nreflected emission, we find that this difference can be explained by means of\ndifferent average inclination angles with respect to the torus, as predicted by\nthe unified model. Alternative explanations include differences in the\nintensities of Compton humps or in the photon index distributions. We show that\nthe ratio between the flux of the broad and narrow Fe K$\\alpha$ line in the\n6.35-6.45 keV range depends on the torus geometry considered, and is on average\n$<25\\%$ and $<15\\%$ for type I and type II AGN, respectively. We find evidence\nof absorption of the narrow Fe K$\\alpha$ line flux in Compton-thick AGN, which\nsuggests that part of the reflecting material is obscured. We estimate that on\naverage in obscured AGN the reflected radiation from neutral material is seen\nthrough a column density which is 1/4 of that absorbing the primary X-ray\nemission. This should be taken into account in synthesis models of the CXB and\nwhen studying the luminosity function of heavily obscured AGN. We detect the\nfirst evidence of the X-ray Baldwin effect in Seyfert 2s, with the same slope\nas that found for Seyfert 1s, which suggests that the mechanism responsible for\nthe decrease of the equivalent width with the continuum luminosity is the same\nin the two classes of objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 14:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Ever growing\nobservational data indicate the existence of correlations between the\nproperties of these very dense central star aggregates and those of host\ngalaxies, which constitute a significant constraint for the validity of\ntheoretical models of their origin and formation. In the framework of the well\nknown 'migratory and merger' model for NSC and SN formation, in this paper we\nobtain, first, by a simple argument the expected scaling of the NSC/SN mass\nwith both time and parent galaxy velocity dispersion in the case of dynamical\nfriction as dominant effect on the globular cluster system evolution. This\ngeneralizes previous results by \\cite{TrOsSp} and is in good agreement with\navailable observational data showing a shallow correlation between NSC/SN mass\nand galactic bulge velocity dispersion. Moreover, we give statistical relevance\nto predictions of this formation model, obtaining a set of parameters to\ncorrelate with the galactic host parameters. We find that the correlations\nbetween the masses of NSCs in the migratory model and the global properties of\nthe hosts reproduce quite well the observed correlations, supporting the\nvalidity of the migratory-merger model. In particular, one important result is\nthe flattening or even decrease of the value of the NSC/SN mass obtained by the\nmerger model as function of the galaxy mass for high values of the galactic\nmass, i.e. $\\gtrsim 3\\times 10^{11}$M$_\\odot$, in agreement with some growing\nobservational evidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 15:52:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 08:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-22"}

The\nfreedom available in assigning these gauges is exploited here by defining them\nin terms of the configuration, and interactions of the observing system with\nthe observed one.

The model is expressed by a system of several nonlinear\ndifferential equations which involve parameters defined by probabilities.\nSociety is described as an ensemble of individuals divided into income classes;\nthe individuals exchange money through binary and ternary interactions, leaving\nthe total wealth unchanged. The ternary interactions represent taxation and\nredistribution effects. Dynamics is investigated through computational\nsimulations, the focus being on the effects that different fiscal policies and\ndifferently weighted welfare policies have on the long-run income\ndistributions. The model provides a tool which may contribute to the\nidentification of the most effective actions towards a reduction of economic\ninequality. We find for instance that, under certain hypotheses, the Gini index\nis more affected by a policy of reduction of the welfare and subsidies for the\nrich classes than by an increase of the upper tax rate. Such a policy also has\nthe effect of slightly increasing the total tax revenue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 14:48:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 10:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

The security of a wireless sensor network is\ncompromised because of the random deployment of sensor nodes in open\nenvironment, memory limitations, power limitations and unattended nature. This\npaper focuses on various attacks that manifest in the network and provides a\ntabular representation of the attacks, their effects and severity. The paper\ndepicts a comparison of attacks basis packet loss and packet corruption.

These transitions together\nwith classical solutions of the Dirac equation testify in favor of the\nunidenticality of masses, energies, and momenta of neutrinos of the different\ncomponents. If we recognize such a difference in masses, energies, and momenta,\naccepting its ideas about that the left-handed neutrino and the right-handed\nantineutrino refer to long-lived leptons, and the right-handed neutrino and the\nleft-handed antineutrino are short-lived fermions, we would follow the\nmathematical logic of the Dirac equation in the presence of the flavor\nsymmetrical mass, energy, and momentum matrices. From their point of view,\nnature itself separates Minkowski space into left and right spaces concerning a\ncertain middle dynamical line. Thereby, it characterizes any Dirac particle\nboth by left and by right space-time coordinates. It is not excluded therefore\nthat whatever the main purposes each of earlier experiments about sterile\nneutrinos, namely, about right-handed short-lived neutrinos may serve as the\nsource of facts confirming the existence of a mirror Minkowski space-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 02:59:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 03:02:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2015 03:01:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 04:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}
