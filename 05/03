MAS admits a 2\napproximation, and this approximation is optimal under the Unique Game\nConjecture.\n  In this paper we consider a generalization of MAS, the Restricted Maximum\nAcyclic Subgraph problem (RMAS), where each node is associated with a list of\ninteger labels, and we have to find a labeling of the nodes so as to maximize\nthe weight of edges whose head label is larger than the tail label. The best\nknown (almost trivial) approximation for RMAS is 4.\n  The interest of RMAS is mostly due to its connections with the Vertex Pricing\nproblem (VP). In VP we are given an undirected graph with positive edge\nbudgets. A feasible solution consists of an assignment of non-negative prices\nto the nodes. The profit for each edge $e$ is the sum of its endpoints prices\nif that sum is at most the budget of $e$, and zero otherwise. Our goal is to\nmaximize the total profit. The best known approximation for VP, which works\nanalogously to the mentioned approximation algorithm for RMAS, is 4. Improving\non that is a challenging open problem.

High-energy gamma-ray measurements indicate\nhadronic acceleration binary systems, leading to both periodic gamma-ray\nemission from binaries like LSI+60~303 and continuous emission from colliding\nwind environments like Eta Carinae. The detection of neutrinos and photons from\nhadronic interactions are one of the most promising methods to identify\nparticle acceleration sites. In this paper, future prospects to detect\nneutrinos from colliding wind environments in massive stars are investigated.\nIn particular, the seven most promising candidates for emission from colliding\nwind binaries are investigated to provide an estimate of the signal strength.\nThe expected signal of a single source is about a factor of $5-10$ below the\ncurrent IceCube sensitivity and it is therefore not accessible at the moment.\nWhat is discussed in addition is future the possibility to measure low-energy\nneutrino sources with detectors like PINGU and ORCA: the minimum of the\natmospheric neutrino flux at around 25 GeV from neutrino oscillations provides\nan opportunity to reduce the background and increase the significance to\nsearches for GeV/TeV neutrino sources.

To investigate the energetics of strong dsDNA\nbending, we measured the opening rate of small dsDNA loops with contour lengths\nof 40-200 bp using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).

A closer examination reveals that they are closer\nto being... engineering mistakes which other crypto currencies have copied\nrather blindly. More precisely we show that the capacity of current crypto\ncurrencies to resist double spending attacks is poor and most current crypto\ncurrencies are highly vulnerable. Satoshi did not implement a timestamp for\nbitcoin transactions and the bitcoin software does not attempt to monitor\ndouble spending events. As a result major attacks involving hundreds of\nmillions of dollars can occur and would not even be recorded. Hundreds of\nmillions have been invested to pay for ASIC hashing infrastructure yet\ninsufficient attention was paid to network neutrality and to insure that the\nprotection layer it promises is effective and cannot be abused.

These affect their hash rate and therefore their protection\nagainst double spending attacks which we do not limit the to the notion of 51%\nattacks which is highly misleading.

Because it is NP-hard, some heuristics\nwere proposed to find sub-optimal solutions. Still, one of the commonly used\nassumption is the one that seeds are chosen on the static network, not the\ndynamic one. This static approach is in fact far from the real-world networks,\nwhere new nodes may appear and old ones dynamically disappear in course of\ntime.\n  The main purpose of this paper is to analyse how the results of one of the\ntypical models for spread of influence - linear threshold - differ depending on\nthe strategy of building the social network used later for choosing seeds. To\nshow the impact of network creation strategy on the final number of influenced\nnodes - outcome of spread of influence, the results for three approaches were\nstudied: one static and two temporal with different granularities, i.e. various\nnumber of time windows. Social networks for each time window encapsulated\ndynamic changes in the network structure. Calculation of various node\nstructural measures like degree or betweenness respected these changes by means\nof forgetting mechanism - more recent data had greater influence on node\nmeasure values. These measures were, in turn, used for node ranking and their\nselection for seeding.\n  All concepts were applied to experimental verification on five real datasets.\nThe results revealed that temporal approach is always better than static and\nthe higher granularity in the temporal social network while seeding, the more\nfinally influenced nodes. Additionally, outdegree measure with exponential\nforgetting typically outperformed other time-dependent structural measures, if\nused for seed candidate ranking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 May 2014 23:32:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 13:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-24"}

The key to the solution is an inversion\nidentity satisfied by the commuting double row transfer matrices. This\ninversion identity is established directly in the Temperley-Lieb algebra. We\nclassify the eigenvalues of the double row transfer matrices using the physical\ncombinatorics of the patterns of zeros in the complex spectral parameter plane\nand obtain finitized characters related to spaces of coinvariants of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_4$ fermions. In the continuum scaling limit, the Robin boundary\nconditions are associated with irreducible Virasoro Verma modules with\nconformal weights $\\Delta_{r,s-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{32}(L^2-4)$ where\n$L=2s-1-4r$, $r\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, $s\\in\\mathbb{N}$. These conformal weights\npopulate a Kac table with half-integer Kac labels. Fusion of the corresponding\nmodules with the generators of the Kac fusion algebra is examined and general\nfusion rules are proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 May 2014 02:38:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 07:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We implement a new,\nphysically motivated supernova feedback model that can approximate the Sedov\nsolutions at all (from the free expansion to snowplow) stages. We find that\nthere is a significant time delay of about ten million years between the peak\nof star formation and that of escape fraction, due to the time required for the\nbuild-up and subsequent destruction of the star-forming cloud by supernova\nfeedback. Consequently, the photon number-weighted mean escape fraction for\ndwarf galaxies in halos of mass 10^8-10^10.5 Msun is found to be <fesc>~11%,\nalthough instantaneous values of f_esc>20% are common when star formation is\nstrongly modulated by the supernova explosions. We find that the inclusion of\nrunaway OB stars increases the mean escape fraction by 22% to <fesc>~14%. As\nsupernovae resulting from runaway OB stars tend to occur in less dense\nenvironments, the feedback effect is enhanced and star formation is further\nsuppressed in halos with Mvir>10^9 Msun in the simulation with runaway OB stars\ncompared with the model without them.

The\n$\\kappa$-distribution has a power-law tail, instead of an exponential cutoff,\nwell above the thermal peak momentum.

As a result, the injection fraction for the $\\kappa$-distribution\ndepends on the shock Mach number much less severely compared to that for the\nMaxwellian distribution. Thus, the existence of $\\kappa$-like suprathermal\ntails at shocks would ease the problem of extremely low injection fractions,\nespecially for electrons and especially at weak shocks such as those found in\nthe intracluster medium.

Gaussian AW pulse with length-scale much shorter\nthan ABC domain length and harmonic AW with wavelength equal to ABC domain\nlength are studied for four different resistivities. While it is found that AWs\ndissipate quickly in the ABC field, surprisingly, AW perturbation energy\nincreases in time. In the case of the harmonic AW perturbation energy growth is\ntransient in time, attaining peaks in both velocity and magnetic perturbation\nenergies within timescales much smaller than resistive time. In the case of the\nGaussian AW pulse velocity perturbation energy growth is still transient in\ntime, attaining a peak within few resistive times, while magnetic perturbation\nenergy continues to grow. It is also shown that the total magnetic energy\ndecreases in time and this is governed by the resistive evolution of the\nbackground ABC magnetic field rather than AW damping. On contrary, when\nbackground magnetic field is uniform, the total magnetic energy decrease is\nprescribed by AW damping, because there is no resistive evolution of the\nbackground. By considering runs with different amplitudes and by analysing\nperturbation spectra, possible dynamo action by AW perturbation-induced\nperistaltic flow and inverse cascade of magnetic energy have been excluded.\nTherefore, the perturbation energy growth is attributed to a new instability.\nThe growth rate appears to be dependent on the value of the resistivity and\nspatial scale of the AW disturbance.

It\nhas already been demonstrated that the vortex core polarity can be reversed\nwith external AC magnetic fields, frequency-tuned to the (sub-GHz) gyrotropic\neigenmode or to (multi-GHz) azimuthal spin wave modes, where reversal times in\nthe sub-ns regime can be realized. This fast vortex core switching may also be\nof technological interest as the vortex core polarity can be regarded as one\ndata bit. Here we experimentally demonstrate that unidirectional vortex core\nreversal by excitation with sub-100 ps long orthogonal monopolar magnetic pulse\nsequences is possible in a wide range of pulse lengths and amplitudes. The\napplication of such short digital pulses is the favourable excitation scheme\nfor technological applications. Measured phase diagrams of this unidirectional,\nspin wave mediated vortex core reversal are in good qualitative agreement with\nphase diagrams obtained from micromagnetic simulations. The time dependence of\nthe reversal process, observed by time-resolved scanning transmission X-ray\nmicroscopy indicates a switching time of 100 ps and fits well with our\nsimulations.

Although the\nprevious studies have proposed optimal algorithms to maximize $QoA$ under an\nimposed deadline and a given aggregation tree, there is no work on constructing\noptimal tree in this context. In this paper, we cast an optimization problem to\naddress optimal tree construction for deadline-constrained data aggregation in\nWSNs. We demonstrate that the ratio between the maximum achievable $QoA$s of\nthe optimal and the worst aggregation trees is as large as $O(2^D)$, where $D$\nis the sink deadline and thus makes devising efficient solution of the problem\nan issue of paramount value.

It is\ngenerally accepted that second order descent methods are the most robust, fast,\nand reliable approaches for nonlinear optimization of a general smooth\nfunction. However, in the context of computer vision, second order descent\nmethods have two main drawbacks: (1) the function might not be analytically\ndifferentiable and numerical approximations are impractical, and (2) the\nHessian may be large and not positive definite. To address these issues, this\npaper proposes generic descent maps, which are average \"descent directions\" and\nrescaling factors learned in a supervised fashion. Using generic descent maps,\nwe derive a practical algorithm - Supervised Descent Method (SDM) - for\nminimizing Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) problems. During training, SDM learns\na sequence of decent maps that minimize the NLS. In testing, SDM minimizes the\nNLS objective using the learned descent maps without computing the Jacobian or\nthe Hessian. We prove the conditions under which the SDM is guaranteed to\nconverge. We illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of SDM in three computer\nvision problems: rigid image alignment, non-rigid image alignment, and 3D pose\nestimation. In particular, we show how SDM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in the problem of facial feature detection.

It is proved that if $G$ admits a soluble group of\nautomorphisms $A$ of coprime order, then $h^*(G)$ is bounded in terms of $h^*\n(C_G(A))$, where $C_G(A)$ is the fixed-point subgroup, and the number of prime\nfactors of $|A|$ counting multiplicities.

In this paper, we propose a distributed interference-aware\nenergy-efficient resource allocation algorithm to maximize each UE's energy\nefficiency (EE) subject to its specific quality of service (QoS) and maximum\ntransmission power constraints. We model the resource allocation problem as a\nnoncooperative game, in which each player is self-interested and wants to\nmaximize its own EE. The formulated EE maximization problem is a non-convex\nproblem and is transformed into a convex optimization problem by exploiting the\nproperties of the nonlinear fractional programming. An iterative optimization\nalgorithm is proposed and verified through computer simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 May 2014 14:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 15:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
