Characterising their atmospheres using transit\nobservations will become a key datum in the quest for detecting an Earth-like\nexoplanet. The atmospheric transmission spectrum of our Earth will be an ideal\ntemplate for comparison with future exo-Earth candidates. By observing a lunar\neclipse, which offers a similar configuration to that of an exoplanet transit,\nwe have obtained a high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio transmission\nspectrum of the Earth's atmosphere. This observation was performed with the\nHigh Resolution Spectrograph at Xinglong Station, China during the total lunar\neclipse in December 2011. We compare the observed transmission spectrum with\nour atmospheric model, and determine the characteristics of the various\natmospheric species in detail. In the transmission spectrum, O2, O3, O2-O2, NO2\nand H2O are detected, and their column densities are measured and compared with\nthe satellites data. The visible Chappuis band of ozone produces the most\nprominent absorption feature, which suggests that ozone is a promising molecule\nfor the future exo-Earth characterization. The individual O2 lines are resolved\nand O2 isotopes are clearly detected. Our new observations do not confirm the\nabsorption features of Ca II or Na I which have been reported in previous lunar\neclipse observations. However, features in these and some other strong\nFraunhofer line positions do occur in the observed spectrum. We propose that\nthese are due to a Raman-scattered component in the forward-scattered sunlight\nappearing in the lunar umbral spectrum. Water vapour absorption is found to be\nrather weak in our spectrum because the atmosphere we probed is relatively dry,\nwhich prompts us to discuss the detectability of water vapour in Earth-like\nexoplanet atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 16:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The dominant effect\nof neutrino mass is to lower the typical amplitude of density perturbations\nthat eventually form halos, but for neutrino masses $> 0.4eV$ the threshold for\nhalo formation can be changed significantly as well. We study the spherical\ncollapse model for halo formation in cosmologies with neutrino masses in the\nrange $m_{\\nu i} =0.05eV$- $1eV$ and find that halo formation is differently\nsensitive to $\\Omega_\\nu$ and $m_\\nu$.

The added\nsensitivity to $m_{\\nu}$ is small but potentially important for scenarios with\nheavier sterile neutrinos. Massive neutrinos cause the evolution of density\nperturbations to be scale-dependent at high redshift which complicates the\nusual mapping between the collapse threshold and halo abundance.

The interesting aspect of such\na construction is that even though the topological building blocks in the low\ndimension may be gapped, the higher dimensional semimetallic phase emerges as a\ngapless critical point of a topological phase transition between two distinct\ninsulating phases. In this work, we extend this idea by constructing\nthree-dimensional topological semimetallic phases akin to Weyl systems by\nstacking one-dimensional Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) lattice tight binding models\nwith non-trivial topology. The generalized AAH model is a family of one\ndimensional tight binding models with cosine modulations in both hopping and\nonsite energy terms. In this paper, we present a two-parameter generalization\nof the AAH model that can access topological phases in three dimensions within\na unified framework.

We fit each SED in\ntwo ways: (1) fit T(cold) and beta simultaneously, (2) hold beta constant and\nfit T(cold). We compare T(cold) and beta with star formation rates (calculated\nfrom L(Halpha) and L(24)), the luminosity of the old stellar population (traced\nthrough L(3.6), and the dust mass surface density (traced by 500 micron\nluminosity, L(500)). We find a significant trend between SFR/L(500) and\nT(cold), implying that the flux of hard UV photons relative to the amount of\ndust is significantly contributing to the heating of the cold, or diffuse, dust\ncomponent. We also see a trend between L(3.6)/L(500) and beta, indicating that\nthe old stellar population contributes to the heating at far-IR/submillimeter\nwavelengths. Finally, we find that when beta is held constant, T(cold) exhibits\na strongly decreasing radial trend, illustrating that the shape of the far-IR\nSED is changing radially through a galaxy, thus confirming on a sample almost\ndouble in size the trends observed in Galametz et al. (2012).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 20:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

RWM constructs a Markov chain by randomly proposing a new\nposition (the \"proposal move\"), which is then accepted or rejected according to\na rule which makes the chain reversible with respect to \\pi. When the dimension\nN is large a key question is to determine the optimal scaling with N of the\nproposal variance: if the proposal variance is too large, the algorithm will\nreject the proposed moves too often; if it is too small, the algorithm will\nexplore the state space too slowly. Determining the optimal scaling of the\nproposal variance gives a measure of the cost of the algorithm as well. One\napproach to tackle this issue, which we adopt here, is to derive diffusion\nlimits for the algorithm. Such an approach has been proposed in the seminal\npapers [RGG97, RR98]; in particular in [RGG97] the authors derive a diffusion\nlimit for the RWM algorithm under the two following assumptions: i) the\nalgorithm is started in stationarity; ii) the target measure $\\pi$ is in\nproduct form. The present paper considers the situation of practical interest\nin which both assumptions i) and ii) are removed. That is a) we study the case\n(which occurs in practice) in which the algorithm is started out of\nstationarity and b) we consider target measures which are in non-product form.\nThe target measures that we consider arise in Bayesian nonparametric statistics\nand in the study of conditioned diffusions. We prove that, out of stationarity,\nthe optimal scaling for the proposal variance is O(N), as it is in\nstationarity. Notice that the optimal scaling in and out of stationatity need\nnot be the same in general, and indeed they differ e.g. in the case of the MALA\nalgorithm [KOS16].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 21:03:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 09:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Among the most prominent and well-tested of these anomalies is the\nCold Spot, which constitutes the only significant deviation from gaussianity in\nthe CMB. Planck's non-detection of primordial non-gaussianity on smaller scales\nthus suggests the existence of a physical mechanism whereby significant\nnon-gaussianity is generated on large angular scales only.

The temperature within the twisted field and sheared\narcades is higher than that of the ambient volume, suggesting that magnetic\nreconnection most likely works there. The driver behind the reconnection is\nattributed to shearing and converging motions at magnetic footpoints with\nvelocities in the range of 0.1--0.6 km s$^{-1}$. The rotation of the preceding\nsunspot also contributes to the MFR buildup. Extrapolated three-dimensional\nnon-linear force-free field structures further reveal the locations of the\nreconnection to be in a bald-patch region and in a hyperbolic flux tube.

However, such\nservices are vulnerable to attacks from socialbots $-$ automated accounts that\nmimic real users $-$ seeking to tamper statistics by posting messages generated\nautomatically and interacting with legitimate users. Potentially, if created in\nlarge scale, socialbots could be used to bias or even invalidate many existing\nservices, by infiltrating the social networks and acquiring trust of other\nusers with time. This study aims at understanding infiltration strategies of\nsocialbots in the Twitter microblogging platform. To this end, we create 120\nsocialbot accounts with different characteristics and strategies (e.g., gender\nspecified in the profile, how active they are, the method used to generate\ntheir tweets, and the group of users they interact with), and investigate the\nextent to which these bots are able to infiltrate the Twitter social network.\nOur results show that even socialbots employing simple automated mechanisms are\nable to successfully infiltrate the network. Additionally, using a $2^k$\nfactorial design, we quantify infiltration effectiveness of different bot\nstrategies.

We show that this variational principle can\narise as a low energy ($L_P = (G\\hbar/c^3)^{1/2} \\to 0$) relic of a plausible\nnonperturbative effect of quantum gravity, viz. the existence of a\nzero-point-length in the spacetime. Our result is nonperturbative in the\nfollowing sense: If we modify the geodesic distance in a spacetime by\nintroducing a zero-point-length, to incorporate some effects of quantum\ngravity, and take the limit $L_P \\to 0$ of the Ricci scalar of the modified\nmetric, we end up getting a nontrivial, leading order ($L_P$ - independent)\nterm. \\textit{This term is identical to the expression for entropy density of\nspacetime used previously in the emergent gravity approach.} This reconfirms\nthe idea that the microscopic degrees of freedom of the spacetime, when\nproperly described in the full theory, could lead to an effective description\nof geometry in terms of a thermodynamic variational principle.

This is demonstrated by processing a sample of\nboosted W boson Monte Carlo events together with their QCD background. The\nmethod is quite general and can be used as a pre-processing step in conjunction\nwith any jet-finder or other event-shape algorithm.

Some well-known tests include the Hotelling\n$T^2$-test and the empirical likelihood ratio test proposed by Owen [Biometrika\n75 (1988) 237-249; Ann. Statist. 18 (1990) 90-120]. Recently, Hotelling\n$T^2$-test has been modified to work for a high-dimensional mean, and the\nempirical likelihood method for a mean has been shown to be valid when the\ndimension of the mean vector goes to infinity. However, the asymptotic\ndistributions of these tests depend on whether the dimension of the mean vector\nis fixed or goes to infinity. In this paper, we propose to split the sample\ninto two parts and then to apply the empirical likelihood method to two\nequations instead of d equations, where d is the dimension of the underlying\nrandom vector. The asymptotic distribution of the new test is independent of\nthe dimension of the mean vector. A simulation study shows that the new test\nhas a very stable size with respect to the dimension of the mean vector, and is\nmuch more powerful than the modified Hotelling $T^2$-test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 10:17:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

Our mathematical analysis also\nsuggested that cyclic dominance between strains is not a prerequisite for\ncoexistence in competitive range expansions.

These\nadditional second laws also hold for quantum systems, and are, in fact, often\nmore relevant in this regime. They place a restriction on how the probabilities\nof energy levels can evolve. Here, we consider additional restrictions on how\nthe coherences between energy levels can evolve.

We\nargue that this is not ideal and somewhat inelegant as it results in large\nprocessing burdens, and instead attempt to incorporate these constraints\nthrough priors obtained directly from training data. A prior distribution\ncovering the probability of a human pose occurring is used to incorporate\nlikely human poses. This distribution is obtained offline, by fitting a\nGaussian mixture model to a large dataset of recorded human body poses, tracked\nusing a Kinect sensor. We combine this prior information with a random walk\ntransition model to obtain an upper body model, suitable for use within a\nrecursive Bayesian filtering framework. Our model can be viewed as a mixture of\ndiscrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, in that states behave as random walks,\nbut drift towards a set of typically observed poses. This model is combined\nwith measurements of the human head and hand positions, using recursive\nBayesian estimation to incorporate temporal information. Measurements are\nobtained using face detection and a simple skin colour hand detector, trained\nusing the detected face. The suggested model is designed with analytical\ntractability in mind and we show that the pose tracking can be\nRao-Blackwellised using the mixture Kalman filter, allowing for computational\nefficiency while still incorporating bio-mechanical properties of the upper\nbody. In addition, the use of the proposed upper body model allows reliable\nthree-dimensional pose estimates to be obtained indirectly for a number of\njoints that are often difficult to detect using traditional object recognition\nstrategies. Comparisons with Kinect sensor results and the state of the art in\n2D pose estimation highlight the efficacy of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 11:54:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 12:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-18"}

More than 60 planets have been discovered so far in systems that\nharbour two stars, some of which have binary semi-major axes as small as 20 au.\nIt is well known that the formation of planets in such systems is strongly\ninfluenced by the stellar components, since the protoplanetary disc and the\nparticles within are exposed to the gravitational influence of the binary.\nHowever, the question on how self-gravitating protoplanetary bodies affect the\nevolution of a radiative, circumprimary disc is still open. Aims. We present\nour 2D hydrodynamical GPU-CPU code and study the interaction of several\nthousands of self-gravitating particles with a viscous and radiative\ncircumprimary disc within a binary star system. To our knowledge this program\nis the only one at the moment that is capable to handle this many particles and\nto calculate their influence on each other and on the disc. Methods. We\nperformed hydrodynamical simulations of a circumstellar disc assuming the\nbinary system to be coplanar. Our gridbased staggered mesh code relies on ideas\nfrom ZEUS-2D, where we implemented the FARGO algorithm and an additional energy\nequation for the radiative cooling according to opacity tables. To treat\nparticle motion we used a parallelised version of the precise Bulirsch - Stoer\nalgorithm. Four models in total where computed taking into account (i) only\nN-body interaction, (ii) N-body and disc interaction, (iii) the influence of\ncomputational parameters (especially smoothing) on N-body interaction, and (iv)\nthe influence of a quiet low-eccentricity disc while running model (ii). The\nimpact velocities where measured at two different time intervals and were\ncompared. Results. We show that the combination of disc- and N-body\nself-gravity can have a significant influence on the orbit evolution of roughly\nMoon sized protoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 12:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-25"}

In this work we quantify\nthese two notions in terms of musical instrumentation and production\ntechnologies that are typically involved in crafting popular music. We assign a\n\"complexity value\" to each music style. A style is complex if it shows the\nproperty of having both high variety and low uniformity in instrumentation. We\nfind a strong inverse relation between variety and uniformity of music styles\nthat is remarkably stable over the last half century. Individual styles,\nhowever, show dramatic changes in their \"complexity\" during that period. Styles\nlike \"new wave\" or \"disco\" quickly climbed towards higher complexity in the 70s\nand fell back to low complexity levels shortly afterwards, whereas styles like\n\"folk rock\" remained at constant high complexity levels. We show that changes\nin the complexity of a style are related to its number of sales and to the\nnumber of artists contributing to that style. As a style attracts a growing\nnumber of artists, its instrumentational variety usually increases. At the same\ntime the instrumentational uniformity of a style decreases, i.e. a unique\nstylistic and increasingly complex expression pattern emerges. In contrast,\nalbum sales of a given style typically increase with decreasing complexity.\nThis can be interpreted as music becoming increasingly formulaic once\ncommercial or mainstream success sets in.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 12:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-03"}

Inspired by natural\nphenomena, researchers have developed many successful evolutionary algorithms\nwhich, at original versions, define operators that mimic the way nature solves\ncomplex problems, with no actual consideration of the exploration/exploitation\nbalance. In this paper, a novel nature-inspired algorithm called the States of\nMatter Search (SMS) is introduced. The SMS algorithm is based on the simulation\nof the states of matter phenomenon. In SMS, individuals emulate molecules which\ninteract to each other by using evolutionary operations which are based on the\nphysical principles of the thermal-energy motion mechanism. The algorithm is\ndevised by considering each state of matter at one different\nexploration/exploitation ratio. The evolutionary process is divided into three\nphases which emulate the three states of matter: gas, liquid and solid. In each\nstate, molecules (individuals) exhibit different movement capacities. Beginning\nfrom the gas state (pure exploration), the algorithm modifies the intensities\nof exploration and exploitation until the solid state (pure exploitation) is\nreached. As a result, the approach can substantially improve the balance\nbetween exploration/exploitation, yet preserving the good search capabilities\nof an evolutionary approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 13:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

A bird's eye view of the graded module theory over a graded ring\ngives an impression of the module theory with the added adjective \"graded\" to\nall its statements. Once the grading is considered to be trivial, the graded\ntheory reduces to the usual module theory. So from this perspective, the graded\nmodule theory can be considered as an extension of the module theory. However,\none aspect that could be easily missed from such a panoramic view is that, the\ngraded module theory comes equipped with a shifting, thanks to being able to\npartition the structures and rearranging these partitions. This adds an extra\nlayer of structure (and complexity) to the theory. An sparkling example of this\nis the theory of graded Grothendieck groups, K^{gr}_0, which is the main focus\nof this monograph. Whereas the usual K_0 is an abelian group, thanks to the\nshiftings, K^{gr}_0 has a natural Z[\\Gamma]-module structure, where \\Gamma is\nthe graded group.

It is shown in\nthis manuscript how to effectively calculate all basis set integrals, which\nincludes the mixed Gaussian-Sinc integrals, with a fast and accurate method.\nThe Sinc basis is invariant to the choice of the position of the Coulomb\npotential, as opposed to traditional grid based methods. This invariance\nguarantees that the choice of the grids origin has no effect on the electronic\nstructure calculation. This is because the Coulomb potential is treated\nproperly in this methodology, as opposed to DVR methodologies. The off-diagonal\nterms are sparse but very important around the Coulomb singularity. In general,\nfive to six significant digits of accuracy on all converged results without the\nlinear dependency problems of the Gaussian methodologies are achievable.

The primary focus is on self-interaction: How does an\nobject's own field affect its motion? General laws governing the self-force and\nself-torque are derived using simple, non-perturbative arguments. The relevant\nconcepts are developed gradually by considering motion in a series of\nincreasingly complicated theories. Newtonian gravity is discussed first, then\nKlein-Gordon theory, electromagnetism, and finally general relativity. Linear\nand angular momenta as well as centers of mass are defined in each of these\ncases. Multipole expansions for the force and torque are then derived to all\norders for arbitrarily self-interacting extended objects. These expansions are\nfound to be structurally identical to the laws of motion satisfied by extended\ntest bodies, except that all relevant fields are replaced by effective versions\nwhich exclude the self-fields in a particular sense.

First, we study a setting in which one decoder can use a finite\ncapacity link to send the other decoder information regarding the messages or\nthe channel states. In this scenario we analyze two cases: one where noncausal\nstate information is available to the encoder and the strong decoder and the\nother where state information is available only to the encoder in a causal\nmanner. Second, we examine a setting in which the cooperation between the\ndecoders is limited to taking place before the outputs of the channel are\ngiven. In this case, one decoder, which is informed of the state sequence\nnoncausally, can cooperate only to send the other decoder rate-limited\ninformation about the state sequence. The proofs of the capacity regions\nintroduce a new method of coding for channels with cooperation between\ndifferent users, where we exploit the link between the decoders for\nmultiple-binning. Finally, we discuss the optimality of using rate splitting\ntechniques when coding for cooperative BCs. In particular, we show that rate\nsplitting is not necessarily optimal when coding for cooperative BCs by solving\nan example in which our method of coding outperforms rate splitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 13:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

The main result is the large deviation\nprinciple (LDP), in the limit where $K \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $N \\rightarrow\n\\infty$ with $K/N = c$, for a sequence of random, number-density measures,\nwhich are the empirical measures of dependent random variables that count the\ndroplet sizes. The rate function in the LDP is the relative entropy $R(\\theta |\n\\rho^*)$, where $\\theta$ is a possible asymptotic configuration of the\nnumber-density measures and $\\rho^*$ is a Poisson distribution restricted to\nthe set of positive integers. This LDP reveals that $\\rho^*$ is the equilibrium\ndistribution of the number-density measures, which in turn implies that\n$\\rho^*$ is the equilibrium distribution of the random variables that count the\ndroplet sizes. We derive the LDP via a local large deviation estimate of the\nprobability that the number-density measures equal $\\theta$ for any probability\nmeasure $\\theta$ in the range of these random measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 14:08:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Aug 2014 22:29:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 12:26:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 15:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-11"}

A famous trend to overcome this issue is to focus\non subclasses of alternant/Goppa codes with a non trivial automorphism group.\nSuch codes display then symmetries allowing compact parity-check or generator\nmatrices. For instance, a key-reduction is obtained by taking quasi-cyclic (QC)\nor quasi-dyadic (QD) alternant/Goppa codes. We show that the use of such\nsymmetric alternant/Goppa codes in cryptography introduces a fundamental\nweakness. It is indeed possible to reduce the key-recovery on the original\nsymmetric public-code to the key-recovery on a (much) smaller code that has not\nanymore symmetries. This result is obtained thanks to a new operation on codes\ncalled folding that exploits the knowledge of the automorphism group. This\noperation consists in adding the coordinates of codewords which belong to the\nsame orbit under the action of the automorphism group. The advantage is\ntwofold: the reduction factor can be as large as the size of the orbits, and it\npreserves a fundamental property: folding the dual of an alternant (resp.\nGoppa) code provides the dual of an alternant (resp. Goppa) code. A key point\nis to show that all the existing constructions of alternant/Goppa codes with\nsymmetries follow a common principal of taking codes whose support is globally\ninvariant under the action of affine transformations (by building upon prior\nworks of T. Berger and A. D{\\\"{u}}r). This enables not only to present a\nunified view but also to generalize the construction of QC, QD and even\nquasi-monoidic (QM) Goppa codes.

A simple prescription for the evolution of the stars is used,\nwith the first supernova explosion at t=4.4 Myrs. We find that the presence of\nthe GMC clump causes short-lived attenuation effects on the X-ray emission of\nthe cluster. However, once most of the material has been ablated away by the\nwinds the remaining dense clumps do not have a noticable effect on the\nattenuation compared with the assumed interstellar medium column. We determine\nthe evolution of the cluster X-ray luminosity, L$_X$, and spectra, and generate\nsynthetic images. The intrinsic X-ray luminosity drops from nearly 10$^{34}$\nergs s$^{-1}$ while the winds are `bottled up', to a near constant value of\n1.7$\\times 10^{32}\\rm ergs s^{-1}$ between t=1-4 Myrs. L$_X$ reduces slightly\nduring each star's red supergiant stage due to the depressurization of the hot\ngas. However, L$_X$ increases to $\\approx 10^{34}\\rm\\,ergs s^{-1}$ during each\nstar's Wolf-Rayet stage. The X-ray luminosity is enhanced by 2-3 orders of\nmagnitude to $\\sim 10^{37}\\rm ergs s^{-1}$ for at least 4600 yrs after each\nsupernova, at which time the blast wave leaves the grid and the X-ray\nluminosity drops. The X-ray luminosity of our simulation is generally\nconsiderably fainter than predicted from spherically-symmetric bubble models,\ndue to the leakage of hot gas material through gaps in the outer shell. This\nprocess reduces the pressure within our simulation and thus the X-ray emission.\nHowever, the X-ray luminosities and temperatures which we obtain are comparable\nto similarly powerful massive young clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 15:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In order to improve the quality of translations, it is important to\nexploit available resources efficiently. Employing different translation\nresources with different characteristics has many challenges. In this paper, we\npropose a method for exploiting available translation resources simultaneously.\nThis method employs Learning to Rank(LTR) for exploiting different translation\nresources. To apply LTR methods for query translation, we define different\ntranslation relation based features in addition to context based features. We\nuse the contextual information contained in translation resources for\nextracting context based features.The proposed method uses LTR to construct a\ntranslation ranking model based on defined features. The constructed model is\nused for ranking translation candidates of query words. To evaluate the\nproposed method we do English-Persian CLIR, in which we employ the translation\nranking model to find translations of English queries and employ the\ntranslations to retrieve Persian documents. Experimental results show that our\napproach significantly outperforms single resource based CLIR methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 11:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-22"}
