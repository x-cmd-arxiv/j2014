Our\nmethod is based on the covariogram functional for random mesurable sets (RAMS)\nand on a result about the representation of positive operators in a locally\ncompact space. RAMS are an alternative to the classical random closed sets in\nstochastic geometry and geostatistics, they provide a weaker framework allowing\nto manipulate more irregular functionals, such as the perimeter. We therefore\nuse the illustration provided by the $S\\_{2}$ problem to advocate the use of\nRAMS for solving theoretical problems of geometric nature. Along the way, we\nextend the theory of random measurable sets, and in particular the local\napproximation of the perimeter by local covariograms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 May 2014 18:56:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 19:37:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 Feb 2015 10:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-03"}

Continued legacy of bad estimates has compelled researchers,\npractitioners and business organizations to draw their attention towards\nanother dimension of the problem and seriously validate an additional\ncomponent, viz. size estimation. Recent studies have shown that size is the\nprincipal determinant of cost, and therefore an accurate size estimate is\ncrucial to good cost estimation. Improving the accuracy of size estimates is,\ntherefore, instrumental in improving the accuracy of cost and schedule\nestimates. Moreover, software size and cost estimates have the highest utility\nat the time of project inception, when most important decisions (e.g. budget\nallocation, personnel allocation, etc). are taken. The dilemma, however, is\nthat only high-level requirements for a project are available at this stage.\nLeveraging this high-level information to produce an accurate estimate of\nsoftware size is an extremely challenging and high risk task. This study\nacknowledges the presence and effect of risk in any software estimate and\noffers pragmatic strategies for risk mitigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 May 2014 19:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}

Terrestrial N and H isotopic\ncompositions are in the range of values characterizing primitive meteorites,\nwhich suggests that water, nitrogen, and other volatile elements on Earth\noriginated from a cosmochemical reservoir that also sourced the parent bodies\nof primitive meteorites. Remnants of the proto-solar nebula (PSN) are still\npresent in the mantle, presumably signing the sequestration of PSN gas at an\nearly stage of planetary growth. The contribution of cometary volatiles appears\nlimited to a few percents at most of the total volatile inventory of the Earth.\nThe isotope signatures of H, N, Ne and Ar can be explained by mixing between\ntwo end-members of solar and chondritic compositions, respectively, and do not\nrequire isotopic fractionation during hydrodynamic escape of an early\natmosphere. The terrestrial inventory of 40Ar (produced by the decay of 40K\nthroughout the Earth's history) suggests that a significant fraction of\nradiogenic argon may be still trapped in the silicate Earth. By normalizing\nother volatile element abundances to this isotope, it is proposed that the\nEarth is not as volatile-poor as previously thought. Our planet may indeed\ncontain up to ~3000 ppm water (preferred range : 1000-3000 ppm), and up to ~500\nppm C, both largely sequestrated in the solid Earth.

However,\nthe odd-even effect in our models is significantly weaker than that found in\nPopulation III models. The comparison with the nucleosynthetic yields from\ncore-collapse supernovae at a similar metallicity (Z=0.002) indicates that\nPISNe could have strongly influenced the chemical evolution below Z=0.002,\nassuming a standard initial mass function.

The\nsum-product algorithm is fully parallelizable, owing to the fact that all\nmessages can be update concurrently. However, since it requires extensive\nnumber of highly interconnected wires, the fully-parallel implementation of the\nsum-product on chips is exceedingly challenging. Stochastic decoding\nalgorithms, which exchange binary messages, are of great interest for\nmitigating this challenge and have been the focus of extensive research over\nthe past decade.

Owing to its specific linear dispersion and\nhigh electron mobility at room temperature, graphene is particularly attractive\nfor realizing strong nonlinear effects. However, since graphene is a\ncentrosymmetric material, second-order nonlinearities a priori cancel, which\nimposes to rely on less attractive third-order nonlinearities.

Generally, the proton spin kinetics is\ndetermined by intramolecular and intermolecular magnetic dipole-dipole\ncontributions of proton spins. During many decades it was postulated that the\nmain contribution is a result of intramolecular magnetic dipole-dipole\ninteractions of protons belonging to the same polymer segment. It appears that\nthis postulate is far from reality. The relative weights of intra- and\nintermolecular contributions are time dependent and sensitive to details of\npolymer chain dynamics. It is shown that for isotropic models of polymer\ndynamics the influence of the intermolecular magnetic dipole-dipole\ninteractions increases faster with increasing evolution time (i.e. decreasing\nfrequency) than the corresponding influence of the intramolecular counterpart.\nOn the other hand, an inverted situation is predicted by the tube-reptation\nmodel: here the influence of the intramolecular magnetic dipole-dipole\ninteractions increases faster with time than the contribution from\nintermolecular interactions. The intermolecular contribution in the proton\nrelaxation of polymer melts can experimentally be isolated using the isotope\ndilution technique and this opens a new perspective for experimental\ninvestigations of polymer dynamics by proton NMR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 May 2014 08:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Project HEPGAME was composed to address this challenge.\nOne of the issues is that numerical integration of expressions of current\ninterest have millions of terms and takes weeks to compute. We have\ninvestigated ways to simplify these expressions, using Horner schemes and\ncommon subexpression elimination. Our approach applies MCTS, a search procedure\nthat has been successful in AI. We use it to find near-optimal Horner schemes.\nAlthough MCTS finds better solutions, this approach gives rise to two further\nchallenges. (1) MCTS (with UCT) introduces a constant, $C_p$ that governs the\nbalance between exploration and exploitation. This constant has to be tuned\nmanually. (2) There should be more guided exploration at the bottom of the\ntree, since the current approach reduces the quality of the solution towards\nthe end of the expression. We investigate NMCS (Nested Monte Carlo Search) to\naddress both issues, but find that NMCS is computationally unfeasible for our\nproblem. Then, we modify the MCTS formula by introducing a dynamic\nexploration-exploitation parameter $T$ that decreases linearly with the\niteration number. Consequently, we provide a performance analysis. We observe\nthat a variable $C_p$ solves our domain: it yields more exploration at the\nbottom and as a result the tuning problem has been simplified. The region in\n$C_p$ for which good values are found is increased by more than a tenfold.

We find that the broad-band (3 - 250 keV) energy spectra during all\nspectral states can be adequately reproduced by a model, consisting of two\nComptonized components and an iron-line. We suggest that the seed photons of\nkT_s1~0.7 keV coming from the disk and of temperature kT_s2~1.8 keV coming from\nthe neutron star (NS) are each upscattered by hot electrons of a \"Compton\ncloud\" (herein Comptb1 and Comptb2 components respectively with which are\nassociated similarly subscripted parameters). The photon power-law index\nGamma_{2} is almost constant (Gamma_{2}~2) for all spectral states. In turn,\nGamma_{1} demonstrates a two-phase behavior with the spectral state: Gamma_{1}\nis quasi-constant at the level Gamma_{1}~2 for the HB-NB and Gamma_{1} is less\nthan 2, namely in the range of 1.3<Gamma_1<2, when source traces the FB. We\nalso detect a decrease kT_{s2} from 1.8 keV to 0.7 keV during the FB.
