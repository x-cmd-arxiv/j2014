The acoustic streaming\neffect has been identified as the link between high frequency resonances and\nlow frequency flicker. A highly coupled 3D multiphysics model has been set up\nto calculate the acoustic streaming velocity field inside the arc tube of\nhigh-intensity discharge lamps. It has been found that the velocity field\nsuffers a phase transition to an asymmetrical state at a critical acoustic\nstreaming force. The system behaves similar to a ferromagnet near the Curie\npoint. Furthermore, it is discussed how the model allows to investigate the\nlight flicker phenomenon.

It is found that the irradiation results in\ndecreasing intensity and broadening of the excitonic resonances in the\nreflectivity spectra for all the doses. It is shown that these changes are not\nrelated to a decrease of the exciton transition oscillator strength and,\ntherefore, to the irradiation-induced destruction of the excitonic states, but\ncan be rather ascribed to a common cause, namely, to inhomogeneous broadening\nof the excitonic resonances proportional to the exposure dose.A tentative model\nof the irradiation-induced broadening is considered, with the mechanism of the\nprocess being a consequence of scat-tering of the 2D excitons by structural\ndefects associated with Ga(In) and As vacancies arising upon collisions of the\nhigh-energy ions with regular atoms of the crystal structure. The model is used\nto compare experimental dependence of efficiency of the Ga+-ion-induced\nbroad-ening on distance of the quantum well from the irradiated surface with a\nsimilar dependence calculated using the Monte-Carlo technique.

Hence, casualties caused by the poor decisions\nand guidance are only apparent at the end of the evacuation process and cannot\nthen be remedied. Previous research shows that the performance of routing\nalgorithms for evacuation purposes are sensitive to the initial distribution of\nevacuees, the occupancy levels, the type of disaster and its as well its\nlocations. Thus an algorithm that performs well in one scenario may achieve bad\nresults in another scenario. This problem is especially serious in\nheuristic-based routing algorithms for evacuees where results are affected by\nthe choice of certain parameters. Therefore, this paper proposes a\nsimulation-based evacuee routing algorithm that optimises evacuation by making\nuse of the high computational power of cloud servers. Rather than guiding\nevacuees with a predetermined routing algorithm, a robust Cognitive Packet\nNetwork based algorithm is first evaluated via a cloud-based simulator in a\nfaster-than-real-time manner, and any \"simulated casualties\" are then re-routed\nusing a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to obtain new safe paths for them to\nexits.

Accordingly, in a comparative study the\nwavefunctions of both sets of hydrides and their muonic congeners are first\nderived beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) paradigm, assuming protons and muons\nas quantum waves instead of clamped particles. Then, the non-BO wavefunctions\nare used to derive the AIM structures of both hydrides and muonic congeners\nwithin context of the multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The\nresults of the analysis demonstrate that muons are generally capable of forming\ntheir own atomic basins and the properties of these basins are not\nfundamentally different from those AIM containing protons. Particularly, the\nbonding modes in the muonic species seem to be qualitatively similar to their\ncongener hydrides and no new bonding models is required to describe the bonding\nof muons to a diverse set of neighboring atoms.

Recent methods for explicitly modeling the\nrelationships among character states, speciation rates, and extinction rates on\nphylogenetic trees- BiSSE, QuaSSE, GeoSSE, and related models - have been\nwidely used to test hypotheses about character state-dependent diversification\nrates. Here, we document the disconcerting ease with which neutral traits are\ninferred to have statistically significant associations with speciation rate.\nWe first demonstrate this unfortunate effect for a known model assumption\nviolation: shifts in speciation rate associated with a character not included\nin the model. We further show that for many empirical phylogenies, characters\nsimulated in the absence of state-dependent diversification exhibit an even\nhigher Type I error rate, indicating that the method is susceptible to\nadditional, unknown model inadequacies. For traits that evolve slowly, the root\ncause appears to be a statistical framework that does not require replicated\nshifts in character state and diversification. However, spurious associations\nbetween character state and speciation rate arise even for traits that lack\nphylogenetic signal, suggesting that phylogenetic pseudoreplication alone\ncannot fully explain the problem. The surprising severity of this phenomenon\nsuggests that many trait-diversification relationships reported in the\nliterature may not be real.

A physically motivated family of theories are\nthose where the state space of a two-level system is given by a sphere of\narbitrary dimension. This includes classical bits, and real, complex and\nquaternionic quantum theory. In this paper, we consider relativity of\nsimultaneity (that observers may disagree about the order of events at\ndifferent locations) as applied to a two-armed interferometer, and show that\nthis forbids most interference phenomena more complicated than those of complex\nquantum theory. If interference must depend on some relational property of the\nsetting (such as path difference), then relativity of simultaneity will limit\nstate spaces to standard complex quantum theory, or a subspace thereof. If this\nrelational assumption is relaxed, we find one additional theory compatible with\nrelativity of simultaneity: quaternionic quantum theory.

In this paper we\ndevelop a comprehensive and unified approach that allows to establish\ncharacterizations of the wavefront set in terms of rapid coefficient decay, for\na large variety of dilation groups.\n  For this purpose, we introduce two technical conditions on the dual action of\nthe group $H$, called microlocal admissibilty and (weak) cone approximation\nproperty. Essentially, microlocal admissibilty sets up a systematical\nrelationship between the scales in a wavelet dilated by $h\\in H$ on one side,\nand the matrix norm of $h$ on the other side. The (weak) cone approximation\nproperty describes the ability of the wavelet system to adapt its\nfrequency-side localization to arbitrary frequency cones. Together, microlocal\nadmissibility and the weak cone approximation property allow the\ncharacterization of points in the wavefront set using multiple wavelets.\nReplacing the weak cone approximation by its stronger counterpart gives access\nto single wavelet characterizations.\n  We illustrate the scope of our results by discussing -- in any dimension\n$d\\ge2$ -- the similitude, diagonal and shearlet dilation groups, for which we\nverify the pertinent conditions. As a result, similitude and diagonal groups\ncan be employed for multiple wavelet characterizations, whereas for the\nshearlet groups a single wavelet suffices.

In phase I the amplitude of the order parameter\nvanishes as a power law, in phase II it goes to a nonzero constant, and in\nphase III it oscillates persistently. We construct exact quench phase diagrams\nthat predict the asymptotic state (including the many-body wavefunction)\ndepending on the initial and final detunings and on the Feshbach resonance\nwidth. Outside of the weak coupling regime, both the mechanism and the time\ndependence of the relaxation of the amplitude of the order parameter in phases\nI and II are modified. Also, quenches from arbitrarily weak initial to\nsufficiently strong final coupling do not produce persistent oscillations in\ncontrast to the behavior in the BCS regime.

For relatively low Rayleigh numbers Ra the heat\ntransport is higher when the sidewall is isothermal, kept at a temperature\n$T_c+\\Delta/2$ (where $\\Delta$ is the temperature difference between the\nhorizontal plates and $T_c$ the temperature of the cold plate), than when the\nsidewall is adiabatic. The reason is that in the former case part of the heat\ncurrent avoids the thermal resistance of the fluid layer by escaping through\nthe sidewall that acts as a short-circuit. For higher Ra the bulk becomes more\nisothermal and this reduces the heat current through the sidewall. Therefore\nthe heat flux in a cell with an isothermal sidewall converges to the value\nobtained with an adiabatic sidewall for high enough Ra ($\\simeq 10^{10}$).\nHowever, when the sidewall temperature deviates from $T_c+\\Delta/2$ the heat\ntransport at the bottom and top plates is different from the value obtained\nusing an adiabatic sidewall. In this case the difference does not decrease with\nincreasing Ra thus indicating that the ambient temperature of the experimental\napparatus can influence the heat transfer. A similar behavior is observed when\nonly a very small sidewall region close to the horizontal plates is kept\nisothermal, while the rest of the sidewall is adiabatic. The reason is that in\nthe region closest to the horizontal plates the temperature difference between\nthe fluid and the sidewall is highest. This suggests that one should be careful\nwith the placement of thermal shields outside the fluid sample to minimize\nspurious heat currents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 21:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

Wind farm power output fluctuates\nstrongly in time, over various time scales. Understanding these fluctuations,\nespecially their spatio-temporal characteristics, is particularly important for\nthe design of backup power systems that must be readily available in\nconjunction with wind-farms. In this work we analyze the power fluctuations\nassociated with the wind-input variability at scales between minutes to several\nhours, using large eddy simulations (LES) of extended wind-parks, interacting\nwith the atmospheric boundary layer. LES studies enable careful control of\nparameters and availability of wind-velocities simultaneously across the entire\nwind-farm. The present study focuses on neutral atmospheric conditions and flat\nterrain, using actuator-disk representations of the individual wind-turbines.\nWe consider power from various aggregates of wind-turbines such as the total\naverage power signal, or signals from sub-averages within the wind-farm.\nNon-trivial correlations are observed due to the complex interactions between\nturbines placed downstream of each other, and they lead to noticeable spectral\npeaks at frequencies associated with the inter-turbine spacings when the\nwind-direction is completely fixed. In that case we observe that the frequency\nspectra of the total wind-farm output show a decay that follows approximately a\n$-5/3$ power-law scaling regime, qualitatively consistent with some\nobservations made in field-scale operational wind-parks (Apt, 2007). We find\nthat these features are still observed when the wind-speed varies in magnitude.\nHowever, significant changes in the wind-direction over time tend to smooth out\nthe observed spectral peak and reduce the extent of the observed $-5/3$\npower-law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2014 02:39:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

In recent years, with the\ndevelopment of simulations about supernova explosion, we have a better\nunderstanding about the density profiles and the shock waves in supernovae than\nbefore. It has been shown that the appearance of shock waves not only varies\nwith time, but is also affected by the mass of the supernova. When the mass of\nthe supernova happens to be in a certain range (e.g. it equals 10.8 times the\nmass of the sun), there might be a reverse shock wave, another sudden change of\ndensity except the forward shock wave, emerging in the supernova. In addition,\nthere are some other time-dependent changes of density profiles in different\nsupernova models. Because of these complex density profiles, the expression of\nthe crossing probability at the high resonance, $P_H$, which we used previously\nwould be no longer applicable. In order to get more accurate and reasonable\nresults, we use the data of density profiles in three different supernova\nmodels obtained from simulations to study the variations of $P_s$ (the survival\nprobability of $\\nu_e\\rightarrow\\nu_e$), as well as $P_c$ (the conversion\nprobability of $\\nu_x\\rightarrow\\nu_e$).

Here we calculate the evolution of WD binaries taking into\naccount the excited wind from the companion star induced by X-ray irradiation\nof the accreting WD, which may drive rapid mass transfer even when the\ncompanion star is less massive than the WD. This scenario can naturally explain\nthe formation of the strong-field neutron star in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U\n1822$-$37.

Moreover, we can not only\nreproduce the observed data with a lower dimensional representative but also\nsimultaneously project both the spatial and temporal activity patterns in the\nsame coordinate system. By utilizing the K-means clustering algorithm, five\nsignificant types of clusters which are directly annotated with a corresponding\ncombination of temporal activities can be obtained. This provides a clear\npicture of how the groups of regions are associated with different activities\nat different time of day. Besides the commercial and transportation dominant\narea, we also detect two kinds of residential areas, the developed residential\nareas and the developing residential areas. We further verify the spatial\ndistribution of these clusters in the view of urban form analysis. The results\nshows a high consistency with the government planning from the same periods,\nindicating our model is applicable for inferring the functional regions via\nsocial media check-in data, and can benefit a wide range of fields, such as\nurban planning, public services and location-based recommender systems and\nother purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2014 05:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 03:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-22"}

A K-means network\nmaps the input data into a feature representation by finding the nearest\ncentroid for each input point, which has attracted researchers' great attention\nrecently due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and scalability. However, one\ndrawback of this feature mapping is that it tends to be unreliable when the\ntraining data contains noise. To address this issue, we propose a SVDD based\nfeature learning algorithm that describes the density and distribution of each\ncluster from K-means with an SVDD ball for more robust feature representation.\nFor this purpose, we present a new SVDD algorithm called C-SVDD that centers\nthe SVDD ball towards the mode of local density of each cluster, and we show\nthat the objective of C-SVDD can be solved very efficiently as a linear\nprogramming problem. Additionally, traditional unsupervised feature learning\nmethods usually take an average or sum of local representations to obtain\nglobal representation which ignore spatial relationship among them. To use\nspatial information we propose a global representation with a variant of SIFT\ndescriptor. The architecture is also extended with multiple receptive field\nscales and multiple pooling sizes.

In this paper, we address the\nproblem of recovering sparse representations for noisy data points in a\ndictionary whose columns correspond to corrupted data lying close to a union of\nsubspaces. We consider a constrained $\\ell_1$-minimization and study conditions\nunder which the solution of the proposed optimization satisfies the approximate\nsubspace-sparse recovery condition.

In the $L_d$\nmodel, it is assumed that the initial square lattice is non-ideal and some\nfraction of sites, $d$, is occupied by non-conducting point defects\n(impurities). In the $K_d$ model, the initial square lattice is perfect.\nHowever, it is assumed that some fraction of the sites in the $k$-mers, $d$,\nconsists of defects, i.e., are non-conducting.

The dependencies of the percolation threshold concentration of the\nconducting sites, $p_c$, vs the concentration of defects, $d$, were analyzed\nfor different values of $k$. Above some critical concentration of defects,\n$d_m$, percolation is blocked in both models, even at the jamming concentration\nof $k$-mers.

It ex- hibits a lot of shoulder structures and\nabsorption peaks, which arise from the extreme points and the saddle points of\nthe parabolic bands, respectively. The threshold op- tical excitations, only\nassociated with the 2px and 2py orbitals of the carbon atoms, are revealed in a\nshoulder structure at ?3.5 eV. The first symmetric absorption peak, appearing\nat ~11 eV, corresponds to energy bands due to the considerable hybridiza- tion\nof carbon 2pz orbitals and H 1s orbitals. Also, some absorption peaks at higher\nfrequencies indicate the bonding of 2s and 1s orbitals. These results are in\nsharp contrast to those of the sp2 graphene systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2014 07:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 01:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-31"}

It is expected to permit higher end\nuser Quality of Service (QoS) along with less operational and maintenance cost\nfor telecom service providers. Self organized cellular networks incorporate a\ncollection of functions for automatic configuration, optimization and\nmaintenance of cellular networks. As mobile end users continue to use network\nresources while moving from a cell boundary to other, traffic load within a\ncell does not remain constant. Thus Load balancing as a part of self organized\nnetwork solution, has become one of the most active and emerging fields of\nresearch in Cellular Network. It involves transfer of load from overloaded\ncells to the neighbouring cells with free resources for more balanced load\ndistribution in order to maintain appropriate end-user experience and network\nperformance.

In particular, we\nshow that every stable equivalence of Morita type between Frobenius-finite\nalgebras over an algebraically closed field can be lifted to a derived\nequivalence. %Thus Frobenius-finite algebras share many common %invariants of\nboth derived equivalences and stable equivalences.

It thus\nshows phase coexistence, usually by proceeding though nucleation at random\ndefect sites followed by propagation of phase boundary domain walls. The\ntransition occurs at a temperature that can be varied by doping other metals\nonto the Rh site. We have taken advantage of this to yield control over the\ntransition process by preparing an epilayer with oppositely directed doping\ngradients of Pd and Ir throughout its height, yielding a gradual transition\nthat occurs between 350~K and 500~K. As the sample is heated, a horizontal\nantiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic phase boundary domain wall moves gradually up\nthrough the layer, its position controlled by the temperature. This mobile\nmagnetic domain wall affects the magnetisation and resistivity of the layer in\na way that can be controlled, and hence exploited, for novel device\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2014 12:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

The extended model can be viewed as a layered\nqueueing network, where the first layer consists of the queues of products and\nthe second layer is the ordinary machine-repair model. Since the repair time of\none machine may affect the time the other machine is not able to process\nproducts, the downtimes of the machines are correlated. This correlation leads\nto dependence between the queues of products in the first layer. Analysis of\nthese queue length distributions is hard, since the exact dependence structure\nfor the downtimes, or the queue lengths, is not known. Therefore, we obtain an\napproximation for the complete marginal queue length distribution of any queue\nin the first layer, by viewing such a queue as a single server queue with\ncorrelated server downtimes. Under an explicit assumption on the form of the\ndowntime dependence, we obtain exact results for the queue length distribution\nfor that single server queue.

In this photo-induced radical pair (RP) model\nthe signal transduction mechanism was physical rather than chemical in nature,\nas otherwise generally assumed in the literature.

The\nintervals of time between events, $\\tau_{1},\\tau_{2},...$, are independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with a common density\n$\\rho(\\tau)$. Fixing the total observation time to $t$ induces a global\nconstraint on the sum of these random intervals, which accordingly become\ninterdependent. Here we focus on the largest interval among such a sequence on\nthe fixed time interval $(0,t)$. Depending on how the last interval is treated,\nwe consider three different situations, indexed by $\\alpha=$ I, II and III. We\ninvestigate the distribution of the longest interval $\\ell^\\alpha_{\\max}(t)$\nand the probability $Q^\\alpha(t)$ that the last interval is the longest one.

In many situations, the\nexact sampling from a given distribution is impossible or computationally\nexpensive and, therefore, one needs to resort to approximate sampling\nstrategies. However, there is no well-developed theory providing meaningful\nnonasymptotic guarantees for the approximate sampling procedures, especially in\nthe high-dimensional problems. This paper makes some progress in this direction\nby considering the problem of sampling from a distribution having a smooth and\nlog-concave density defined on \\(\\RR^p\\), for some integer \\(p>0\\). We\nestablish nonasymptotic bounds for the error of approximating the target\ndistribution by the one obtained by the Langevin Monte Carlo method and its\nvariants. We illustrate the effectiveness of the established guarantees with\nvarious experiments. Underlying our analysis are insights from the theory of\ncontinuous-time diffusion processes, which may be of interest beyond the\nframework of log-concave densities considered in the present work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2014 15:00:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 03:15:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 03:29:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 16:02:53 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 23:19:39 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2016 08:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

For comparison of\nsimulations of influx and cumulative uptake versus observed results six set of\ndata extracted from literature are used. For ions without limitations of\navailability fixed and moving boundary models produces similar results with\nsmall errors. Instead, to low concentrations, the fixed boundary model over\npredicts while the moving boundary model always produces better results mainly\nfor K. For the P uptake the moving boundary model produces better results only\nwhen the concentrations are very low and their predictions are comparable to\nthe obtained by a 3D-architectural model. The obtained improvements would\nexplain any failures of previous models for ions of low availability.\nTherefore, our model could be a simpler alternative due to its low\ncomputational burden.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 18:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-12"}

Constant curvature solutions corresponding\nto the flat and de Sitter spacetime are obtained. The Jordan and Einstein\nframes are considered; the potential and the mass of the scalar degree of\nfreedom are found. We show that the flat spacetime is stable and the de Sitter\nspacetime is unstable. The slow-roll parameters $\\epsilon$, $\\eta$, and the\n$e$-fold number of the model are evaluated in the Einstein frame. The index of\nthe scalar spectrum power-law $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are\ncalculated. Critical points of autonomous equations for the de Sitter phase and\nthe matter dominated epoch are found and studied. We obtain the approximate\nsolution of equations of motion which is the deviation from the de Sitter phase\nin the Jordan frame. It is demonstrated that the model passes the matter\nstability test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 23:41:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 21:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-24"}

CPT is not possible for such a transition according to one-electron\ntheory because the magnetic sublevels form a V-type system, but in a\ntwo-electron atom like Yb, the interaction of the electrons transforms the\nlevel structure into a $ \\Lambda $-type system, which allows the formation of a\ndark state and hence the observation of CPT. Since the two levels involved are\ndegenerate, we use a magnetic field to lift the degeneracy. The single\nfluorescence dip then splits into five dips---the central unshifted one\ncorresponds to coherent population oscillation, while the outer four are due to\nCPT. The linewidth of the CPT resonance is about 300 kHz and is limited by the\nnatural linewidth of the excited state, which is to be expected because the\nexcited state is involved in the formation of the dark state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2014 11:35:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2015 05:26:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-02"}
