Second, we\nshow that for a relevant subclass of systems, persistency of excitation of a\nfunction of time in the right-hand side of the equations governing dynamics of\nthe system ensure existence of an attractor basin such that solutions passing\nthrough this basin in forward time converge to the origin exponentially.\nFinally we demonstrate that conditions developed in (A.N.

We utilised the HST WFC3/IR NIR imaging\nfrom CANDELS and HUDF09, reaching H~27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2,\nin combination with associated deep HST ACS optical data, deep Spitzer IRAC\nimaging from the SEDS programme, and deep Y and K-band VLT Hawk-I images from\nthe HUGS programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometric\nredshifts. These have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopic\nredshifts in the range 3.5<z<7.5, resulting in an overall precision of\nsigma_z/(1+z)~0.037. We have determined the low-mass end of the high-z GSMF\nwith unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as M*~10^9 Msun at\nz=4 and ~6x10^9 Msun at z=7. We find that the GSMF at 3.5<z<7.5 depends only\nslightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely the\nphoto-z, the SFHs, the nebular contribution or the presence of AGN on the\nparent sample. The low-mass end of the GSMF is steeper than has been found at\nlower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probed\nhere. Our results are very different from previous GSMF estimates based on\nconverting UV galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight M/L\nrelations. Integrating our evolving GSMF over mass, we find that the growth of\nstellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the SFR\ndensity over cosmic time at z>4.

Within recent decades,\nthe manner in which noise affects the collective behavior of self-organized\nsystems, specifically, has garnered considerable interest from researchers and\ndevelopers in various fields. To describe the collective motion of multiple\ninteracting particles, Vicsek et al. proposed a well-known self-propelled\nparticle (SPP) system, which exhibits a second-order phase transition from\ndisordered to ordered motion in simulation; due to its non-equilibrium,\nrandomness, and strong coupling nonlinear dynamics, however, there has been no\nrigorous analysis of such a system to date. To decouple systems consisting of\ndeterministic laws and randomness, we propose a general method which transfers\nthe analysis of these systems to the design of cooperative control algorithms.\nIn this study, we rigorously analyzed the original Vicsek model under both open\nand periodic boundary conditions for the first time, and developed extensions\nto heterogeneous SPP systems (including leaderfollower models) using the\nproposed method. Theoretical results show that SPP systems switch an infinite\nnumber of times between ordered and disordered states for any noise intensity\nand population density, which implies that the phase transition indeed takes a\nnontraditional form.

Complex irreversible\nprocesses arise from the coupling effects between simple irreversible\nprocesses. Each simple irreversible process is assiciated with an entropy or\nenergy density function. During complex irreversible processes with multiple\nfields present, this entropy or energy density function is assumed to be\ndependent on all independent field variables. Using the total entropy\nfunctionals, the TE effects and TDMT are analysed and important kinetic\ncoefficients such as the Seebeck coefficient and the heat of transport are\ndetermined with straightforward physical contents. Using the total energy\nfunctionals, the linear irreversible processes are analysed with the Onsager\napproach and the nonlinear irreversible processes with PFVA. It is found both\nthe Onsager's relations and the fluxes defined using PFVA guarantee the\nsatisfaction of the first law of thermodynamics during the process of\nconversion of energies. To analyze the diffusion process under the influence of\nelasticity, PFVA is also modified to incorporate the reversible evolution of\nelastic fields. It is shown energies are conserved via both the irreversible\ndiffusion process and the reversible evolution of the elastic fields. Finally,\nPFVA is generalized to study nonequilibrium thermodynamics using an extra\nkinetic contribution to the entropy density function. The analyses can be\nextended to a nonequilibrium thermodynamic system with multiple physical fields\npresent.

The boundary conditions for this equation are\nknown and the inverse problem of reconstruction of the coefficient of ODE1 from\nthe boundary conditions is formulated. This problem is called the OE-equation.\nThe OE-equation is solved by a simple numerical algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 18:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-24"}

In an attempt to classify them we get to achieve deep\nunderstanding of how they work. We show that the many countermeasures that we\nstudy (and their variations) actually share a number of common features, but\noptimize them in different ways. We also show that there is no conceptual\ndistinction between test-based and infective countermeasures and how either one\ncan be transformed into the other. Furthermore, we show that faults on the code\n(skipping instructions) can be captured by considering only faults on the data.\nThese intermediate results allow us to improve the state of the art in several\nways: (a) we fix an existing and that was known to be broken countermeasure\n(namely the one from Shamir); (b) we drastically optimize an existing\ncountermeasure (namely the one from Vigilant) which we reduce to 3 tests\ninstead of 9 in its original version, and prove that it resists not only one\nfault but also an arbitrary number of randomizing faults; (c) we also show how\nto upgrade countermeasures to resist any given number of faults: given a\ncorrect first-order countermeasure, we present a way to design a prov-able\nhigh-order countermeasure (for a well-defined and reasonable fault model).\nFinally, we pave the way for a generic approach against fault attacks for any\nmodular arithmetic computations, and thus for the automatic insertion of\ncountermeasures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 19:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

We find\nthat the distribution of PU sizes is close to lognormal. We analyze the\nmathematical model of evolution of brain parcellation based on iterative\nfragmentation and specialization. In this model, each existing PU has a\nprobability to be split that depends on PU size only. This model shows that the\nsame evolutionary process may have led to brain parcellation in these three\nspecies. Our model suggests that region-to-region (macro) connectivity is given\nby the outer product form. We show that most experimental data on non-vanishing\nmacaque cortex macroconnectivity (62% for area V1) can be explained by the\nouter product power-law form suggested by our model. We propose a\nmultiplicative Hebbian learning rule for the macroconnectome that could yield\nthe correct scaling of connection strengths between areas.

Relying on interference,\nthis all-optical, coherent scheme requires no additional control fields, and\ncan therefore form the basis for scalable quantum networks composed of passive\nquantum nodes that interact with each other only with single photon pulses.\nHere we present an analytical and numerical study of SPRINT, and characterise\nits limitations and the parameters for optimal operation.

The signal of\ninterest and the side information are each assumed to have (distinct) latent\ndiscrete labels; conditioned on these two labels, the signal of interest and\nside information are drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. With\njoint probabilities on the latent labels, the overall signal-(side information)\nrepresentation is defined by a Gaussian mixture model.

For patch-based classification on MINC we found that the best\nperforming CNN architectures can achieve 85.2% mean class accuracy. We convert\nthese trained CNN classifiers into an efficient fully convolutional framework\ncombined with a fully connected conditional random field (CRF) to predict the\nmaterial at every pixel in an image, achieving 73.1% mean class accuracy. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that having a large, well-sampled dataset such as MINC\nis crucial for real-world material recognition and segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 20:11:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 05:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-15"}

Handling this complex\necosystem is becoming a challenging issue, and wireless virtualization emerges\nas an efficient solution. Although the inclusion of virtualization in wireless\nnetworks ensures a better use of resources, current approaches adopted for\nwireless virtualization can cause an underutilization of resources, since the\nresource allocated to a virtual wireless network is not shared with other one.\nThis problem can be overcome by combining wireless virtualization with the\ncognitive radio (CR) technology and dynamic access spectrum (DSA) techniques.\nThus, virtual wireless networks with different access priorities to resources\n(e.g., primary and secondary) can be deployed in an overlay form and share the\nsame substrate wireless network, where the secondary networks use the resources\nopportunistically. However, challenges emerge in this new scenario, ranging\nfrom the mapping to the operation of these networks. This paper is the first to\npropose the cognitive radio virtual network environment and to formulate the\nproblem of mapping the secondary virtual networks (SVNs) onto the wireless\nsubstrate network based on CR. To this end, a multi-objective formulation is\ndesigned. Moreover, an analysis of the metrics defined in the problem is\nperformed in order to give the reader useful assistance in designing schemes to\nsolve the problem of mapping SVNs onto substrate networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 20:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

The resulting redshift uncertainties inhibit\nthe efficient search for [C II] in z~7 galaxies with sub-mm instruments such as\nALMA, given their limited scan speed for faint lines. One means by which to\nimprove the precision of the inferred redshifts is to exploit the potential\nimpact of strong nebular emission lines on the colors of z~4-8 galaxies as\nobserved by Spitzer/IRAC. At z~6.8, galaxies exhibit IRAC colors as blue as\n[3.6]-[4.5] ~-1, likely due to the contribution of [O III]+Hb to the 3.6 mum\nflux combined with the absence of line contamination in the 4.5 mum band. In\nthis paper we explore the use of extremely blue [3.6]-[4.5] colors to identify\ngalaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-6.9. When combined with an\nI-dropout criterion, we demonstrate that we can plausibly select a relatively\nclean sample of z~6.8 galaxies. Through a systematic application of this\nselection technique to our catalogs from all five CANDELS fields, we identify\n20 probable z~6.6-6.9 galaxies. We estimate that our criteria select the ~50%\nstrongest line emitters at z~6.8 and from the IRAC colors we estimate a typical\n[O III]+Hb rest-frame equivalent width of 1085A for this sample. The small\nredshift uncertainties on our sample make it particularly well suited for\nfollow-up studies with facilities such as ALMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 21:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In this paper, we test whether or not similar\ndynamical phenomena occur in glassy systems composed of binary hard ellipses.\nWe demonstrate via event-driven molecular dynamics simulation that a binary\nhard-ellipse mixture with an aspect ratio of two and moderate size disparity\ndisplays characteristic glassy dynamics upon increasing density in both the\ntranslational and the rotational degrees of freedom. The rotational glass\ntransition density is found to be close to the translational one for the binary\nmixtures investigated. More importantly, we assess the influence of size\ndisparity and mixture's composition on the relaxation dynamics. We find that an\nincrease of size disparity leads, both translationally and rotationally, to a\nspeed up of the long-time dynamics in the supercooled regime so that both the\ntranslational and the rotational glass transition shift to higher densities. By\nincreasing the number concentration of the small particles, the time evolution\nof both translational and rotational relaxation dynamics at high densities\ndisplays two qualitatively different scenarios, i.e., both the initial and the\nfinal part of the structural relaxation slow down for small size disparity,\nwhile the short-time dynamics still slows down but the final decay speeds up in\nthe binary mixture with large size disparity. These findings are reminiscent of\nthose observed in binary hard spherical particles. Therefore, our results\nsuggest a universal mechanism for the influence of size disparity and mixture's\ncomposition on the structural relaxation in both isotropic and anisotropic\nparticle systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 21:52:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

Under suitable\nassumptions, we show that well-posedness of the submartingale problem is\nequivalent to existence and uniqueness in law of weak solutions to the\ncorresponding stochastic differential equation with reflection.

This paper uses a stochastic geometry approach to characterize the\none-way and two-way signal-to-interference ratio distribution of a mmWave ad\nhoc network with directional antennas, random blockages, and ALOHA channel\naccess. The interference-to-noise ratio shows that a fundamental limitation of\nan ad hoc network, interference, may still be an issue. The performance of\nmmWave ad hoc networks is bounded by the transmission capacity and area\nspectral efficiency. The results show that mmWave networks can support much\nhigher densities and larger spectral efficiencies, even in the presence of\nblockage, compared with lower frequency communication for certain link\ndistances.

The\nmotivation comes from studies of human brain development, in which $t$ denotes\nage whereas $s$ refers to brain locations. Analogously to varying-coefficient\nmodels, in which the mean response is linear in $t$, the \"varying-smoother\"\nmodels that we consider exhibit nonlinear dependence on $t$ that varies\nsmoothly with $s$. We discuss three approaches to estimating varying-smoother\nmodels: (a) methods that employ a tensor product penalty; (b) an approach based\non smoothed functional principal component scores; and (c) two-step methods\nconsisting of an initial smooth with respect to $t$ at each $s$, followed by a\npostprocessing step. For the first approach, we derive an exact expression for\na penalty proposed by Wood, and an adaptive penalty that allows smoothness to\nvary more flexibly with $s$.

Further, a number of different intracellular and\nmicroenvironmental factors have been correlated with the emergence of drug\nresistance. With the goal of better understanding drug resistance and its\nconnection with the tumor microenvironment, we have developed a hybrid\ndiscrete-continuous mathematical model. In this model, cancer cells described\nthrough a particle-spring approach respond to dynamically changing oxygen and\nDNA damaging drug concentrations described through partial differential\nequations. We thoroughly explored the behavior of our self-calibrated model\nunder the following common conditions: a fixed layout of the vasculature, an\nidentical initial configuration of cancer cells, the same mechanism of drug\naction, and one mechanism of cellular response to the drug. We considered one\nset of simulations in which drug resistance existed prior to the start of\ntreatment, and another set in which drug resistance is acquired in response to\ntreatment. This allows us to compare how both kinds of resistance influence the\nspatial and temporal dynamics of the developing tumor, and its clonal\ndiversity.

SNe Iax have been\nestimated to account for ~5-30% of the total SN Ia rate, and most SNe Iax have\nbeen discovered in late-type galaxies. In addition, observations constrain the\nprogenitor systems of some SN Iax progenitors have ages of <80Myr. Recently,\nthe weak deflagration explosions of Ch-mass CO WDs seem to provide a viable\nphysical scenario for SNe Iax. Here, comparing theoretical predictions from BPS\ncalculations with SN Iax observations, we put constraints on the SD Ch-mass\nmodel as a possible Iax progenitor. A long delay times of >3Gyr and low SN\nrates of ~3e-5/yr are found in our RG donor channel, indicating that this\nchannel is unlikely to produce SNe Iax. We predict that the Galactic rate from\nthe MS (He) donor channel is ~1.5e-3/yr (3e-4/yr), which is consistent with the\nobserved Iax rate. The short delay times in the He channel support the young\nhost environments of SNe Iax. However, the relative long delay times in the MS\ndonor channel are less favourable for the observational constraints on the Iax\nprogenitor ages. Finally, we set an upper limit on the pre-SN mass-loss rate at\n< 10e-4 M_sun/yr (for V_wind=100 km/s). The delay times in the SD Ch-mass model\ndo not account for that most SNe Iax are located in late-type galaxies.\nHowever, at least one Iax event (SN 2008ge) is hosted by a S0 galaxy with no\nsigns of star formation. Moreover, current X-ray observations cannot rule out\nthe SD Ch-mass model. Taking all these into account and considering the\nuncertainty of the observed rate for SNe Iax, we suggest that some SNe Iax may\nbe produced from weak deflagrations of Ch-mass CO WDs in SD progenitors,\nespecially in the He-star channel. This is consistent with recent analysis of\nHST observations for the SN Iax SN2012Z.

Most of these methods are designed to generate binary codes preserving\nthe Euclidean similarity in the original space. Manifold learning techniques,\nin contrast, are better able to model the intrinsic structure embedded in the\noriginal high-dimensional data. The complexities of these models, and the\nproblems with out-of-sample data, have previously rendered them unsuitable for\napplication to large-scale embedding, however. In this work, how to learn\ncompact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds is considered. In order\nto address the above-mentioned difficulties, an efficient, inductive solution\nto the out-of-sample data problem, and a process by which non-parametric\nmanifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method is proposed. The\nproposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing\ntechniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning\napproaches available. It is particularly shown that hashing on the basis of\nt-SNE outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods on large-scale benchmark\ndatasets, and is very effective for image classification with very short code\nlengths. The proposed hashing framework is shown to be easily improved, for\nexample, by minimizing the quantization error with learned orthogonal\nrotations. In addition, a supervised inductive manifold hashing framework is\ndeveloped by incorporating the label information, which is shown to greatly\nadvance the semantic retrieval performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 09:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Using radiation transport calculations, we\ncompute the line flux for two 3D explosion models: a near-Chandrasekhar mass\ndelayed detonation and a violent merger of two white dwarfs. Both models are\nbased on solar metallicity zero-age main sequence progenitors. Due to explosive\nnuclear burning at higher density, the delayed-detonation model synthesises 3.5\ntimes more radioactive 55Fe than the merger model. As a result, we find that\nthe peak Mn Kalpha line flux of the delayed-detonation model exceeds that of\nthe merger model by a factor of 4.5. Since in both models the 5.9 keV X-ray\nflux peaks five to six years after the explosion, a single measurement of the\nX-ray line emission at this time can place a constraint on the explosion\nphysics that is complementary to those derived from earlier phase optical\nspectra or light curves. We perform detector simulations of current and future\nX-ray telescopes to investigate the possibilities of detecting the X-ray line\nat 5.9 keV. For the delayed-detonation scenario, a line detection is feasible\nwith Chandra up to 3 Mpc for an exposure time of 10^6 s. We find that it should\nbe possible with currently existing X-ray instruments (with exposure times\n5x10^5 s) to detect both of our models at sufficiently high S/N to distinguish\nbetween them for hypothetical events within the Local Group. The prospects for\ndetection will be better with future missions. For example, the proposed\nAthena/X-IFU instrument could detect our delayed-detonation model out to a\ndistance of 5 Mpc. This would make it possible to study future events occurring\nduring its operational life at distances comparable to those of the recent\nsupernovae SN 2011fe (6.4 Mpc) and SN 2014J (3.5 Mpc).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 10:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

However, the difference between the\nrocking curve of the (002) and (110) peaks and the presence of pits/holes in\nthe step-terrace type surface morphology suggests high density of defect in\nthese films. Pronounced hysteresis between the field cool cooled (FCC) and\nfield cooled warming (FCW) magnetization measurements suggest towards the\nnon-ergodic magnetic state.

The large difference between the insulator metal transitions\nduring cooling and warming cycles (TIMC~64 K and TIMW~123 K) could be regarded\nas a manifestation of the nonergodicity leading to supercooling of the magnetic\nliquid while cooling.

We try to derive this distribution\nnumerically by taking into account the discreteness in both space and time of\noccurrences of supernova explosions where GCRs are suspected to be born. We\nsolve numerically the stochastic differential equations equivalent to the\nParker diffusion-convection equation which describes the propagation process of\nGCR in the Galaxy. We assume the three-dimensional diffusion is an isotropic\none without any free escape boundaries. We ignore any energy change of GCRs and\nthe existence of the Galactic wind for simplicity. We also assume axisymmetric\nconfigurations for the density distributions of the interstellar matter and for\nthe surface density of supernovae. We have calculated age and path length of\nGCR protons arriving at the solar system with this stochastic method. The\nobtained age is not the escape time of GCRs from the Galaxy as usually assumed,\nbut the time spent by GCRs during their journey to the solar system from the\nsupernova remnants where they were born. The derived age and path length show a\ndistribution spread in a wide range even for GCR protons arriving at the solar\nsystem with the same energy. The distributions show a cut-off at a lower range\nin age or path length depending on the energy of GCRs. These cut-offs clearly\ncome from the discreteness of occurrence of supernovae. The mean age of GeV\nparticles obtained from the distributions is consistent with the age obtained\nby direct observation of radioactive secondary nuclei. The energy dependence of\nthe B/C ratio estimated with the path length distribution reproduces reliably\nthe energy dependence of B/C obtained by recent observations in space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 13:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

Yet it has remained unsolved whether the oligomers\nare a necessary step in the formation of amyloid fibrils, or just a dangerous\nby-product. Analogously, it has not been resolved if the amyloid nucleation\nprocess is a classical one-step nucleation process, or a two-step process\ninvolving pre-nucleation clusters. We use coarse-grained computer simulations\nto study the effect of non-specific attractions between peptides on the primary\nnucleation process underlying amyloid fibrillization. We find that for peptides\nthat do not attract, the classical one-step nucleation mechanism is possible,\nbut only at non-physiologically high peptide concentrations. At low peptide\nconcentrations, which mimic the physiologically relevant regime, attractive\ninter-peptide interactions are essential for fibril formation. Nucleation then\ninevitably takes place through a two-step mechanism involving prefibrillar\noligomers. We show that oligomers not only help peptides meet each other, but\ncreate an environment that facilitates the conversion of monomers into the\n$\\beta$-sheet rich form characteristic of fibrils. Nucleation typically does\nnot proceed via the most prevalent oligomers, but via an oligomer size that is\nonly observed in rare fluctuations, which is why such aggregates might be hard\nto capture experimentally. Finally, we find that the nucleation of amyloid\nfibrils cannot be described by classical nucleation theory: in the two-step\nmechanism the critical nucleus size increases both with an increase in\nconcentration and in the inter-peptide interactions, in direct contrast with\npredictions from classical nucleation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 13:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

Our three-dimensional\ncharge-density analysis demonstrates that Friedel oscillations have maxima\nwhich are more spatially localized than what one-dimensional average density or\ntwo-dimensional cross sectional plots could possibly inform: The well-known\ncharge-density enhancement around the topmost surface layer of Mg(0001) is\nstrongly localized at its fcc hollow sites.

We observed the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) spectral\nlines with the IRAM 30m and NRO 45m telescopes for eight galaxies. They belong\nto a large sample of 37 local ETGs which host both RQ and RL AGN.

We report the new\ndetection of CO(1-0) emission in four galaxies (UGC0968, UGC5617, UGC6946, and\nUGC8355) and CO(2-1) emission in two of them (UGC0968 and UGC5617).

For future spintronic devices it\nis important to understand the behavior of the spins and the limitations for\nspin transport in structures where the dimensions are smaller than the spin\nrelaxation length. However, the study of spin injection and transport in\ngraphene nanostructures is highly unexplored. Here we study the spin injection\nand relaxation in nanostructured graphene with dimensions smaller than the spin\nrelaxation length. For graphene nanoislands, where the edge length to area\nratio is much higher than for standard devices, we show that enhanced spin-flip\nprocesses at the edges do not seem to play a major role in the spin relaxation.\nOn the other hand, contact induced spin relaxation has a much more dramatic\neffect for these low dimensional structures.

As a proof of concept, we electrically\nsynthesize four different elementary nanomechanical waveforms from a\nfundamental surface acoustic wave at $ f_1 \\sim 150$ MHz using a superposition\nof up to three discrete harmonics $f_n$. We employ these shaped pulses to\ninteract with an individual sensor quantum dot and detect their deliberately\nand temporally modulated strain component via the opto-mechanical quantum dot\nresponse. Importantly, and in contrast to the direct mechanical actuation by\nbulk piezoactuators, surface acoustic waves provide much higher frequencies (>\n20 GHz) to resonantly drive mechanical motion. Thus, our technique uniquely\nallows coherent mechanical control of localized vibronic modes of\noptomechanical crystals, even in the quantum limit when cooled to the\nvibrational ground state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 08:56:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 08:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

By stable, we refer\nto the classical stability condition for the AR model. By consistent, we refer\nto the classical consistency constraints of Adams-Bashforth methods of\norder-two. One attractive feature of this algebraic method is that the model\nparameters can be obtained without directly knowing any training data set as\nopposed to many standard, regression-based parameterization methods. It takes\nonly long-time average statistics as inputs. The proposed method provides a\ndiscretization time step interval which guarantees the existence of stable and\nconsistent AR model and simultaneously produces the parameters for the AR\nmodels. In our numerical examples with two chaotic time series with different\ncharacteristics of decaying time scales, we find that the proposed AR models\nproduce significantly more accurate short-term predictive skill and comparable\nfiltering skill relative to the linear regression-based AR models. These\nencouraging results are robust across wide ranges of discretization times,\nobservation times, and observation noise variances. Finally, we also find that\nthe proposed model produces an improved short-time prediction relative to the\nlinear regression-based AR-models in forecasting a data set that characterizes\nthe variability of the Madden-Julian Oscillation, a dominant tropical\natmospheric wave pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 12:56:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-19"}

It is generally assumed that the folk theorem, which is\nthe fundamental theory for non-cooperative games, defines all Nash equilibria\nin infinitely repeated games. Here, we prove that Nash equilibria that are not\ncharacterised by the folk theorem do exist. By adopting specific reactive\nstrategies, a group of players can be better off by coordinating their actions\nin repeated games. We call it a type-k equilibrium when a group of k players\ncoordinate their actions and they have no incentive to deviate from their\nstrategies simultaneously. The existence and stability of the type-k\nequilibrium in general games is discussed. This study shows that the sets of\nNash equilibria and evolutionarily stable states have greater cardinality than\nclassic game theory has predicted in many repeated games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 14:34:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2015 10:33:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 14:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-08"}

In order to theoretically determine\nthe geometric specific surface area and relationships between geometrical\nparameters of isotropic open cell foams, a generalized mathematical correlation\nwas developed. For this purpose the tetrakaidecahedron geometry was used and\ndifferent shapes of strut cross-sections of foam structures were taken\nexplicitly into account. The derived correlation to predict geometrical\nproperties can be easily extended to different strut shapes. 3-D numerical\nsimulations at pore scale were performed to study the pressure drop\ncharacteristics and effective thermal conductivity. Fluid flow through open\ncell foam was performed in three different regimes: Darcy regime, transition\nregime and inertia regime. Importance of geometrical properties on fluid flow\ncharacteristics and their inclusion in the proposed correlations for predicting\npressure drop is discussed. Can Ergun parameters have constant numerical values\nor not is also extensively discussed. Three different correlations were derived\nto predict the effective thermal conductivity for both, isotropic and\nanisotropic open cell foams. Geometrical parameters of foam matrix were\nintroduced in the correlations to predict effective thermal conductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 08:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-23"}

The present research effort\nis driven by the continued interest in achieving low cost, reliable access to\nspace and more recently, by the renewed interest in hypersonic transportation\nsystems capable of reducing time-to-destination. Moreover, combustion at high\npressure has been assumed as a key issue to achieve better propulsive\nperformance and lower environmental impact, as long as the replacement of\nhydrogen with a hydrocarbon, to reduce the costs related to ground operations\nand increase flexibility. The current work provides a model for the numerical\nsimulation of high- pressure turbulent combustion employing detailed chemistry\ndescription, embedded in a RANS equations solver with a Low Reynolds number\nk-omega turbulence model. The model used to study such a combustion phenomenon\nis an extension of the standard flamelet-progress-variable (FPV) turbulent\ncombustion model combined with a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equation\nSolver (RANS). In the FPV model, all of the thermo-chemical quantities are\nevaluated by evolving the mixture fraction Z and a progress variable C. When\nusing a turbulence model in conjunction with FPV model, a probability density\nfunction (PDF) is required to evaluate statistical averages of chemical\nquantities. The choice of such PDF must be a compromise between computational\ncosts and accuracy level. State- of-the-art FPV models are built presuming the\nfunctional shape of the joint PDF of Z and C in order to evaluate\nFavre-averages of thermodynamic quantities. The model here proposed evaluates\nthe most probable joint distribution of Z and C without any assumption on their\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 10:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-19"}
