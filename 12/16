The real moist\nconvection should be strongest in the belts where the interface to the deep\nflow is highest and coldest, and should generate cyclones as well as\nanticyclones with the anticyclones systematically stronger. The new model\nforcing reflects these insights. Also, it acts quasifrictionally on large\nscales to produce statistically steady turbulent weather-layer regimes without\nany need for explicit large-scale dissipation, and with weather-layer jets that\nare approximately straight thanks to the influence of the deep jets, allowing\nshear stability despite nonmonotonic potential-vorticity gradients when the\nRossby deformation lengthscale is not too large. Moderately strong forcing\nproduces chaotic vortex dynamics and realistic belt-zone contrasts in the\nmodel's convective activity, through an eddy-induced sharpening and\nstrengthening of the weather-layer jets relative to the deep jets, tilting the\ninterface between them. Weak forcing, for which the only jet-sharpening\nmechanism is the passive (Kelvin) shearing of vortices (as in the \"CE2\" or\n\"SSST\" theories), produces unrealistic belt-zone contrasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 17:24:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 16:45:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 08:05:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 11:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-29"}

We herein report a comprehensive first-principles study of defect\nphysics in LiMnO$_2$ and Li$_2$MnO$_3$ using hybrid-density functional\ncalculations. We find that manganese antisites have low formation energies in\nLiMnO$_2$ and may act as nucleation sites for the formation of impurity phases.\nThe antisites can also occur with high concentrations in Li$_2$MnO$_3$;\nhowever, unlike in LiMnO$_2$, they can be eliminated by tuning the experimental\nconditions during preparation.

An analysis of the\nformation of lithium vacancies indicates that lithium extraction from LiMnO$_2$\nis associated with oxidation at the manganese site, resulting in the formation\nof manganese small hole polarons; whereas in Li$_2$MnO$_3$ the intrinsic\ndelithiation mechanism involves oxidation at the oxygen site, leading to the\nformation of bound oxygen hole polarons $\\eta_{\\rm O}^{+}$. The layered oxides\nare found to have no or negligible bandlike carriers and they cannot be doped\nn- or p-type.

This resonant clumping, due to the\nin-phase motion of the particles through their epicycle, leads to both inward\nand outward moving groups which belong to the same orbital family and\nconsequently produce bimodal radial velocity distributions.

In this paper, we present an improved model of the HI galaxy number\ncounts and bias from semi-analytic simulations, and use it to calculate the\nexpected yield of HI galaxies from surveys with a variety of Phase 1 and 2 SKA\nconfigurations. We illustrate the relative performance of the different surveys\nby forecasting errors on the radial and transverse scales of the baryon\nacoustic oscillation (BAO) feature, finding that the full \"billion galaxy\nsurvey\" with SKA2 will deliver the largest dark energy figure of merit of any\ncurrent or future large-scale structure survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 17:52:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 19:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-08"}

A recent simulation study showed that\nunder increased fire regimes positive tree-tree interactions were recorded\n(Bacelar et al., 2014). Data from experimental burning plots in an African\nsavanna, the Kruger National Park, were collected across unburnt and annual\nburn plots. Indices of aggregation and spatial autocorrelation of the\ndistribution of trees between different fire regimes were explored. Results\nshow that the distribution of trees under fire were more clumped and exhibited\nhigher spatial autocorrelation than in unburnt plots: In burnt plots spatial\nautocorrelation values were positive at finer scales and negative at coarser\nscales potentially indicating co-existence of facilitation and competition\nwithin the same ecosystem depending on the scale. The pattern derived here\nprovides inference for (a) fire acting as an increasing aggregation & spatial\nautocorrelation force (b) tree survival under fire regimes is potentially\nfacilitated by forming patches of trees (c) scale-dependent facilitation and\ncompetition coexisting within the same ecosystem with finer scale facilitation\nand coarser scale competition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 17:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}

A sound theoretical understanding of dropout is needed to\ndetermine when dropout should be applied and how to use it most effectively. In\nthis paper we continue the exploration of dropout as a regularizer pioneered by\nWager, et.al. We focus on linear classification where a convex proxy to the\nmisclassification loss (i.e. the logistic loss used in logistic regression) is\nminimized. We show: (a) when the dropout-regularized criterion has a unique\nminimizer, (b) when the dropout-regularization penalty goes to infinity with\nthe weights, and when it remains bounded, (c) that the dropout regularization\ncan be non-monotonic as individual weights increase from 0, and (d) that the\ndropout regularization penalty may not be convex. This last point is\nparticularly surprising because the combination of dropout regularization with\nany convex loss proxy is always a convex function.\n  In order to contrast dropout regularization with $L_2$ regularization, we\nformalize the notion of when different sources are more compatible with\ndifferent regularizers. We then exhibit distributions that are provably more\ncompatible with dropout regularization than $L_2$ regularization, and vice\nversa. These sources provide additional insight into how the inductive biases\nof dropout and $L_2$ regularization differ.

A widely used measure of scientific\nimpact is citations, with a growing body of literature focused on predicting\nthe number of citations obtained by any given publication. The effectiveness of\nsuch predictions, however, is fundamentally limited by the power-law\ndistribution of citations, whereby publications with few citations are\nextremely common and publications with many citations are relatively rare.\nGiven this limitation, in this work we instead address a related question asked\nby many academic researchers in the course of writing a paper, namely: \"Will\nthis paper increase my h-index?\" Using a real academic dataset with over 1.7\nmillion authors, 2 million papers, and 8 million citation relationships from\nthe premier online academic service ArnetMiner, we formalize a novel scientific\nimpact prediction problem to examine several factors that can drive a paper to\nincrease the primary author's h-index. We find that the researcher's authority\non the publication topic and the venue in which the paper is published are\ncrucial factors to the increase of the primary author's h-index, while the\ntopic popularity and the co-authors' h-indices are of surprisingly little\nrelevance. By leveraging relevant factors, we find a greater than 87.5%\npotential predictability for whether a paper will contribute to an author's\nh-index within five years. As a further experiment, we generate a\nself-prediction for this paper, estimating that there is a 76% probability that\nit will contribute to the h-index of the co-author with the highest current\nh-index in five years. We conclude that our findings on the quantification of\nscientific impact can help researchers to expand their influence and more\neffectively leverage their position of \"standing on the shoulders of giants.\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 20:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}

The Pipe nebula is a molecular cloud that lacks star formation\nfeedback and has a relatively simple morphology and velocity structure. This\nmakes it an ideal target to test cloud evolution through collisions. Aims. We\naim at drawing a comprehensive picture of this relatively simple cloud to\nbetter understand the formation and evolution of molecular clouds on large\nscales. Methods. We use archival data to compare the optical polarization\nproperties, the visual extinction, and the 13CO velocities and linewidths of\nthe entire cloud in order to identify trends among the observables. Results.\nThe Pipe nebula can be roughly divided in two filaments with different\norientations and gas velocity ranges: E-W at 2-4 km s-1 and N-S at 6-7 km s-1.\nThe two filaments overlap at the bowl, where the gas shows a velocity gradient\nspanning from 2 to 7 km s-1. Compared to the rest of the Pipe nebula, the bowl\ngas appears to be denser and exhibits larger linewidths. In addition, the\npolarization data at the bowl shows lower angular dispersion and higher\npolarization degree. Cores in the bowl tend to cluster in space and tend to\nfollow the 13CO velocity gradient. In the stem, cores tend to cluster in\nregions with properties similar to those of the bowl. Conclusions. The velocity\npattern points to a collision between the filaments in the bowl region. The\nmagnetic field seems to be compressed and strengthened in the shocked region.\nThe proportional increase of density and magnetic field strength by a factor\nsimilar to the Alfv\\'enic Mach number suggests a continuous shock at low\nAlfv\\'enic Mach number under flux-freezing. Shocked regions seem to enhance the\nformation and clustering of dense cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 21:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-28"}

In\nparticular, the small width of the Higgs boson makes its decay uniquely\nsensitive to the existence of light hidden sectors. Here we assess the\npotential of an exotic Higgs decay search for h -> 2X -> bbmumu to constrain\ntheories with light CP-even (X = s) and CP-odd (X = a) singlet scalars in the\nmass range of 15 to 60 GeV.

The 2b2mu channel may represent the best discovery avenue for many\nmodels. It has competitive reach, and is less reliant on low-pT b- and\ntau-reconstruction compared to other channels like 4b, 4tau, and 2tau2mu. We\nanalyze the sensitivity of a 2b2mu search for the 8 and 14 TeV LHC, including\nthe HL-LHC. We consider three types of analyses, employing conventional\nresolved b-jets with a clustering radius of R ~ 0.4, thin b-jets with R=0.2,\nand jet substructure techniques, respectively. The latter two analyses improve\nthe reach for m_X ~ 15 GeV, for which the two b-jets are boosted and often\nmerged. We find that Br(h -> 2X -> 2b2mu) can be constrained at the few x 10^-5\nlevel across the entire considered mass range of X at the HL-LHC. This\ncorresponds to a 1 - 10% reach in Br(h->2X) in 2HDM+S models, including the\nNMSSM, depending on the type of Higgs Yukawa couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 21:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 22:38:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2015 07:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}

The TNT dwarf pairs span mass ratios of M1/M2 <10, projected\nseparations <50 kpc, and pair member masses of 7< log(M_*/Msun) <9.7. The\ndwarf-dwarf merger sequence, as defined by TNT, demonstrates conclusively and\nfor the first time that the star formation enhancement observed for massive\ngalaxy pairs also extends to dwarfs. Star formation is enhanced in paired\ndwarfs in otherwise isolated environments by a factor of 2.3 (+/- 0.7) at pair\nseparations < 50 kpc relative to unpaired analogs. Starbursts, with Ha EQW >100\nA, occur in 20% of TNT dwarf pairs, regardless of environment, compared to only\n6-8% of matched unpaired dwarfs. Starbursts can be triggered throughout the\nmerger (out to large pair separations) and not just approaching coalescence.\nDespite their enhanced star formation, most TNT dwarf pairs have similar gas\nfractions relative to unpaired dwarfs. Thus, there may be significant\nreservoirs of diffuse, non-starforming gas surrounding the dwarf pairs or the\ngas consumption timescales may be long in the starburst phase. The only TNT\ndwarf pairs with low gas fractions (fgas <0.4) and the only dwarfs with Ha EQW\n<2 A are found near massive galaxy hosts. Thus, dwarf-dwarf interactions are\nsignificant drivers of dwarf galaxy evolution, but ultimately environment is\nresponsible for the quenching of star formation. This work is a precursor to an\nongoing high resolution HI and optical imaging program to constrain the spatial\ndistribution of star formation and gas throughout the dwarf-dwarf merger\nsequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 21:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

Without~abandoning classical\nelectromagnetism or standard cosmology, we demonstrate that this is not\nnecessarily the case for superhorizon-sized magnetic fields. The underlying\nreason for this is causality, which confines the post-inflationary process of\nelectric-current formation, electric-field elimination and magnetic-flux\nfreezing within the horizon. As a result, the adiabatic magnetic decay is not\na~priori guaranteed on super-Hubble scales. Instead, after inflation,\nlarge-scale magnetic fields obey a~power-law solution, where one of the modes\ndrops at a rate slower than the adiabatic. Whether this slowly decaying mode\ncan dominate and dictate the post-inflationary magnetic evolution depends on\nthe initial conditions. These are determined by the evolution of the field\nduring inflation and by the nature of the transition from the de Sitter phase\nto the reheating era and then to the subsequent epochs of radiation and dust.\nWe discuss two alternative and complementary scenarios to illustrate the role\nand the implications of the initial conditions for cosmic magnetogenesis.

We analyze the origin of the\nbreaking of BRST symmetry in the GZ model, and obtain a useful sufficient\ncondition that determines which operators preserve BRST. Observables of the GZ\ntheory are required to be invariant under a certain group of symmetries that\nincludes not only BRST but also others.

We take as a hypothesis that BRST symmetry is unbroken by this\nclass of observables. If the hypothesis holds, BRST breaking is relegated to\nthe unphysical sector of the GZ theory, and its physical states are obtained by\nthe usual cohomological BRST construction.

These expressions\nare validated against numerically-generated synthetic populations of ejecta\nunder lunar surface gravity. The model is applied to the cases where the\nejection speed distribution is (a) uniform (b) a power law. For the latter law,\nit is found that the effective scale height of the ejecta envelope directly\ndepends on the exponent of the power law and increases with altitude. The same\nholds for the speed distribution of particles near the surface. Ejection model\nparameters can, therefore, be constrained through orbital and surface\nmeasurements.

The Similarity SQL-based Group-By\noperator (SGB, for short) extends the semantics of the standard SQL Group-by by\ngrouping data with similar but not necessarily equal values. While existing\nsimilarity-based grouping operators efficiently materialize this approximate\nsemantics, they primarily focus on one-dimensional attributes and treat\nmultidimensional attributes independently. However, correlated attributes, such\nas in spatial data, are processed independently, and hence, groups in the\nmultidimensional space are not detected properly. To address this problem, we\nintroduce two new SGB operators for multidimensional data. The first operator\nis the clique (or distance-to-all) SGB, where all the tuples in a group are\nwithin some distance from each other. The second operator is the\ndistance-to-any SGB, where a tuple belongs to a group if the tuple is within\nsome distance from any other tuple in the group. We implement and test the new\nSGB operators and their algorithms inside PostgreSQL. The overhead introduced\nby these operators proves to be minimal and the execution times are comparable\nto those of the standard Group-by. The experimental study, based on TPC-H and a\nsocial check-in data, demonstrates that the proposed algorithms can achieve up\nto three orders of magnitude enhancement in performance over baseline methods\ndeveloped to solve the same problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 00:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-17"}

We use a\nmodel with several new or up-dated ingredients (atomic and molecular gas\nphases, star formation depending on molecular gas, recent sets of\nmetallicity-dependent stellar yields from H to Ni, observationally inferred\nSNIa rates), which reproduces well most global and local observables of the\nMilky Way.

We find a correlation between the stellar abundance\nprofiles and O/Fe, which is a proxy for stellar age. Our final abundance\nprofiles are in overall agreement with observations, but slightly steeper (by\n0.01-0.02 dex/kpc) for elements above S. We find an interesting \"odd-even\neffect\" in the behaviour of the abundance profiles (steeper slopes for odd\nelements) for all sets of stellar yields; however, this behaviour does not\nappear in observations, suggesting that the effect is, perhaps, overestimated\nin current stellar nucleosynthesis calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 02:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

In a\ncommonly used simulation technique in ultracold atoms and quantum optics, known\nas the truncated Wigner method, the quantum dynamics is mapped to stochastic\ntrajectories in phase space, governed by a positive approximation to the true\nWigner distribution. The question thus arises: how accurate is this approach in\npredicting truly non-classical behaviour? In this article, we benchmark the\nability of the truncated Wigner phase-space method to reproduce the\nnon-Gaussian statistics of the single mode anharmonic oscillator. We find that\nthe this method can reliably predict departures from Gaussian statistics over a\nwide range of particle numbers, whereas the positive-P representation method,\nwhich is in principle exact, can suffer from divergent instabilities. The\ntruncated Wigner function, furthermore, is able to reproduce the non-Gaussian\ncorrelations while satisfying the condition for purity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 03:28:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Feb 2015 02:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

While being\nconceptually and computationally appealing, this method involves the\nproblematic need to also split the prior for the local inferences; these\nweakened priors may not provide enough regularization for each separate\ncomputation, thus eliminating one of the key advantages of Bayesian methods. To\nresolve this dilemma while still retaining the generalizability of the\nunderlying local inference method, we apply the idea of expectation propagation\n(EP) as a framework for distributed Bayesian inference. The central idea is to\niteratively update approximations to the local likelihoods given the state of\nthe other approximations and the prior. The present paper has two roles: we\nreview the steps that are needed to keep EP algorithms numerically stable, and\nwe suggest a general approach, inspired by EP, for approaching data\npartitioning problems in a way that achieves the computational benefits of\nparallelism while allowing each local update to make use of relevant\ninformation from the other sites.

In the frame of the\nproposed model, the apparent disorders observed on the STM images, would be\ntopological effects, i.e. the silicene would keep a quasi-perfect honeycomb\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 07:52:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 19:13:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 10:11:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 14:28:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 14:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

To understand better geometric quantum discord,\nthis paper is devoted to compare it with quantum discord and measurement\ninduced non-locality that is in some sense dual to the geometric quantum\ndiscord. As studying the quantum correlation experimentally is one of the\nimportant thing in quantum information processing, so as our example for\nillustrating the difference of geometric quantum discord, quantum discord and\nmeasurement induced non-locality, our quantum system is a dimer (two spin-1/2\nparticles) in multiple quantum nuclear magnetic resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 08:13:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 11:46:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 09:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

Different\napproaches have been adopted to simulate pedestrian movement under various\ncircumstances and interactions. In the present work, bi-directional crowd\nmovement is simulated where an equal numbers of individuals try to reach the\nopposite sides of an environment. Two movement methods are considered. First a\nLeast Effort Model (LEM) is investigated where agents try to take an optimal\npath with as minimal changes from their intended path as possible. Following\nthis, a modified form of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is proposed, where\nindividuals are guided by a goal of reaching the other side in a least effort\nmode as well as a pheromone trail left by predecessors. The basic idea is to\nincrease agent interaction, thereby more closely reflecting a real world\nscenario. The methodology utilizes Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for general\npurpose computing using the CUDA platform. Because of the inherent parallel\nproperties associated with pedestrian movement such as proximate interactions\nof individuals on a 2D grid, GPUs are well suited. The main feature of the\nimplementation undertaken here is that the parallelism is data driven. The data\ndriven implementation leads to a speedup up to 18x compared to its sequential\ncounterpart running on a single threaded CPU. The numbers of pedestrians\nconsidered in the model ranged from 2K to 100K representing numbers typical of\nmass gathering events. A detailed discussion addresses implementation\nchallenges faced and averted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 10:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-17"}

We consider here a scenario of practical importance\nto wireless communications, in which one or more nodes are located outside the\nconvex space where the remaining nodes reside. We call these `external nodes',\nand assume that they play some essential role in the macro network\nfunctionality e.g. a gateway to a dense self-contained mesh network cloud.\nConventional approaches with the underlying assumption of only line-of-sight\n(LOS) or direct connections between nodes, fail to provide the correct analysis\nfor such a network setup. To this end we present a novel analytical framework\nthat accommodates for the non-convexity of the domain and explicitly considers\nthe effects of non-LOS nodes through reflections from the domain boundaries. We\nobtain analytical expressions in 2D and 3D which are confirmed numerically for\nRician channel fading statistics and discuss possible extensions and\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 11:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-29"}

We use well-established linear\nmethods for the decomposition, namely principal component analysis, independent\ncomponent analysis and non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF). Applying these\nmethods to a simulated dataset consisting of a variable multicolour disc black\nbody and a cutoff power law, we find that NMF outperforms the other two methods\nin distinguishing the spectral components. In addition, due the non-negative\nnature of NMF, the resulting components may be fitted separately, revealing the\nevolution of individual parameters. To test the NMF method on a real source, we\nanalyse data from the low-mass X-ray binary GX 339-4 and found the results to\nmatch those of previous studies. In addition, we found the inner radius of the\naccretion disc to be located at the innermost stable circular orbit in the\nintermediate state right after the outburst peak. This study shows that using\nunsupervised spectral decomposition methods results in detecting the separate\ncomponent fluxes down to low flux levels.

Besides the analytical study of THz\ngeneration using a local current model, we perform comprehensive 3D simulations\naccounting for propagation effects which confirm this prediction. Our results\nshow that THz conversion via tunnel ionization can be greatly improved with\nwell-designed multicolor pulses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 13:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-15"}

A theoretical explanation of the\ndynamics associated with this process has remained one of the major unsolved\nproblems in condensed matter physics. The Random First Order Transition (RFOT)\ntheory, which was proposed over twenty five years ago, provides a theoretical\nbasis for explaining much of the phenomena associated with glass forming\nmaterials. It links or relates multiple metastable states, slow or glassy\ndynamics, dynamic heterogeneity, and both a dynamical and an ideal glass\ntransition. Remarkably, the major concepts in the RFOT theory can also be\nprofitably used to understand many spectacular phenomena in biology and\ncondensed matter physics, as we illustrate here. The presence of a large number\nof metastable states and the dynamics in such complex landscapes in biological\nsystems from molecular to cellular scale and beyond leads to behavior, which is\namenable to descriptions based on the RFOT theory. Somewhat surprisingly even\nintratumor heterogeneity arising from variations in cancer metastasis in\ndifferent cells is hauntingly similar to glassy systems. There are also deep\nconnections between glass physics and electronically disordered systems\nundergoing a metal-insulator transition, aging effects in which quantum effects\nplay a role, and the physics of super glasses (a phase that is simultaneously a\nsuper fluid and a frozen amorphous structure). We argue that the common aspect\nin all these diverse phenomena is that multiple symmetry unrelated states\ngoverning both the equilibrium and dynamical behavior - a lynchpin in the RFOT\ntheory - controls the behavior observed in these unrelated systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 16:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-17"}

Material interfaces\nare ubiquity in nature and man-made devices, and often give rise to\ndiscontinuous coefficients in the governing elasticity equations. In this work,\nthe matched interface and boundary (MIB) method is developed to address\nelasticity interface problems. Linear elasticity theory for both isotropic\nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous media is employed. In our approach,\nLam$\\acute{e}$'s parameters can have jumps across the interface and are allowed\nto be position dependent in modeling isotropic inhomogeneous material. Both\nstrong discontinuity, i.e., discontinuous solution, and weak discontinuity,\nnamely, discontinuous derivatives of the solution, are considered in the\npresent study. In the proposed method, fictitious values are utilized so that\nthe standard central finite different schemes can be employed regardless of the\ninterface. Interface jump conditions are enforced on the interface, which in\nturn, accurately determines fictitious values. We design new MIB schemes to\naccount for complex interface geometries. In particular, the cross derivatives\nin the elasticity equations are difficult to handle for complex interface\ngeometries. We propose secondary fictitious values and construct geometry based\ninterpolation schemes to overcome this difficulty. Numerous analytical examples\nare used to validate the accuracy, convergence and robustness of the present\nMIB method for elasticity interface problems with both small and large\ncurvatures, strong and weak discontinuities, and constant and variable\ncoefficients.

The fact that baryons move distances comparable to dark matter\nallows us to infer that baryons at large distances can be described in a\nsimilar formalism: the backreaction of short-distance non-linearities and of\nstar-formation physics at long distances can be encapsulated in an effective\nstress tensor, characterized by a few parameters.

One factor that contributes to high energy consumption is that all\nparts of the program are considered equally significant for the accuracy of the\nend-result. However, in many cases, parts of computations can be performed in\nan approximate way, or even dropped, without affecting the quality of the final\noutput to a significant degree.\n  In this paper, we introduce a task-based programming model and runtime system\nthat exploit this observation to trade off the quality of program outputs for\nincreased energy-efficiency. This is done in a structured and flexible way,\nallowing for easy exploitation of different execution points in the\nquality/energy space, without code modifications and without adversely\naffecting application performance. The programmer specifies the significance of\ntasks, and optionally provides approximations for them. Moreover, she provides\nhints to the runtime on the percentage of tasks that should be executed\naccurately in order to reach the target quality of results. The runtime system\ncan apply a number of different policies to decide whether it will execute each\nindividual less-significant task in its accurate form, or in its approximate\nversion. Policies differ in terms of their runtime overhead but also the degree\nto which they manage to execute tasks according to the programmer's\nspecification.\n  The results from experiments performed on top of an Intel-based\nmulticore/multiprocessor platform show that, depending on the runtime policy\nused, our system can achieve an energy reduction of up to 83% compared with a\nfully accurate execution and up to 35% compared with an approximate version\nemploying loop perforation. At the same time, our approach always results in\ngraceful quality degradation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 17:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-17"}

The proposed DMD algorithm employs a locally designed Bregman\ndistance function at each agent, and thus can be viewed as a generalization of\nthe well-known Distributed Projected Subgradient (DPS) methods, which use\nidentical Euclidean distances at the agents. At each iteration of the DMD, each\nagent optimizes its own objective adjusted with the Bregman distance function\nwhile exchanging state information with its neighbors.

A key factor to design a DSA\nnetwork is the spectrum sensing algorithms for multiple channels with multiple\nusers. Multi-user cooperative channel sensing reduces the sensing time, and\nthus it increases transmission throughput. However, in a multi-channel system,\nthe problem becomes more complex since the benefits of assigning users to sense\nchannels in parallel must also be considered. A sensing schedule, indicating to\neach user the channel that it should sense at different sensing moments, must\nbe thus created to optimize system performance. In this paper, we formulate the\ngeneral sensing scheduling optimization problem and then propose several\nsensing strategies to schedule the users according to network parameters with\nhomogeneous sensors. Later on we extend the results to heterogeneous sensors\nand propose a robust scheduling design when we have traffic and channel\nuncertainty. We propose three sensing strategies, and, within each one of them,\nseveral solutions, striking a balance between throughput performance and\ncomputational complexity, are proposed. In addition, we show that a sequential\nchannel sensing strategy is the one to be preferred when the sensing time is\nsmall, the number of channels is large, and the number of users is small. For\nall the other cases, a parallel channel sensing strategy is recommended in\nterms of throughput performance. We also show that a proposed hybrid\nsequential-parallel channel sensing strategy achieves the best performance in\nall scenarios at the cost of extra memory and computation complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 22:05:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 19:12:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 May 2015 20:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-21"}

The basic idea of ABC is to empirically\napproximate the model likelihood by using intensive realizations of model runs.\nDue to computing time limitations, ABC has thus been mainly applied to models\nthat are relatively quick to simulate. We here aim at briefly introducing the\nfield of statistical emulation of computer code outputs and to demonstrate its\npotential for ABC applications. Emulation consists in replacing the costly to\nsimulate model by another (quick to simulate) statistical model called emulator\nor meta-model. This emulator is fitted to a small number of outputs of the\noriginal model, and is subsequently used as a surrogate during the inference\nprocedure. In this contribution, we first detail the principles of model\nemulation, with a special reference to the ABC context in which the description\nof the stochasticity of model realizations is as important as the description\nof the trends linking model parameters and outputs. We then compare several\nemulation strategies in an ABC context, using as case study a stochastic\necological model of community dynamics. We finally describe a novel\nemulation-based sequential ABC algorithm which is shown to decrease computing\ntime by a factor of two on the studied example, compared to previous sequential\nABC algorithms. Routines to perform emulation-based ABC were made available\nwithin the R package EasyABC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 08:18:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-25"}
