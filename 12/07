Radio and infrared observations\nindicate that the remnant is interacting with a molecular cloud. In this paper,\nthe detection of very high energy (VHE) Gamma-ray emission coincident with this\nSNR with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) is reported. An\nintegral flux F(E>400GeV)=(6.5 +-1.1stat +-1.3syst) x 10^{-13} ph/cm/s\ncorresponding to 0.7% of that of the Crab Nebula and to a luminosity of 10^34\nerg/s above the same energy threshold, and a steep photon index Gamma_VHE = 2.8\n+-0.27stat +-0.20syst are measured. The analysis of more than 5 yr of Fermi-LAT\ndata towards this source shows a power-law like spectrum with a best-fit photon\nindex Gamma_HE = 2.2 +-0.04stat +0.13-0.31syst. The combined Gamma-ray spectrum\nof G349.7+0.2 can be described by either a broken power-law (BPL) or a\npower-law with exponential (or sub-exponential) cutoff (PLC). In the former\ncase, the photon break energy is found at E_br,gamma = 55 +70-30 GeV, slightly\nhigher than what is usually observed in the HE/VHE Gamma-ray emitting\nmiddle-aged SNRs known to be interacting with molecular clouds. In the latter\ncase, the exponential (respectively sub-exponential) cutoff energy is measured\nat E_cut,gamma = 1.4 +1.6-0.55 (respectively 0.35 +0.75-0.21) TeV. A pion-decay\nprocess resulting from the interaction of the accelerated protons and nuclei\nwith the dense surrounding medium is clearly the preferred scenario to explain\nthe Gamma-ray emission. The BPL with a spectral steepening of 0.5-1 and the PLC\nprovide equally good fits to the data.

The slip source\nvector is the ratio of the curl of the non ideal electric field in the\nGeneralized Ohm's Law and the magnetic field strength. It diverges at magnetic\nnulls, unifying GMR with magnetic null-point reconnection. Only under\nrestrictive assumptions is the slip velocity related to the gradient of the\nquasi potential (integral of parallel electric field along field lines). In a\nturbulent inertial range the curl becomes extremely large while the parallel\ncomponent is tiny, so that line slippage occurs even while ideal MHD becomes\naccurate. The resolution of this paradox is that ideal MHD is valid for a\nturbulent inertial-range only in a weak sense which does not imply magnetic\nline freezing. The notion of weak solution is explained in terms of spatial\ncoarse-graining and renormalization group (RG) theory. We give an argument for\nthe weak validity of the ideal Ohm's law in the inertial range, via rigorous\nestimates of the terms in the Generalized Ohm's Law for an electron-ion plasma.\nAll of the nonideal terms (from collisional resistivity, Hall field, electron\npressure anisotropy, and electron inertia) are shown to be irrelevant in the RG\nsense and large-scale reconnection is thus governed solely by ideal dynamics.\nWe briefly discuss some implications for heliospheric reconnection, in\nparticular for deviations from the Parker spiral model of interplanetary\nmagnetic field. Solar wind observations show that reconnection in a turbulence\nbroadened heliospheric current sheet, consistent with the Lazarian-Vishniac\ntheory, leads to slip velocities that cause field lines to lag relative to the\nspiral model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Dec 2014 16:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

Indeed, E-learning systems have capacity to adapt\ncontent and learning process according to the learner profile. Adaptation\ntechniques using advanced behavioral analysis mechanisms, called \"Learner\nModeling\" or \"Profiling\". The latter require continuous tracking of the\nactivities of the learner to identify gaps and strengths in order to tailor\ncontent to their specific needs or advise and accompany him during his\napprenticeship. However, the disadvantage of these systems is that they cause\nlearners' discouragement, for learners, alone with his screen loses its\nmotivation to improve. Adding social extension to learning, to avoid isolation\nof learners and boost support and interaction between members of the learning\ncommunity, was able to increase learner's motivation. However, the tools to\nfacilitate social interactions integrated to E-learning platforms can be used\nfor purposes other than learning. These needs, which can be educational,\nprofessional or personal, create a mixture of data from the private life and\npublic life of learners. With the integration of these tools for e-learning\nsystems and the growth of the amount of personal data stored in the databases\nof these latter, protecting the privacy of students becomes a major concern.\nIndeed, the exchange of profiles between e-learning systems is done without the\npermission of their owners.

To investigate the effect of very different intrinsic\nanisotropies of sigma and pi electron bands in MgB2 on current transport, we\ngrew epitaxial films with tilted c-axis (THETA ~ 19.5{\\deg}), which enabled us\nto measure the components of Jc both along the ab-plane and the c-axis using\nmagneto-optical and transport techniques. These measurements were combined with\nscanning and transmission electron microscopy, which revealed terraced steps on\nthe surface of the c-axis tilted films. The measured field and temperature\ndependencies of the anisotropic Jc(H) show that Jc,L parallel to the terraced\nsteps is higher than Jc,T perpendicular to the terraced steps, and Jc of\nthinner films (50 nm) obtained from transport experiments at 0.1 T reaches ~10%\nof the depairing current density Jd in the ab plane, while magneto-optical\nimaging revealed much higher Jc at lower fields.

The two oscillations have a period ratio of\nP_2/P_1 = 0.612 - 0.632 that cannot be reproduced by any two radial modes.\nThus, the secondary mode is nonradial. Modes yielding similar period ratios\nhave also recently been discovered in other variables of the RRc and RRd types.\nThese objects form a homogenous group and constitute a new class of multimode\nRR Lyrae pulsators, analogous to a similar class of multimode classical\nCepheids in the Magellanic Clouds. Because a secondary mode with P_2/P_1 ~ 0.61\nis found in almost every RRc and RRd star observed from space, this form of\nmultiperiodicity must be common. In all four Kepler RRc stars studied, we find\nsubharmonics of f_2 at ~1/2 f_2 and at ~3/2 f_2. This is a signature of period\ndoubling of the secondary oscillation, and is the first detection of period\ndoubling in RRc stars.

This study\nexamined the effect of Ar bombardment on the junction of two crossed\nsingle-walled carbon nanotubes, to understand the value and limitations of this\nmethod for generating connections between nanotubes. A geometric criterion was\nused to assess the quality of the junctions formed, with the goal of\nidentifying the most productive conditions for experimental ion bombardment. In\nparticular, the effects of nanotube chirality, Ar impact kinetic energy, impact\nparticle flux and fluence, and annealing temperature were considered. The most\nproductive bombardment conditions, leading to the most crosslinking of the\ntubes with the smallest loss of graphitic (i.e. conductive) character, were\nfound to be at relatively mild impact energies (100 eV), with low flux and high\ntemperature (3000 K) annealing. Particularly noteworthy for experimental\napplication, a high junction quality is maintained for a relatively broad range\nof fluences, from 3E19 m^-2 to at least 1.0E20 m^-2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2014 01:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-09"}

Previous studies have shown that scale-free networks\nstrongly promote cooperation. However, little is known about the invasion\nmechanism of cooperation in scale-free networks. To study microscopic and\nmacroscopic behaviors of cooperators' invasion, we conducted computational\nexperiments of the evolution of cooperation in scale-free networks where,\nstarting from all defectors, cooperators can spontaneously emerge by mutation.\nSince the evolutionary dynamics are influenced by the definition of fitness, we\ntested two commonly adopted fitness functions: accumulated payoff and average\npayoff. Simulation results show that cooperation is strongly enhanced with the\naccumulated payoff fitness compared to the average payoff fitness. However, the\ndifference between the two functions decreases as the average degree increases.\nAs the average degree increases, cooperation decreases with the accumulated\npayoff fitness, while it increases with the average payoff fitness.

The intuitions and results often contrast with the\nclassic $\\ell_1$ case. For $p > 1$, we can learn and test with a number of\nsamples that is independent of the support size of the distribution: With an\n$\\ell_p$ tolerance $\\epsilon$, $O(\\max\\{ \\sqrt{1/\\epsilon^q}, 1/\\epsilon^2 \\})$\nsamples suffice for testing uniformity and $O(\\max\\{ 1/\\epsilon^q,\n1/\\epsilon^2\\})$ samples suffice for learning, where $q=p/(p-1)$ is the\nconjugate of $p$. As this parallels the intuition that $O(\\sqrt{n})$ and $O(n)$\nsamples suffice for the $\\ell_1$ case, it seems that $1/\\epsilon^q$ acts as an\nupper bound on the \"apparent\" support size.\n  For some $\\ell_p$ metrics, uniformity testing becomes easier over larger\nsupports: a 6-sided die requires fewer trials to test for fairness than a\n2-sided coin, and a card-shuffler requires fewer trials than the die. In fact,\nthis inverse dependence on support size holds if and only if $p > \\frac{4}{3}$.\nThe uniformity testing algorithm simply thresholds the number of \"collisions\"\nor \"coincidences\" and has an optimal sample complexity up to constant factors\nfor all $1 \\leq p \\leq 2$.

Unfortunately, the increase in concurrency usually comes\nat the cost of transaction serializability. If a database user requests full\nserializability, modern multi-versioned systems significantly constrain\nread-write concurrency among conflicting transactions and employ expensive\nsynchronization patterns in their design. In main-memory multi-core settings,\nthese additional constraints are so burdensome that multi-versioned systems are\noften significantly outperformed by single-version systems.\n  We propose Bohm, a new concurrency control protocol for main-memory\nmulti-versioned database systems. Bohm guarantees serializable execution while\nensuring that reads never block writes. In addition, Bohm does not require\nreads to perform any book-keeping whatsoever, thereby avoiding the overhead of\ntracking reads via contended writes to shared memory. This leads to excellent\nscalability and performance in multi-core settings. Bohm has all the above\ncharacteristics without performing validation based concurrency control.\nInstead, it is pessimistic, and is therefore not prone to excessive aborts in\nthe presence of contention. An experimental evaluation shows that Bohm performs\nwell in both high contention and low contention settings, and is able to\ndramatically outperform state-of-the-art multi-versioned systems despite\nmaintaining the full set of serializability guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2014 07:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 23:06:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2015 03:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-04"}

Water maser spectra show several components spreading over a large\nvelocity range ~75 km/s and tracing a collimated jet.

Moreover, the\nvelocity distribution of the maser emission shows a \"Hubble-like\" flow (higher\nvelocities at larger distances from the central star), consistent with a\nshort-lived, explosive mass-loss event. This velocity pattern is not seen in\nother WFs (presumably in earlier evolutionary stages).

For each round of data gathering, an EMLN-DG tree spanning the entire\nsensor network is formed based on the residual energy level available at the\nnodes and the number of uncovered neighbors of a node during tree formation.\nOnly nodes that have a relatively larger number of neighbors as well as a\nhigher energy level are included as intermediate nodes in the EMLN-DG tree. By\nmaximizing the number of leaf nodes in a DG tree and considering the energy\nlevel available at the nodes while forming the tree, we reduce energy\nconsumption per round as well as balance the energy level across all the nodes\nin the network. This contributes to a significantly larger network lifetime,\nmeasured as the number of rounds before the first node failure due to\nexhaustion of battery charge. Performance comparison studies with the\nwell-known data gathering algorithms such as LEACH and PEGASIS illustrate that\nEMLN-DG can help to sustain the network for a significantly larger number of\nrounds and at the same time incur a lower, or if not comparable, energy loss,\ndelay and energy loss*delay per round of data gathering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2014 10:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-09"}

A spectral sequence generalizing the classical computation of\nHochschild homology of a Hopf algebra to the case of arbitrary homogeneous\nquotient-coalgebra-Galois extensions is constructed. A Pontryagin type\nself-duality of the Takeuchi-Galois correspondence is combined with the cyclic\nduality of Connes in order to obtain dual results on the invariant cyclic\nhomology, with SAYD coefficients, of algebras of invariants in homogeneous\nquotient-coalgebra-Galois extensions. The relation of this dual result with the\nChern character, Frobenius reciprocity, and inertia phenomena in the local\nLanglands program, the Chen-Ruan-Brylinski-Nistor orbifold cohomology and the\nClifford theory is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2014 15:43:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 14:21:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 May 2015 18:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-02"}

We explore various aspects of deuterium\nenrichment by constructing a chemical evolution model in gas and grain phases.\nDepending on various physical parameters, gas and grains are allowed to\ninteract with each other through exchange of their chemical species. It is\nknown that HCO+ and N2H+ are two abundant gas phase ions in ISM and their\ndeuterium fractionation are generally used to predict degree of ionization in\nvarious regions of a molecular cloud. To have a more realistic estimation, we\nconsider a density profile of a collapsing cloud. We present radial\ndistributions of important interstellar molecules along with their deuterated\nisotopomers. We carry out quantum chemical simulation to study effects of\nisotopic substitution on spectral properties of these important interstellar\nspecies. We calculate vibrational (harmonic) frequency of the most important\ndeuterated species (neutral & ions). Rotational and distortional constants of\nthese molecules are also computed to predict rotational transitions of these\nspecies.

In\nparticular, the rule of ND works to select the nearest node in the descending\ndirection of potential as the parent node of each node, which is in essence\ndifferent from the classical Gradient Descent or Steepest Descent. The\nconstructed In-Tree proves a very good candidate for clustering due to its\nparticular features and properties. In the In-Tree, the original clustering\nproblem is reduced to a problem of removing a very few of undesired edges from\nthis graph. Pleasingly, the undesired edges in In-Tree are so distinguishable\nthat they can be easily determined in either automatic or interactive way,\nwhich is in stark contrast to the cases in the widely used Minimal Spanning\nTree and k-nearest-neighbor graph. The cluster number in the proposed method\ncan be easily determined based on some intermediate plots, and the cluster\nassignment for each node is easily made by quickly searching its root node in\neach sub-graph (also an In-Tree). The proposed method is extensively evaluated\non both synthetic and real-world datasets. Overall, the proposed clustering\nmethod is a density-based one, but shows significant differences and advantages\nin comparison to the traditional ones. The proposed method is simple yet\nefficient and reliable, and is applicable to various datasets with diverse\nshapes, attributes and any high dimensionality\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2014 11:38:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2018 14:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-26"}
