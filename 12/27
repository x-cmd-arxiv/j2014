Of\nthese SNe, 15 SNe Ia and 8 SNe II are new discoveries reported here for the\nfirst time. We use our SN samples to measure SN rates per unit mass as a\nfunction of galaxy stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR), and specific SFR\n(sSFR), as derived by the MPA-JHU Galspec pipeline. We show that correlations\nbetween SN Ia and SN II rates per unit mass and galaxy stellar mass, SFR, and\nsSFR can be explained by a combination of the respective SN delay-time\ndistributions (the distributions of times that elapse between the formation of\na stellar population and all ensuing SNe), the ages of the surveyed galaxies,\nthe redshifts at which they are observed, and their star-formation histories.\nThis model was first suggested by Kistler et al. for the SN Ia rate-mass\ncorrelation, but is expanded here to SNe II and to correlations with galaxy SFR\nand sSFR.

Using a new general\ncirculation model of Titan's atmosphere, we simulate its climate under four\ncharacteristic configurations of orbital parameters that correspond to\nsnapshots over the past 42 kyr, capturing the amplitude range of long-period\ncyclic variations in eccentricity and longitude of perihelion. The model, which\ncovers pressures from the surface to 0.5 mbar, reproduces the present-day\ntemperature profile and tropospheric superrotation. In all four simulations,\nthe atmosphere efficiently transports methane poleward, drying out the low- and\nmid-latitudes, indicating that these regions have been desert-like for at least\ntens of thousands of years. Though circulation patterns are not significantly\ndifferent, the amount of surface methane that builds up over either pole\nstrongly depends on the insolation distribution; in the present-day, methane\nbuilds up preferentially in the north, in agreement with observations, where\nsummer is milder but longer. The same is true, to a lesser extent, for the\nconfiguration 14 kyr ago, while the south pole gains more methane in the case\nfor 28 kyr ago, and the system is almost symmetric 42 kyr ago. This confirms\nthe hypothesis that orbital forcing influences the distribution of surface\nliquids, and that the current observed asymmetry could have been partially or\nfully reversed in the past. The evolution of the orbital forcing implies that\nthe surface reservoir is transported on timescales of $\\sim$30 kyr, in which\ncase the asymmetry reverses with a period of $\\sim$125 kyr. Otherwise, the\norbital forcing does not produce a net asymmetry over longer timescales, and is\nnot a likely mechanism for generating the observed dichotomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Dec 2014 22:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

This\nincludes the preceding works given by Cho, Faddeev and Niemi, as a special case\ncalled the maximal option in our reformulations. The advantage of our\nreformulations is that the original non-Abelian gauge field variables can be\nchanged into the new field variables such that one of them called the\nrestricted field gives the dominant contribution to quark confinement in the\ngauge-independent way. Our reformulations can be combined with the $SU(N)$\nextension of the Diakonov-Petrov version of the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for\nthe Wilson loop operator to give a gauge-invariant definition for the magnetic\nmonopole in the $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory without the scalar field.

Eventually,\ninfrastructure level performance monitoring and enhancement is also important.\nThis paper proposes a framework for allocation of resources in a cloud based\nenvironment thereby leading to an infrastructure level enhancement of\nperformance in a cloud environment. The framework is divided into four stages\nStage 1: Cloud service provider monitors the infrastructure level pattern of\nusage of resources and behavior of the cloud users.

The movement of data in cloud is very fast. Hence, it requires\nthat resources and infrastructure available at disposal must be equally\ncompetent. Infrastructure level performance in cloud involves the performance\nof servers, network and storage which act as the heart and soul for driving the\nentire cloud business. Thus a constant improvement and enhancement of\ninfrastructure level performance is an important task that needs to be taken\ninto account. This paper proposes a framework for infrastructure performance\nenhancement in a cloud based environment. The framework is broadly divided into\nfour steps: a) Infrastructure level monitoring of usage pattern and behaviour\nof the cloud end users, b) Reporting of the monitoring activities to the cloud\nservice provider c) Cloud service provider assigns priority according to our\ndecision matrix based max-min algorithm (DMMM) d) Providing services to cloud\nusers leading to infrastructure performance enhancement. Our framework is based\non decision matrix and monitoring in cloud using our proposed decision matrix\nbased max-min algorithm, which draws its inspiration from the original min-min\nalgorithm. This algorithm makes use of decision matrix to make decisions\nregarding distribution of resources among the cloud users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Dec 2014 08:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

The main idea is a\nmodification and generalization of the one used by Castillo Medina et al. who\nhave considered the DBSFs of a special type of $q$-MZVs. We generalize their\nmethod to a few other types of $q$-MZVs including the one defined by the author\nin 2003. With different approach, Takeyama has already studied this type by\n\"regularization\" and observed that there exist $\\mathbb Q$-linear relations\nwhich are not consequences of the DBSFs.

This deficiency of\nDBSFs occurs among other types, too, so we generalize the duality relations to\nall of these values and find that there are still some missing relations. This\nleads to the most general type of $q$-MZVs together with a new kind of\nrelations called $\\bf P$-$\\bf Q$ relations which are used to lower the\ndeficiencies further.

We show that the\nfictitious forces of noninertial reference frames are naturally encoded in the\nCartan connection transformed under the Galilean line group. These noninertial\nforces, which are coordinate effects, do not contribute to the Ricci tensor\nwhich describes the curvature of Newtonian spacetime. We show that only the\n$00$-component of the Ricci tensor is non-zero and equal to ($4\\pi$ times) the\nmatter density in any inertial or noninetial reference frame and that it leads\nto what may be called Newtonian ADM mass. While the Ricci field equation and\nGauss law are both fulfilled by the same physical matter density in inertial\nand linearly accelerating reference frames, there appears a discrepancy between\nthe two in rotating reference frames in that Gauss law holds for an effective\nmass density that differs from the physical matter density. This effective\ndensity has its origin in the simulated magnetic field that appears in rotating\nframes, highlighting a rather striking difference between linearly and\nrotationally accelerating reference frames. We further show that the dynamical\nequations that govern the simulated gravitational and magnetic fields have the\nsame form as Maxwell's equations, a surprising conclusion given that these\nequations are well-known to obey special relativity (and $U(1)$-gauge\nsymmetry), rather than Galilean symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Dec 2014 22:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-31"}

Fixed author order to alphabetical","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph cs.CC","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  We present two parallel repetition theorems for the entangled value of\nmulti-player, one-round free games (games where the inputs come from a product\ndistribution). Our first theorem shows that for a $k$-player free game $G$ with\nentangled value $\\mathrm{val}^*(G) = 1 - \\epsilon$, the $n$-fold repetition of\n$G$ has entangled value $\\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\\otimes n})$ at most $(1 -\n\\epsilon^{3/2})^{\\Omega(n/sk^4)}$, where $s$ is the answer length of any\nplayer. In contrast, the best known parallel repetition theorem for the\nclassical value of two-player free games is $\\mathrm{val}(G^{\\otimes n}) \\leq\n(1 - \\epsilon^2)^{\\Omega(n/s)}$, due to Barak, et al. (RANDOM 2009). This\nsuggests the possibility of a separation between the behavior of entangled and\nclassical free games under parallel repetition.\n  Our second theorem handles the broader class of free games $G$ where the\nplayers can output (possibly entangled) quantum states. For such games, the\nrepeated entangled value is upper bounded by $(1 -\n\\epsilon^2)^{\\Omega(n/sk^2)}$. We also show that the dependence of the exponent\non $k$ is necessary: we exhibit a $k$-player free game $G$ and $n \\geq 1$ such\nthat $\\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\\otimes n}) \\geq \\mathrm{val}^*(G)^{n/k}$.\n  Our analysis exploits the novel connection between communication protocols\nand quantum parallel repetition, first explored by Chailloux and Scarpa (ICALP\n2014). We demonstrate that better communication protocols yield better parallel\nrepetition theorems: our first theorem crucially uses a quantum search protocol\nby Aaronson and Ambainis, which gives a quadratic speed-up for distributed\nsearch problems. Finally, our results apply to a broader class of games than\nwere previously considered before; in particular, we obtain the first parallel\nrepetition theorem for entangled games involving more than two players, and for\ngames involving quantum outputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Dec 2014 23:55:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2015 04:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-07"}
