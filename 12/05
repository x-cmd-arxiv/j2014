Thus, the semiparametric method may be tried, which is to compute\nthe scores function for the main parameter minus its orthogonal projection on\nthe closed linear tangent space for the nuisance parameter, and then rescale\nfor Fisher consistency. In this paper, we derive such a semiparametric\ninfluence curve by nonlinear projection on the tangent balls arising in robust\nstatistics.\n  This semiparametric influence curve is then compared with the optimally\nrobust influence curve that minimizes maximum weighted mean square error of the\ncorresponding asymptotically linear estimators over infinitesimal\nneighborhoods. For Hellinger balls, the two coincide (with the classical one).\nIn the total variation model, the semiparametric IC solves the robust MSE\nproblem for a particular bias weight. In the case of contamination\nneighborhoods, the semiparametric IC is bounded only from above. Due to an\ninterchange of truncation and linear combination, the discrepancy increases\nwith the dimension.\n  While there is coincidence for Hellinger balls, at least clipping is achieved\nfor total variation and contamination neighborhoods, but the semiparametric\nmethod in general falls short to solve the minimax MSE estimation problem for\nthe gross error models.\n  The semiparametric approach is carried further to testing contaminated\nhypotheses. In the one-sided case, for testing hypotheses defined by any two\nclosed convex sets of tangents, a saddle point is furnished by projection on\nthe set of differences of these sets. For total variation and contamination\nneighborhoods, we thus recover the robust asymptotic tests based on least\nfavorable pairs. So the two approaches agree in the testing context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2014 16:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-05"}

After training, a brief cue can trigger a spatiotemporal\npattern of neural activity similar to that evoked by a learned stimulus\nsequence. Network models show that such sequence learning can occur through the\nshaping of feedforward excitatory connectivity via long term plasticity.\nPrevious models describe how event order can be learned, but they typically do\nnot explain how precise timing can be recalled. We propose a mechanism for\nlearning both the order and precise timing of event sequences. In our recurrent\nnetwork model, long term plasticity leads to the learning of the sequence,\nwhile short term facilitation enables temporally precise replay of events.\nLearned synaptic weights between populations determine the time necessary for\none population to activate another. Long term plasticity adjusts these weights\nso that the trained event times are matched during playback. While we chose\nshort term facilitation as a time-tracking process, we also demonstrate that\nother mechanisms, such as spike rate adaptation, can fulfill this role. We also\nanalyze the impact of trial-to-trial variability, showing how observational\nerrors as well as neuronal noise result in variability in learned event times.\nThe dynamics of the playback process determine how stochasticity is inherited\nin learned sequence timings.

Is the quantum state a physical element of\nreality as originally interpreted by Schrodinger?

Although these questions sound\nphilosophical and pointless, they can be made precise in the framework of what\nwe call classical theories of quantum processes, which are a reword of quantum\nphenomena in the language of classical probability theory. In 2012, Pusey,\nBarrett and Rudolph (PBR) proved, under an assumption of preparation\nindependence, a theorem supporting the original interpretation of Schrodinger\nin the classical framework. Recently, we showed that these questions are\nrelated to a practical problem in quantum communication complexity, namely,\nquantifying the minimal amount of classical communication required in the\nclassical simulation of a two-party quantum communication process. In\nparticular, we argued that the statement of the PBR theorem can be proved if\nthe classical communication cost of simulating the communication of n qubits\ngrows more than exponentially in 'n'. Our argument is based on an assumption\nthat we call probability equipartition property. This property is somehow\nweaker than the preparation independence property used in the PBR theorem, as\nthe former can be justified by the latter and the asymptotic equipartition\nproperty of independent stochastic sources. The equipartition property is a\ngeneral and natural hypothesis that can be assumed even if the preparation\nindependence hypothesis is dropped.

While some explanations of such\nnon-normal transient growth of disturbances in the Rayleigh stable limit were\navailable for magnetized accretion flows, similar instabilities in absence of\nmagnetic perturbations remained unexplained. This dichotomy was resolved in two\nrecent publications by Chattopadhyay, {\\it et al} where it was shown that such\ninstabilities, especially for non-magnetized accretion flows, were introduced\nthrough interaction of the inherent stochastic noise in the system (even a\n\\enquote{cold} accretion flow at 3000K is too \\enquote{hot} in the statistical\nparlance and is capable of inducing strong thermal modes) with the underlying\nTaylor-Couette flow profiles. Both studies, however, excluded the additional\nenergy influx (or efflux) that could result from nonzero cross-correlation of a\nnoise perturbing the velocity flow, say, with the noise that is driving the\nvorticity flow (or equivalently the magnetic field and magnetic vorticity flow\ndynamics). In this article we show that nonzero noise cross-correlations\nessentially renormalize the strength of temporal correlations. Apart from an\noverall boost in the energy rate (both for spatial and temporal correlations,\nand hence in the ensemble averaged energy spectra), this results in mutual\ncompetition in growth rates of affected variables often resulting in\nsuppression of oscillating Alfven waves at small times while leading to faster\nsaturations at relatively longer time scales. The effects are seen to be more\npronounced with magnetic field fluxes where the noise cross-correlation\nmagnifies the strength of the field concerned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2014 18:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The wall\narrangement of the discs has a complex and unexpected effect on the flow. For\nlow disc-tip velocities, the drag reduction scales linearly with the percentage\nof the actuated area, whereas for higher disc-tip velocity the drag reduction\ncan be larger than the prediction found through the linear scaling with\nactuated area. For medium disc-tip velocities, all the cases which display this\nadditional drag reduction exhibit stationary-wall regions between discs along\nthe streamwise direction. This effect is caused by the viscous boundary layer\nwhich develops over the portions of stationary wall due to the radial flow\nproduced by the discs. For the highest disc-tip velocity, the drag reduction\neven increases by halving the number of discs. The power spent to activate the\ndiscs is instead independent of the disc arrangement and scales linearly with\nthe actuated area for all disc-tip velocities. The Fukagata-Iwamoto-Kasagi\nidentity and flow visualizations are employed to provide further insight into\nthe dynamics of the streamwise-elongated structures appearing between discs.\nSufficient interaction between adjacent discs along the spanwise direction must\noccur for the structures to be created at the disc side where the wall velocity\nis directed in the opposite direction to the streamwise mean flow.

We explored two cases: cluster dispersal\nthrough planetary gravity alone over 1 Gyr, and a 1 Gyr evolution due to both\ngravity and the Yarkovsky effect. We find that the dispersal of the cluster in\neccentricity is primarily due to dynamical chaos, while the inclinations and\nlibration amplitudes are primarily changed by the Yarkovsky effect. Current\ndistribution of the cluster members orbits are indicative of an initially tight\norbital grouping that was affected by a negative acceleration (i.e. one against\nthe orbital motion) consistent with the thermal Yarkovsky effect. We conclude\nthat the cluster is a genetic family formed either in a collision or through\nmultiple rotational fissions. The cluster's age is on the order of 1 Gyr, and\nits long-term orbital evolution is likely dominated by the seasonal, rather\nthan diurnal, Yarkovsky effect.

The parameterization is performed from a\ncomparison of 3D CO5BOLD simulations with a grid of 1D envelopes with a varying\nmixing-length parameter. In many instances, the 3D simulations are restricted\nto the upper part of the convection zone. The hydrodynamical calculations\nsuggest, in those cases, that the entropy of the upflows does not change\nsignificantly from the bottom of the convection zone to regions immediately\nbelow the photosphere. We rely on this asymptotic entropy value, characteristic\nof the deep and adiabatically stratified layers, to calibrate 1D envelopes. The\ncalibration encompasses the convective hydrogen-line (DA) white dwarfs in the\neffective temperature range 6000 < Teff (K) < 15,000 and the surface gravity\nrange 7.0 < log g < 9.0. It is established that the local MLT is unable to\nreproduce simultaneously the thermodynamical, flux, and dynamical properties of\nthe 3D simulations. We therefore propose three different parameterizations for\nthese quantities. The resulting calibration can be applied to structure and\nenvelope calculations, in particular for pulsation, chemical diffusion, and\nconvective mixing studies. On the other hand, convection has no effect on the\nwhite dwarf cooling rates until there is a convective coupling with the\ndegenerate core below Teff ~ 5000 K. In this regime, the 1D structures are\ninsensitive to the MLT parameterization and converge to the mean 3D results,\nhence remain fully appropriate for age determinations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2014 19:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

It has been shown to be NP-hard by [Thomassen '89] and a\nlinear-time fixed-parameter algorithm has been obtained by [Mohar '99]. Despite\nextensive study, the approximability of the Euler genus remains wide open.\nWhile the existence of an $O(1)$-approximation is not ruled out, the currently\nbest-known upper bound is a trivial $O(n/g)$-approximation that follows from\nbounds on the Euler characteristic.\n  In this paper, we give the first non-trivial approximation algorithm for this\nproblem. Specifically, we present a polynomial-time algorithm which given a\ngraph $G$ of Euler genus $g$ outputs an embedding of $G$ into a surface of\nEuler genus $g^{O(1)}$. Combined with the above $O(n/g)$-approximation, our\nresult also implies a $O(n^{1-\\alpha})$-approximation, for some universal\nconstant $\\alpha>0$.\n  Our approximation algorithm also has implications for the design of\nalgorithms on graphs of small genus.

In\nthis paper, we introduce an anti-symmetrised extraction procedure that exposes\nthe full duality group. We illustrate this procedure for tree-level amplitudes\nin 4<=N<8 supergravity in four dimensions, as well as N=16 supergravity in\nthree dimensions. In three dimensions, as all bosonic degrees of freedom\ntransform under the E8 duality group, supersymmetry ensures that the amplitude\nvanishes in the single-soft limit of all particle species, in contrast to its\nhigher dimensional siblings.

We conclude that the\npresence of realistic galaxy morphology in simulations changes shear\ncalibration biases by $\\sim 1$ per cent for a wide range of methods.

This constraint agreed\nwith color-magnitude and spectroscopic redshift constraints (0.179 < z < 0.56),\nRecently, however, a much higher redshift was proposed for this blazar (z >\n1.2). This value was debated because if true, it would imply either that the\nrelevant absorption processes of gamma-rays are not well understood or that the\nEBL is dramatically different from what is believed today.

Using a new radiative transfer model, the HCN\nemission from a full two-dimensional disk was then modeled to study the effect\nof the non-LTE excitation, together with the line formation.

This is due to the Majorana bound state of\nthe wire leaking into the quantum dot. Here we extend this previous work by\ninvestigating the low--temperature quantum transport through an {\\it\ninteracting} quantum dot connected to source and drain leads and side--coupled\nto a topological wire. We explore the signatures of a Majorana zero--mode\nleaking into the quantum dot for a wide range of dot parameters, using a\nrecursive Green's function approach. We then study the Kondo regime using\nnumerical renormalization group calculations. We observe the interplay between\nthe Majorana mode and the Kondo effect for different dot-wire coupling\nstrengths, gate voltages and Zeeman fields. Our results show that a \"0.5\"\nconductance signature appears in the dot despite the interplay between the\nleaked Majorana mode and the Kondo effect. This robust feature persists for a\nwide range of dot parameters, even when the Kondo correlations are suppressed\nby Zeeman fields and/or gate voltages. The Kondo effect, on the other hand, is\nsuppressed by both Zeeman fields and gate voltages. We show that the zero--bias\nconductance as a function of the magnetic field follows a well--known\nuniversality curve. This can be measured experimentally, and we propose that\nthe universal conductance drop followed by a persistent conductance of\n$0.5\\,e^2/h$ is evidence of the presence of Majorana--Kondo physics.

In some cases,\nthe eruption of a filament appears to trigger a flare, while in others the\nobservations are more consistent with magnetic reconnection that produces both\nthe flare observational signatures (e.g., ribbons, plasma jets, post-flare\nloops, etc.) and later the destabilization and eruption of a filament. We study\nan event which occurred in NOAA 8471, where a flare and the activation of (at\nleast) two filaments were observed on 28 February 1999. By using imaging data\nacquired in the 1216, 1600, 171 and 195 \\AA\\ TRACE channels and by BBSO in the\ncontinnum and in H$\\alpha$, a morphological study of the event is carried out.\nUsing TRACE 1216 and 1600 \\AA\\ data, an estimate of the \"pure\" Ly$\\alpha$ power\nis obtained. The extrapolation of the magnetic field lines is done using the\nSOHO/MDI magnetograms and assuming a potential field. The potential magnetic\nfield extrapolation indicates that the field line connectivity changes after\nthe flare. The event is triggered by the destabilization of a filament located\nbetween the two polarities of a $\\delta$ spot. This destabilization involves\nthe magnetic arcades of the active region and causes the eruption of a second\nfilament, that gives rise to a CME and to plasma motions over a supergranular\ncell. We conclude that in this event the two filaments play an active and\ndecisive role, albeit in different stages of the phenomenon, in fact the\ndestabilization of one filament causes brightenings, reconnection and ribbons,\nwhile the second one, whose eruption is caused by the field reconfiguration\nresulting from the previous reconnection, undergoes the greatest changes and\ncauses the CME.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2014 22:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-08"}

The time complexity\nof the algorithm is also O(m+nlogn) in the worst case, where m is the number of\nedges and n is the number of nodes. However, the bound can be linear in some\ncase, for example, when edge weights of a graph are all the same and the hop\ncount of the longest shortest path is much less than n.Based on the theoretical\nanalyses, we demonstrate that the algorithm is faster than Dijkstra's algorithm\nusing Fibonacci heap in average situation when n is large enough.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 01:04:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 01:34:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 14:52:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 01:21:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 12:24:42 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 10:29:33 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 08:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2015 11:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-16"}

In the first problem, we consider the construction of a\nwavefunction as a problem of interpolation, with information content in a\nmultipoint perspective at finitely many discrete points and complete\nuncertainty elsewhere. The wavefunction is conceived abstractly as our unified\nsubjective picture of information content. Each point of information is\nessentially free and independent of all others. This is a wavefunction for a\nclassical system at the mesoscopic threshold. In the second problem, we\nconsider how, using the concept of scaling and renormalization, the classical\nsystem can be brought to represent a mesoscopic level of integrated\ninformation, with points still treated as free, but now with the need to\nconsider each point as an extended region, with possible boundary overlaps. We\nthen, in the section on the third problem, consider modeling this renormalized\nsystem as an Ising-like system of interacting spins.

However, such valuable information is often hidden when\ncomputing similarities of pedestrian images with existing approaches. Inspired\nby our user study result of human perception on human saliency, we propose a\nnovel perspective for person re-identification based on learning human saliency\nand matching saliency distribution. The proposed saliency learning and matching\nframework consists of four steps: (1) To handle misalignment caused by drastic\nviewpoint change and pose variations, we apply adjacency constrained patch\nmatching to build dense correspondence between image pairs. (2) We propose two\nalternative methods, i.e. K-Nearest Neighbors and One-class SVM, to estimate a\nsaliency score for each image patch, through which distinctive features stand\nout without using identity labels in the training procedure. (3) saliency\nmatching is proposed based on patch matching. Matching patches with\ninconsistent saliency brings penalty, and images of the same identity are\nrecognized by minimizing the saliency matching cost. (4) Furthermore, saliency\nmatching is tightly integrated with patch matching in a unified structural\nRankSVM learning framework. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on\nthe VIPeR dataset and the CUHK01 dataset. Our approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art person re-identification methods on both datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 07:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-08"}

To deal with such complexities many\nhave come up with solutions which heavily rely on expensive floating point\noperations. In this paper I used a data structure called Octree which is\nimplemented only using binary operations. Traditionally octrees were used for\ncolor quantization but here in this paper I used it as a data structure to\nstore the most frequently occuring colors in a video as well. For each of the\nstarting few video frames, I constructed a Octree using all the colors of that\nframe. Next I pruned all the trees by removing nodes below a certain height and\ngave the leaf nodes a color which is dependant on the topological path from\nthat node to its parent. Hence any two leaf nodes in two different octrees with\nthe same topological path from themselves to the root will represent the same\ncolor. Next I merged all these individual trees into a single tree retaining\nonly those nodes whose topological path to itself from the root is most common\namong all the trees. The colors represented by the leaf nodes in the resultant\ntree will be the most frequently occuring colors in the starting video frames\nof the video. Hence any color of an incomming frame that is not close to any of\nthe colors represented by the leaf node of the merged tree can be regarded as\nbelonging to a foreground object.\n  As an Octree is constructed using only binary operations, it is very fast\ncompared to other leading algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 10:44:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 01:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-13"}

However since the required number of local centers is very high,\nrunning the clustering algorithm on the entire dataset to obtain these\nrepresentational points is very time consuming. To remedy this problem, in this\npaper we are proposing two subclustering schemes where by we subdivide the\ndataset into smaller sets and run the clustering algorithm on the smaller\ndatasets to obtain the required number of datapoints to run our clustering\nalgorithm with. As we are subdividing the given dataset, we could run\nclustering algorithm on each smaller piece of the dataset in parallel. We found\nthat both parallel and serial execution of this method to be much faster than\nthe original clustering algorithm and error in running the clustering algorithm\non a reduced set to be very less.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 10:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-08"}

Yet, both, the mass-loss process and the gas chemical\ncomposition remain poorly understood. We present maps of the extended 12CO and\n13CO emission in IRC+10216, the envelope of CW Leo, the high mass loss star the\nclosest to the Sun. IRC+10216 is nearly spherical and expands radially with a\nvelocity of 14.5 km/s. The observations, made with the IRAM 30-m telescope,\nhave a sensibility, calibration, and angular resolution far higher than\nprevious studies. The angular resolution is 11\", which corresponds to an\nexpansion time of 500 yr. The CO emission consists of a centrally peaked\npedestal and a series of bright, nearly spherical shells. It peaks on CW Leo\nand remains relatively strong up to 180\". Further out it becomes very weak and\nvanishes as CO gets photodissociated. The CO maps allow to trace the mass loss\nhistory in the last 8000 yr. The bright CO shells denote overdense regions,\nwhich indicate that the mass loss process is highly variable on timescales of\nhundreds of years. The new data, however, infirm previous claims of a strong\ndecrease of the average mass loss in the last few thousand years. The overdense\nshells are not perfectly concentric and extend farther to the N-NW. The typical\nshell separation is 800-1000 yr in the middle of the envelope, but seems to\nincrease outwards. The shell-intershell brightness contrast is $\\geq$ 3. All\nthose key features can be accounted for if CW Leo has a companion star with a\nperiod of $\\sim$ 800 yr that increases the mass loss rate when it comes close\nto periastron. Higher angular resolution observations are needed to fully\nresolve the dense shells and measure the density contrast. The latter plays an\nessential role for our understanding of the envelope chemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 10:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 12:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

This class of decoders both approximates the optimal decoder of\nForney, and also includes the following simplified subclasses of decoding\nrules: The first is a function of the output vector only, but not the codebook\n(which is most suitable for high rates), and the second is a scaled version of\nthe maximum likelihood decoder (which is most suitable for low rates). We\nprovide single-letter expressions for the exact random coding exponents of any\ndecoder in these classes, operating over a discrete memoryless channel. For\neach class of decoders, we find the optimal decoder within the class, in the\nsense that it maximizes the erasure/list exponent, under a given constraint on\nthe error exponent. We establish the optimality of the simplified decoders of\nthe first and second kind for low and high rates, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 11:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

By averaging over an ensemble of\nevents generated with the UrQMD transport model, we extract the local\nthermodynamic properties at each time step of the calculation. With an equation\nof state the temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}$ can be\ndetermined. The approach goes beyond simplified fireball models of the\nbulk-medium evolution by treating the full (3+1)-dimensional expansion of the\nsystem with realistic time and density profiles. For the calculation of thermal\ndilepton rates we use the in-medium spectral function of the $\\rho$ meson\ndeveloped by Rapp and Wambach and consider thermal QGP and multi-pion\ncontributions as well. The approach is applied to the evaluation of dimuon\nproduction in In+In collisions at top SPS energy. Comparison to the\nexperimental results of the NA60 experiment shows good agreement of this\nansatz. We find that the experimentally observed low-mass dilepton excess in\nthe mass region from 0.2 to 0.6 GeV can be explained by a broadening of the\n$\\rho$ spectral function with a small mass shift. In contrast, the intermediate\nmass region ($M > 1.5$ GeV) is dominated by a contribution from the quark-gluon\nplasma. These findings agree with previous calculations with fireball\nparametrizations. This agreement in spite of differences in the reaction\ndynamics between both approaches indicates that the time-integrated dilepton\nspectra are not very sensitive to details of the space-time evolution of the\ncollision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 11:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2015 14:58:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 10:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The comet also experienced several close\nencounters with Jupiter especially in 1959 and 1923 (less than 1 AU). These\nperturbations cause the chaoticity of the comet orbit at short time scale. The\ngoal of this paper is to have a precise idea of the comet recent dynamical\nhistory. This is done in studying the mean trends of the comet orbital elements\nand also in characterizing its chaotic motion with the Fast Lyapunov indicator.\nTo compute these mean trends, two sets (considering or not the\nnon-gravitational forces) of 1000 clone orbits of the comet were considered.\nThis paper shows that the last close encounter with Jupiter on February\n$4^{\\text{th}}$, 1959 drastically modified the orbital elements of the comet\n(especially the perihelion distance from more than 2.7 AU prior the encounter\nto 1.3 AU after the encounter).

For the first time, the\nevolution of an asymmetric eruptive filament is analysed in simultaneous SUMER\nspectroscopic and TRACE and EIT imaging data. We use imaging observations from\nEIT and TRACE in the 195A channel and spectroscopic observations from the CDS\nin a rastering and SUMER in a sit-and-stare observing mode. The SUMER spectra\ncover spectral lines with formation temperatures from logT(K) ~ 4.0 to 6.1.\nAlthough the event was already analysed in two previous studies, our analysis\nbrings a wealth of new information on the dynamics and physical properties of\nthe observed phenomena. We found that the dynamic event is related to a complex\nflare with two distinct impulsive peaks, one according to the GOES\nclassification as C1.1 and the second - C1.9. The first energy release triggers\na fast-mode wave and a CME with a clear CME driven compression ahead of it.\nThis activity is related to, or possibly caused, by an asymmetric filament\neruption. The filament is observed to rise with its leading edge moving at a\nspeed of ~300 km/s detected both in the SUMER and CDS data. The rest of the\nfilament body moves at only ~150 km/s while untwisting. No signature is found\nof the fast-mode wave in the SUMER data, suggesting that the plasma disturbed\nby the wave had temperatures above 600 000 K. The erupting filament material is\nfound to emit only in spectral lines at transition region temperatures.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the previously discovered\ndiscontinuity of the periodicity of the GeV $\\gamma$-ray emission of the\nradio-loud X-ray binary LS I +61{\\deg}303 and to determine its physical origin.\nMethods. We used wavelet analysis to explore the temporal development of\nperiodic signals. The wavelet analysis was first applied to the whole data set\nof available Fermi-LAT data and then to the two subsets of orbital phase\nintervals $\\Phi = 0.0 - 0.5$ and $\\Phi = 0.5 - 1.0$. We also performed a\nLomb-Scargle timing Analysis. We investigated the similarities between GeV\n$\\gamma$-ray emission and radio emission by comparing the folded curves of the\nFermi-LAT data and the Green Bank Interferometer radio data. Results. During\nthe epochs when the timing analysis fails to determine the orbital periodicity,\nthe periodicity is present in the two orbital phase intervals $\\Phi = 0.0 -\n0.5$ and $\\Phi = 0.5 - 1.0$. That is, there are two periodical signals, one\ntowards periastron (i.e., $\\Phi = 0.0 - 0.5$) and another one towards apoastron\n($\\Phi = 0.5 - 1.0$).

The experimental data of the transverse momentum spectra and the\nrapidity distributions are well reproduced. This is done by using a statistical\nthermal freeze-out model which incorporates the rapidity (collision) axis as\nwell as transverse direction boosts developed within an expanding hot and dense\nhadronic fluid (fireball) till the final freeze-out. We determine the\nthermo-chemical freeze-out conditions particularly in terms of temperature,\nbaryon chemical potential and collective flow effect parameters for different\nparticle species. The parameters indicate occurrence of freeze-out of the\nsingly and doubly strange hyperon species at somewhat earlier times during the\nevolution of the fireball. Dependence of the freeze-out parameters on the\ndegree of centrality is also described and it is found that the kinetic\ntemperature increases and collective flow effect decreases with decreasing\ncentrality at all energies studied. The nuclear transparency effect is also\nstudied and it is clear from our model that the nuclear matter becomes more\ntransparent at the highest RHIC energy compared to lower RHIC energies.

Their\nfundamental inconsistencies render a consistent theory of quantum gravity the\nmost challenging problem in physics. Here we propose an information-complete\nquantum field theory (ICQFT), which describes elementary fermions, their gauge\nfields, and gravity (together, called the trinary fields) as an elementary\ntrinity without any conceptual inconsistency of existing theories. We then\nargue that the ICQFT provides a coherent picture and conceptual framework of\nunifying matter and spacetime (gravity) as information via spacetime-matter\nentanglement and gives a compelling solution to the problem of time and time's\narrow. The trinary fields are characterized by dual entanglement and dual\ndynamics. Spacetime-matter entanglement encodes complete physical predictions\nof the theory and allows us to give a quantum information definition of dark\nenergy. We consider two particular forms of spacetime-matter entangled states\nand their physical consequences. One of them\\ is consistent with the\nvariational holographic relation and another results in an universal relation\nbetween entanglement entropy and geometry (area and volume). This latter\nrelation allows us to determine the cosmological constant term in the classical\nEinstein equation and implies that our Universe is not strictly holographic due\nto dark energy (related to an universal negative pressure). We predict the\ninterior quantum state of a Schwarzschild black hole to be maximally\ninformation-complete. As a concrete quantum formulation of gravity coupled with\nmatter, the ICQFT is about quantum information dynamics for spacetime and\nmatter and eliminates the conceptual obstacles of existing quantum gravity\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 13:29:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2015 07:55:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 15:46:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2015 17:27:09 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 14:11:22 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 1 Jan 2019 17:22:28 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2019 15:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-04"}

The\nnature of the observed jets in relation to the bulk flow is still unclear. In\nparticular it is not clear whether the observations of parsec-scale jets using\nthe very long baseline interferometric technique (VLBI) reveal wave-like\nstructures that develop and propagate along the jet, or trace the jet flow\nitself. In this contribution I review the evidence collected during the last\nyears showing that the ridge-lines of helical radio-jets do not correspond to\nobservational artifacts. This conclusion was reached by studying a number of\nVLBI observations of the radio jet in the quasar S5~0836+710 at different\nfrequencies and epochs. The ridge-line of the emission in the jet coincides at\nall frequencies within the errors. Moreover, small differences between the\nridge-lines as observed at different epochs reveal wave-like motion transversal\nto the jet propagation axis. I also discuss similar results, albeit with\ndifferent interpretations, obtained by other authors. The current challenge is\nto measure the propagation velocities of these waves and to try to characterise\nthem in terms of simple perturbations or Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, which\nwould help understanding the physical conditions of the flow where the waves\ndevelop. This problem can only be tackled by high-resolution observations such\nas those that can be achieved by the space radio-antenna Radioastron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 10:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-13"}
