In over-damped soft matter systems, such behavior is\na hallmark of the presence of a sustained external driving force accompanied\nwith dissipations. In an under-damped and strongly correlated system, however,\ncyclic motions are often the consequences of a conservative dynamics. In the\npresent paper, we give a novel interpretation of a class of diffusion processes\nwith stationary circulation in terms of a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium in\nwhich cyclic motions are on the level set of stationary probability density\nfunction thus non-dissipative, e.g., a supercurrent. This implies an\northogonality between stationary circulation $J^{ss}(x)$ and the gradient of\nstationary probability density $f^{ss}(x)>0$.

This triggered\nthe need for more efficient methods than general purpose compression tools,\nsuch as the widely used gzip. Most reference-free tools developed for NGS data\ncompression still use general text compression methods and fail to benefit from\nalgorithms already designed specifically for the analysis of NGS data. The goal\nof our new method Leon is to achieve compression of DNA sequences of high\nthroughput sequencing data, without the need of a reference genome, with\ntechniques derived from existing assembly principles, that possibly better\nexploit NGS data redundancy. Results: We propose a novel method, implemented in\nthe software Leon, for compression of DNA sequences issued from high throughput\nsequencing technologies. This is a lossless method that does not need a\nreference genome. Instead, a reference is built de novo from the set of reads\nas a probabilistic de Bruijn Graph, stored in a Bloom filter. Each read is\nencoded as a path in this graph, storing only an anchoring kmer and a list of\nbifurcations indicating which path to follow in the graph. This new method will\nallow to have compressed read files that also already contain its underlying de\nBruijn Graph, thus directly re-usable by many tools relying on this structure.\nLeon achieved encoding of a C. elegans reads set with 0.7 bits/base,\noutperforming state of the art reference-free methods.

The lack of detectable pulses represents a big open\nproblem for two important reasons. The first is that the structure of the\naccretion flow in the region closest to the neutron star is not well understood\nand it is therefore unclear what is the mechanism that prevents the pulse\nformation. The second is that the detection of pulsations would immediately\nreveal the spin of the neutron star. Aql X-1 is a special source among low mass\nX-ray binaries because it has showed the unique property of pulsating for only\n~150 seconds out of a total observing time of more than 1.5 million seconds.\nHowever, the existing upper limits on the pulsed fraction leave open two\nalternatives. Either Aql X-1 has very weak pulses which have been undetected,\nor it has genuinely pulsed only for a tiny amount of the observed time.\nUnderstanding which of the two scenarios is the correct one is fundamental to\nincrease our knowledge about the pulse formation process and understand the\nchances we have to detect weak pulses in other LMXBs. In this paper we perform\na semi-coherent search on the entire X-ray data available for Aql X-1.

Moreover, more relaxed clusters could host diffuse \"off state\"\nhalos produced by secondary electrons.

The\ninteraction between kinetochores and microtubules is highly dynamic with\nfrequent attachments and detachments. However, it remains unclear how\nchromosome bi-orientation is achieved with such accuracy in such a dynamic\nprocess.\n  Results: To gain new insight into this essential process, we have developed a\nsimple mathematical model of kinetochore-microtubule interactions during cell\ndivision in general, i.e. both mitosis and meiosis. Firstly, the model reveals\nthat the balance between attachment and detachment probabilities of kMTs is\ncrucial for correct chromosome bi-orientation. With the right balance,\nincorrect attachments are resolved spontaneously into correct bi-oriented\nconformations while an imbalance leads to persistent errors. In addition, the\nmodel explains why errors are more commonly found in the first meiotic division\n(meiosis I) than in mitosis and how a faulty conformation can evade the spindle\nassembly checkpoint, which may lead to a chromosome loss.\n  Conclusions: The proposed model, despite its simplicity, helps us understand\none of the primary causes of chromosomal instability - aberrant\nkinetochore-microtubule interactions. The model reveals that chromosome\nbi-orientation is a probabilistic self-organization, rather than a\nsophisticated process of error detection and correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 17:23:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 16:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

However, the electron mobility of mono- and\nfew-layer MoS2 has so far been substantially below theoretically predicted\nlimits, particularly at low temperature (T), which has hampered efforts to\nobserve its intrinsic quantum transport behaviors. Potential sources of\ndisorder and scattering include both defects such as sulfur vacancies in the\nMoS2 itself, and extrinsic sources such as charged impurities and remote\noptical phonons from oxide dielectrics. To reduce extrinsic scattering and\napproach the intrinsic limit, we developed a van der Waals (vdW)\nheterostructure device platform where MoS2 layers are fully encapsulated within\nhexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and electrically contacted in a multi-terminal\ngeometry using gate-tunable graphene electrodes. Multi-terminal\nmagneto-transport measurements show dramatic improvements in performance,\nincluding a record-high Hall mobility reaching 34,000 cm2/Vs for 6-layer MoS2\nat low T.

We present a direct measurement of the cut-off energy in\nthe nuclear continuum of the nearby Seyfert 1.9 galaxy MCG -05-23-016 with\nunprecedented precision. The high sensitivity of NuSTAR up to 79 keV allows us\nto clearly disentangle the spectral curvature of the primary continuum from\nthat of its reflection component. Using a simple phenomenological model for the\nhard X-ray spectrum, we constrain the cut-off energy to $116_{-5}^{+6}$ keV\nwith 90% confidence. Testing for more complex models and nuisance parameters\nthat could potentially influence the measurement, we find that the cut-off is\ndetected robustly. We further use simple Comptonized plasma models to provide\nindependent constraints for both the kinetic temperature of the electrons in\nthe corona and its optical depth. At the 90% confidence level, we find\n$kT_e=29\\pm2$ keV and $\\tau_e=1.23\\pm0.08$ assuming a slab (disk-like)\ngeometry, and $kT_e=25\\pm2$ keV and $\\tau_e=3.5\\pm0.2$ assuming a spherical\ngeometry.

With the optical\ndepth in the optically thick regime, the data are pushing the currently\navailable theoretical models of the Comptonized plasma to the limits of their\nvalidity. Since the spectral features and variability arising from the inner\naccretion disk have been observed previously in MCG -05-23-016, the inferred\nhigh optical depth implies that a spherical or disk-like corona cannot be\nhomogeneous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 18:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

While this is not traditional radio astronomy, it is an opportunity\nfor productive synergy between the large investment in the SKA and the even\nlarger investments in space missions to maximize the total scientific value\nreturned to society. Specific applications include short-term increases in\ndownlink data rate during critical mission phases or spacecraft emergencies,\nenabling new mission concepts based on small probes with low power and small\nantennas, high precision angular tracking via VLBI phase referencing using\nin-beam calibrators, and greater range and signal/noise ratio for bi-static\nplanetary radar observations.

However, if you simply\nalternate convolutional layers with max-pooling layers, performance is limited\ndue to the rapid reduction in spatial size, and the disjoint nature of the\npooling regions. We have formulated a fractional version of max-pooling where\nalpha is allowed to take non-integer values. Our version of max-pooling is\nstochastic as there are lots of different ways of constructing suitable pooling\nregions. We find that our form of fractional max-pooling reduces overfitting on\na variety of datasets: for instance, we improve on the state-of-the art for\nCIFAR-100 without even using dropout.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 20:45:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 11:06:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 20:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 06:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

The physical mechanism responsible for the development of these\nexponentially growing instabilities is the superradiant amplification of\nbosonic fields confined between the black hole and the mirror. A remarkable\nfeature of this composed black-hole-mirror-field system is the existence of a\ncritical mirror radius, $r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$, which supports {\\it\nstationary} (marginally-stable) field configurations. This critical\n(`stationary') mirror radius marks the boundary between stable and unstable\nblack-hole-mirror-field configurations: composed systems whose confining mirror\nis situated in the region $r_{\\text{m}}<r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$ are stable\n(that is, all modes of the confined field decay in time), whereas composed\nsystems whose confining mirror is situated in the region\n$r_{\\text{m}}>r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$ are unstable (that is, there are\nconfined field modes which grow exponentially over time).

When radial\nmigration is very efficient, a large fraction of disk stars experiences\nsignificant, permanent changes to their individual orbital angular momenta over\nthe lifetime of the disk, having strong implications for the evolution of disk\ngalaxies. The first step for a star in a spiral disk to migrate radially is to\nbe captured in a \"trapped\" orbit, associated with the corotation resonance of\nthe spiral pattern. An analytic criterion for determining whether or not a star\nis in a trapped orbit has previously been derived only for stars with zero\nrandom orbital energy in the presence of a spiral with fixed properties.

From the perspective of acoustic imaging, the time limited\nimpulse response at the boundary, or boundary Green's function, represents\nmeasured data, and the objective is to determine coefficients, which encode\nphysical parameters, from the data. The present paper resolves two fundamental\nopen problems for layered media: (1) how to compute the time limited Green's\nfunction in the presence of discontinuous coefficients; and (2) to determine\nprecisely how data depends on coefficients. We show that there exists a single\nsystem of equations in $3n$-dimensional space that governs the parameterized\nfamily of all $n$-layered media simultaneously. The alternate system has smooth\ncoefficients, can be solved directly by separation of variables, and recovers\nthe impulse response at the boundary for the original equations.

The Leggett-Garg (LG) inequality was derived to allow\nexperimental test of whether or not this doctrine is true; it is also often\nthought of as a temporal version of a Bell-inequality. Despite recent interest\nin the inequality, controversy remains regarding what would be shown by its\nviolation. Here we resolve this controversy, which arises due to an\ninsufficiently general and model-independent approach to the question so far.\nWe argue that LG's initial characterisation of MR does not pick out a\nparticularly natural realist position, so we articulate an operationally\nwell-defined and well-motivated position in its place. We show that much weaker\nconditions than LG's are sufficient to derive the inequality: in the first\ninstance, its violation only demonstrates that certain measurements fail to be\nnon-disturbing at the operational level. We articulate three distinct species\nof MR-ist position, and argue that it is only the first of these which can be\nrefuted by LG inequality violation. This first position is an attractive one,\nso ruling it out remains of interest, however. A crucial role is played in LG's\nargument by the assumption of noninvasive measurability. We show that this\nnotion is ambiguous between the weaker notion of disturbance at the operational\nlevel, and the stronger notion of invasiveness at the ontic level of properties\nof the system. Ontic noninvasiveness would be required to rule out MR per se\nbut this property is not entailed by MR, and its presence cannot be established\nin a model-independent way. It follows that despite the formal parallels,\nBell's and LG's inequalities are not methodologically on a par.

The\nbuckling instability of individual filaments is found to play a key role in\nlocalizing collapse events due to local force imbalance.

Recent synchrotron x-ray\ndiffraction experiments [W. I. David et al., J. Am. Chem.

In order to understand the atomistic\nmechanisms behind these processes, we carry out comprehensive first-principles\nstudies of native point defects and defect complexes in the two compounds. We\nfind that both LiNH$_{2}$ and Li$_{2}$NH are prone to Frenkel disorder on the\nLi sublattice. Lithium interstitials and vacancies have low formation energies\nand are highly mobile, and therefore play an important role in mass transport\nand ionic conduction. Hydrogen interstitials and vacancies, on the other hand,\nare responsible for forming and breaking N$-$H bonds, which is essential in the\nLi amide/imide reaction. Based on the structure, energetics, and migration of\nhydrogen-, lithium-, and nitrogen-related defects, we propose that LiNH$_{2}$\ndecomposes into Li$_{2}$NH and NH$_{3}$ according to two competing mechanisms\nwith different activation energies: one mechanism involves the formation of\nnative defects in the interior of the material, the other at the surface. As a\nresult, the prevailing mechanism and hence the effective activation energy for\ndecomposition depend on the surface-to-volume ratio or the specific surface\narea, which changes with particle size during ball milling.

But if the cumulative energy carried\nby the pulse exceeds certain level, the entire photonic structure reflects the\nincident light (and does not absorb it!) for a broad frequency window. The\nunderlying physical mechanism is based on self-regulated impedance mismatch\nwhich increases dramatically with the cumulative energy carried by the pulse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 04:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The\nvolume-suppression of the rate for this process [relative to 2-body decay into\nheavy Standard Model (SM) final states ($W/Z/t/H$)] may be partially\ncompensated by the simplicity of the photon final state.

Irradiating an NOP with\nexternal periodic optical pulses causes the oscillating frequency of the NOP to\nsynchronize with the external stimulus. We find that chaotic oscillation occurs\nin the NOP population when they are connected by an external time delay.\nMoreover, by evaluating the time-domain signals by statistical-test suites, we\nconfirm that the signals are sufficiently random to qualify the system as a\nrandom-number generator (RNG). This study reveals that even relatively simple\nnanodevices that interact locally with each other through optical energy\ntransfer at scales far below the wavelength of irradiating light can exhibit\ncomplex oscillatory dynamics. These findings are significant for applications\nsuch as ultrasmall RNGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 09:39:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-22"}

The measured image in a real optical instrument is usually\nrepresented by the convolution of an ideal image with a Point Spread Function\n(PSF). Additionally, the image acquisition process is also contaminated by\nother sources of noise (read-out, photon-counting). The problem of estimating\nboth the PSF and a denoised image is called blind deconvolution and is\nill-posed.\n  Aims: We propose a blind deconvolution scheme that relies on image\nregularization. Contrarily to most methods presented in the literature, our\nmethod does not assume a parametric model of the PSF and can thus be applied to\nany telescope.\n  Methods: Our scheme uses a wavelet analysis prior model on the image and weak\nassumptions on the PSF. We use observations from a celestial transit, where the\nocculting body can be assumed to be a black disk. These constraints allow us to\nretain meaningful solutions for the filter and the image, eliminating trivial,\ntranslated and interchanged solutions. Under an additive Gaussian noise\nassumption, they also enforce noise canceling and avoid reconstruction\nartifacts by promoting the whiteness of the residual between the blurred\nobservations and the cleaned data.\n  Results: Our method is applied to synthetic and experimental data. The PSF is\nestimated for the SECCHI/EUVI instrument using the 2007 Lunar transit, and for\nSDO/AIA using the 2012 Venus transit. Results show that the proposed\nnon-parametric blind deconvolution method is able to estimate the core of the\nPSF with a similar quality to parametric methods proposed in the literature.

In order for the radiative mass suppression to be\nreliable, it should be guaranteed that lower loop contributions are suppressed.\nBased on loop topology and the form of electroweak presentation of the\nparticles propagating in the loop, one can determine whether a lower---and\ntherefore dominant---loop contribution is possible. We present a model based on\nthese general considerations which leads to neutrino masses via a two-loop\ndiagram which we dub as \"snail-diagram\". The model has two natural candidates\nfor dark matter one of them being a neutral Dirac fermion which can satisfy the\nconditions of the thermal freeze-out scenario by annihilation to lepton pairs.\nWe comment on the possibility of explaining the GeV gamma ray excess observed\nby Fermi-LAT from the region close to the Galaxy Center. We also discuss\npossible signals at the LHC and at experiments searching for lepton flavor\nviolating rare decays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 10:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-22"}

One such\nmotif, which has been used extensively in structures such as polyhedral cages,\ntwo-dimensional arrays, and ribbons, is a bulged duplex, that is two helical\nsegments that connect at a bulge loop. We use a coarse-grained model of DNA to\ncharacterize such bulged duplexes. We find that this motif can adopt structures\nbelonging to two main classes: one where the stacking of the helices at the\ncenter of the system is preserved, the geometry is roughly straight and the\nbulge is on one side of the duplex, and the other where the stacking at the\ncenter is broken, thus allowing this junction to act as a hinge and increasing\nflexibility. Small loops favor states where stacking at the center of the\nduplex is preserved, with loop bases either flipped out or incorporated into\nthe duplex. Duplexes with longer loops show more of a tendency to unstack at\nthe bulge and adopt an open structure. The unstacking probability, however, is\nhighest for loops of intermediate lengths, when the rigidity of single-stranded\nDNA is significant and the loop resists compression. The properties of this\nbasic structural motif clearly correlate with the structural behavior of\ncertain nano-scale objects, where the enhanced flexibility associated with\nlarger bulges has been used to tune the self-assembly product as well as the\ndetailed geometry of the resulting nanostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 12:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-10"}

According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, these black\nstrings are dual to rotating thermal states of a strongly interacting field\ntheory with nonzero chemical potential that lives in a cylinder. The dynamics\nof fluctuations in the field theory can be studied from the perturbation\nequations for classical fields in a black-string spacetime. With this\nmotivation in mind, we develop here a completely gauge and tetrad invariant\nperturbation approach to deal with the gravitoelectromagnetic fluctuations of\nrotating charged black strings in the presence of sources. As usual, for any\ncharged black hole, a perturbation in the background electromagnetic field\ninduces a metric perturbation and vice versa. In spite of this coupling and the\nnon-vanishing angular momentum, we show that linearization of equations of the\nNewman-Penrose formalism leads to four separated second-order complex equations\nfor suitable combinations of the spin coefficients, the Weyl and the Maxwell\nscalars. Then, we generalize the Chandrasekhar transformation theory by the\ninclusion of sources and apply it to reduce the perturbation problem to four\ndecoupled inhomogeneous wave equations --- a pair for each sector of\nperturbations. The radial part of such wave equations can be put into\nSchrodinger-like forms after Fourier transforming them with respect to time. We\nfind that the resulting effective potentials form two pairs of supersymmetric\npartner potentials and, as a consequence, the fundamental variables of one\nperturbation sector are related to the variables of the other sector. The\nrelevance of such a symmetry in connection to the AdS/CFT correspondence is\ndiscussed, and future applications of the pertubation theory developed here are\noutlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 12:21:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2015 18:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

In Landau gauge the truncation\nof the coupled set of DSEs for the ghost and gluon propagators is improved by\nthe first full inclusion of the sunset diagram. A solution method which avoids\nall overlapping divergences is presented. In the Maximal Abelian gauge a\ntruncation is developed with respectively one infrared and one ultraviolet\nleading diagram included. A first solution of the ghost equation is presented.\nIn the second part generalizations of the Kugo-Ojima confinement scenario to\nother gauges than the linear covariant gauge are investigated. In the\ngeneralized covariant gauge no contradiction is found by using a Faddeev-Popov\nconjugation invariant assignment of the asymptotic fields. In the last section\na gauge-independent generalized criterion is developed which allows for the\nidentification of the Coulomb, Higgs- and confining phases of Yang-Mills theory\nin terms of the infrared limit of the Dyson-Schwinger equation of the gauge\nboson propagator. While in a Coulomb phase the photon is massless, dominating\nthe infrared of the equation, in the Higgs phase this equation is dominated by\nthe physical mass of the gauge boson. In the confining phase the equation is\nsaturated by unphysical degrees of freedom in the infrared limit only.

On the other\nhand, High Performance Clusters can take advantage of Cloud Computing bursting\ntechniques for the execution of applications together with the on-premise\nresources. In order to meet deadlines, high intensive computational\napplications can use the Cloud to boost their performance when they are data\nand task parallel. This article presents an ongoing work towards the use of\nextended resources of an HPC execution platform together with Cloud. We propose\nan unified view of such heterogeneous environments and a method that monitors,\npredicts the application execution time, and dynamically shifts part of the\ndomain -- previously running in local HPC hardware -- to be computed on the\nCloud, meeting then a specific deadline. The method is exemplified along with a\nseismic application that, at runtime, adapts itself to move part of the\nprocessing to the Cloud (in a movement called bursting) and also auto-scales\n(the moved part) over cloud nodes. Our preliminary results show that there is\nan expected overhead for performing this movement and for synchronizing\nresults, but our outcomes demonstrate it is an important feature for meeting\ndeadlines in the case an on-premise cluster is overloaded or cannot provide the\ncapacity needed for a particular project.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 15:48:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 18:15:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 18:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-27"}

A cornerstone of\nthis theory is Fagin's Theorem, by which a graph property is expressible in\nexistential second-order logic (ESO logic) if, and only if, it is in NP. A\nnatural question, from the theory's point of view, is which syntactic fragments\nof ESO logic also still characterize NP. Research on this question has\nculminated in a dichotomy result by Gottlob, Kolatis, and Schwentick: for each\npossible quantifier prefix of an ESO formula, the resulting prefix class either\ncontains an NP-complete problem or is contained in P. However, the exact\ncomplexity of the prefix classes inside P remained elusive. In the present\npaper, we clear up the picture by showing that for each prefix class of ESO\nlogic, its reduction closure under first-order reductions is either FO, L, NL,\nor NP. For undirected, self-loop-free graphs two containment results are\nespecially challenging to prove: containment in L for the prefix $\\exists R_1\n\\cdots \\exists R_n \\forall x \\exists y$ and containment in FO for the prefix\n$\\exists M \\forall x \\exists y$ for monadic $M$. The complex argument by\nGottlob, Kolatis, and Schwentick concerning polynomial time needs to be\ncarefully reexamined and either combined with the logspace version of\nCourcelle's Theorem or directly improved to first-order computations.

The framework developed\nin this paper may be useful for evaluating the scalability of a wide range of\nmaterials and devices, to inform technology development in the laboratory, as\nwell as public and private research investment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 03:40:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 16:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-24"}

Those\nare actively debated questions, important for understanding of high temperature\nsuperconductivity. Here we analyze doping dependence of interlayer tunneling in\ncuprates. We observe that with decreasing doping the supercurrent is rapidly\ndecreasing, but the quasiparticle resistance at high bias remains almost\nunchanged. This indicates that Cooper pair and quasiparticle currents originate\nfrom different parts of Brillouin zone: Cooper pairs are residing only on small\npockets, which are progressively shrinking with decreasing doping, but the\nquasiparticle current is integrated over the full length of barrels, which are\nonly weakly doping dependent. The expanding pseudogap areas along the barrels\ndo not contribute to pair current. This provides direct evidence for\nnonsuperconducting origin of the pseudogap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 12:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-23"}

A proposer can offer a certain fraction of some amount of a\nvaluable good, for example, money. A responder can either accept, in which case\nthe money is shared accordingly, or reject the offer, in which case the two\nplayers receive nothing. While most authors suggest that the fairest split of\n50 % vs. 50 % would be the equilibrium solution, recently R. Suleiman (An\naspirations-homeostasis theory of interactive decisions (2014)) suggested the\nGolden Ratio, 0.618, to be the solution and argued that such a partitioning\nwould be considered fair by both sides. He provided a justification in terms of\nan approach termed aspirations-homeostasis theory. The main idea is that\nresponders tend to accept the minor fraction of the Golden Ratio because they\nfeel that this fraction equals, in comparison to the larger fraction obtained\nby the proposer, the ratio of the larger fraction and the whole amount. Here we\ngive an alternative explanation to that suggested solution, which complements\nthe reasoning by Suleiman (2014) and is based on infinite continued fractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 12:42:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

The grains are modeled by\nviscoelastic forces, Coulomb friction and resistance to rolling. Two models for\nthe rolling resistance interaction were assessed: one considers a constant\nrolling friction coefficient, and the other one a strain dependent coefficient.\nThe piles are grown on a finite size substrate and subsequently discharged\nthrough an orifice opened at the center of the substrate. Varying the orifice\nwidth and taking the final height of the pile after the discharge as the order\nparameter, one can devise a transition from a jammed regime (when the grain\nflux is always clogged by an arch) to a catastrophic regime, in which the pile\nis completely destroyed by an avalanche as large as the system size. A finite\nsize analysis shows that there is a finite orifice width associated with the\nthreshold for the unjamming transition, no matter the model used for the\nmicroscopic interactions. As expected, the value of this threshold width\nincreases when rolling resistance is considered, and it depends on the model\nused for the rolling friction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 18:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}
