The problem of supplier\nselection on which decision maker has usually vague and imprecise knowledge is\na typical example of multi criteria group decision-making problem. The\nconventional crisp techniques has not much effective for solving MCDM problems\nbecause of imprecise or fuzziness nature of the linguistic assessments. To find\nthe exact values for MCDM problems is both difficult and impossible in more\ncases in real world. So, it is more reasonable to consider the values of\nalternatives according to the criteria as single valued neutrosophic sets\n(SVNS). This paper deal with the technique for order preference by similarity\nto ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach and extend the TOPSIS method to MCDM\nproblem with single valued neutrosophic information. The value of each\nalternative and the weight of each criterion are characterized by single valued\nneutrosophic numbers. Here, the importance of criteria and alternatives is\nidentified by aggregating individual opinions of decision makers (DMs) via\nsingle valued neutrosophic weighted averaging (IFWA) operator. The proposed\nmethod is, easy use, precise and practical for solving MCDM problem with single\nvalued neutrosophic data. Finally, to show the applicability of the developed\nmethod, a numerical experiment for supplier choice is given as an application\nof single valued neutrosophic TOPSIS method at end of this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 18:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

Ratios of separated response functions in $\\pi^-$ and\n$\\pi^+$ electroproduction are particularly informative. The ratio for\ntransverse photons may allow this transition to be more easily observed, while\nthe ratio for longitudinal photons provides a crucial verification of the\nassumed pole dominance, needed for reliable extraction of the pion form factor\nfrom electroproduction data. Method: Data were acquired with 2.6-5.2 GeV\nelectron beams and the HMS+SOS spectrometers in Jefferson Lab Hall C, at\ncentral $Q^2$ values of 0.6, 1.0, 1.6 GeV$^2$ at W=1.95 GeV, and $Q^2$=2.45\nGeV$^2$ at W=2.22 GeV.

Once both regimes are combined, accurate reconstructions can be achieved\nover the full field of view. The reconstruction of a simulated lens, using\nconstraints that mimics real observations, yields accurate results in terms of\nsurface-mass density, NFW parameter, Einstein radius and magnification map\nrecovery, encouraging the application of this method to real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 21:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 11:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

How many\nqueries does a querying adversary need to submit in order to distinguish the\ntruncated permutation from the (truncated) function?\n  In 1998, Hall et al. showed an algorithm for determining (with high\nprobability) whether or not $f$ is a permutation, using $O(2^{\\frac{m+n}{2}})$\nqueries. They also showed that if $m < n/7$, a smaller number of queries will\nnot suffice. For $m > n/7$, their method gives a weaker bound. In this note, we\nfirst show how a modification of the approximation method used by Hall et al.\ncan solve the problem completely. It extends the result to practically any $m$,\nshowing that $\\Omega(2^{\\frac{m+n}{2}})$ queries are needed to get a\nnon-negligible distinguishing advantage.

The discovery of pulsed radio emission from a few magnetars\nweakened the idea of a clean separation between magnetars and normal pulsars.\nWe use the partially screened gap (PSG) model to explain radio emission of\nmagnetars. The PSG model requires that the temperature of the polar cap is\nequal to the so-called critical value, i.e., the temperature at which the\nthermal ions outflowing from the stellar surface screen the acceleration gap.\nWe show that a magnetar has to fulfill the temperature, power, and visibility\nconditions in order to emit radio waves. First, in order to form PSG, the\nresidual temperature of the surface has to be lower than the critical value.\nSecond, since the radio emission is powered by the rotational energy, it has to\nbe high enough to enable heating of the polar cap by backstreaming particles to\nthe critical temperature. Finally, the structure of the magnetic field has to\nbe altered by magnetospheric currents in order to widen a radio beam and\nincrease the probability of detection.

According to each\nelement of the codebook, we create a latent precoding matrix pair, namely a BS\nprecoding matrix and an RS precoding matrix. The RS precoding matrix is formed\nby multiplying the appropriate unitary matrix from the codebook by a power\nscaling factor.

In the proposed scheme, rather than sending the complete\nprocessing matrix, only the index of the unitary matrix and its power scaling\nfactor are sent by the BS to the RS.

In\ncontrast, the $l_p$ thresholding functions ($p \\in [0,1]$) are in closed form\nonly for $p=0,1,1/2,2/3$, known as hard, soft, half, and 2/3 thresholding\nrespectively. The TL1 threshold values differ in subcritical (supercritical)\nparameter regime where the TL1 threshold functions are continuous\n(discontinuous) similar to soft-thresholding (half-thresholding) functions. We\npropose TL1 iterative thresholding algorithms and compare them with hard and\nhalf thresholding algorithms in CS test problems. For both incoherent and\ncoherent sensing matrices, a proposed TL1 iterative thresholding algorithm with\nadaptive subcritical and supercritical thresholds consistently performs the\nbest in sparse signal recovery with and without measurement noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 01:59:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 17:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

However, as the number of component series is increased, the VAR\nmodel becomes overparameterized. Several authors have addressed this issue by\nincorporating regularized approaches, such as the lasso in VAR estimation.\nTraditional approaches address overparameterization by selecting a low lag\norder, based on the assumption of short range dependence, assuming that a\nuniversal lag order applies to all components. Such an approach constrains the\nrelationship between the components and impedes forecast performance. The\nlasso-based approaches work much better in high-dimensional situations but do\nnot incorporate the notion of lag order selection.\n  We propose a new class of hierarchical lag structures (HLag) that embed the\nnotion of lag selection into a convex regularizer.

The HLag framework offers\nthree structures, which allow for varying levels of flexibility.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to measure the\nsingle-particle diffusivities to test this hypothesis. Indeed, although the\nnon-Gaussian shape of the van-Hove distribution suggests the transient\nexistence of a diffusivity distribution, it is not possible to infer from this\nquantity whether two or more dynamical phases coexist. Here we provide the\nfirst direct observation of the dynamical coexistence of two phases with\ndifferent diffusivities, by showing that in the deeply supercooled regime the\ndistribution of the single-particle diffusivities acquires a transient bimodal\nshape.

We construct a theoretical model of diffusion that can explain the\ninward diffusion in a dipole magnetic field. The key is the identification of\nthe proper coordinates on which an appropriate diffusion operator can be\nformulated. The effective phase space is foliated by the adiabatic invariants;\non the symplectic leaf, the invariant measure (by which the entropy must be\ncalculated) is distorted, by the inhomogeneous magnetic field, with respect to\nthe conventional Lebesgue measure of the natural phase space. The collision\noperator is formulated to be consistent to the ergodic hypothesis on the\nsymplectic leaf, i.e., the resultant diffusion must diminish gradients on the\nproper coordinates. The non-orthogonality of the cotangent vectors of the\nconfiguration space causes a coupling between the perpendicular and parallel\ndiffusions, which is derived by applying Ito's formula of changing variables.\nThe model has been examined by numerical simulations. We observe the creation\nof a peaked density profile that mimics radiation belts in planetary\nmagnetospheres as well as laboratory experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 09:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-28"}

The solvability problem asks whether\nthe demands of all the destinations can be simultaneously satisfied by using\nlinear network coding. The guessing number approach converts this problem to\ndetermining the number of fixed points of coding functions $f:A^n\\to A^n$ over\na finite alphabet $A$ (usually referred to as Boolean networks if $A =\n\\{0,1\\}$) with a given interaction graph, that describes which local functions\ndepend on which variables. In this paper, we generalise the so-called reduction\nof coding functions in order to eliminate variables. We then determine the\nmaximum number of fixed points of a fully reduced coding function, whose\ninteraction graph has a loop on every vertex. Since the reduction preserves the\nnumber of fixed points, we then apply these ideas and results to obtain four\nmain results on the linear network coding solvability problem. First, we prove\nthat non-decreasing coding functions cannot solve any more instances than\nrouting already does. Second, we show that triangle-free undirected graphs are\nlinearly solvable if and only if they are solvable by routing. This is the\nfirst classification result for the linear network coding solvability problem.\nThird, we exhibit a new class of non-linearly solvable graphs. Fourth, we\ndetermine large classes of strictly linearly solvable graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 09:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-18"}

However, most mathematical and\ncomputational models ignore the details of the motor-cargo interaction. Here,\nwe study a generic model in which N motors are elastically coupled to a cargo,\nwhich itself is subjected to thermal noise in the cytoplasm and to an\nadditional external applied force. The motor-hopping rates are chosen to\nsatisfy detailed balance with respect to the energy of elastic stretching. With\nthese assumptions, an (N+1)-variable master equation is constructed for\ndynamics of the motor-cargo complex. By expanding the hopping rates to linear\norder in fluctuations in motor positions, we obtain a linear Fokker-Planck\nequation. The deterministic equations governing the average quantities are\nseparated out and explicit analytical expressions are obtained for the mean\nvelocity and diffusion coefficient of the cargo. We also study the statistical\nfeatures of the force experienced by an individual motor and quantitatively\ncharacterize the load-sharing among the cargo-bound motors. The mean cargo\nvelocity and the effective diffusion coefficient are found to be decreasing\nfunctions of the stiffness. While increase in the number of motors N does not\nincrease the velocity substantially, it decreases the effective diffusion\ncoefficient which falls as 1/N asymptotically. We further show that the\ncargo-bound motors share the force exerted on the cargo equally only in the\nlimit of vanishing elastic stiffness; as stiffness is increased, deviations\nfrom equal load sharing are observed.

The variation of electronic\nstructure due to the lateral displacement is attributed to the changing of the\ninterlayer distance dz led by atomic layer corrugation, which is in a uniform\npicture with vertical displacement.

Traditionally, a femtocell network is usually configured to be\neither completely open or completely closed in that its channels are either\nmade available to all users or used by its own users only. This may limit\nnetwork flexibility and performance. It is desirable for owners of femtocell\nbase stations if a femtocell can partially open its channels for external users\naccess. In such scenarios, spectrum and energy efficiency becomes a critical\nissue in the design of femtocell network protocols and structure. In this\npaper, we conduct performance analysis for two-tier femtocell networks with\npartially open channels. In particular, we build a Markov chain to model the\nchannel access in the femtocell network and then derive the performance metrics\nin terms of the blocking probabilities. Based on stationary state probabilities\nderived by Markov chain models, spectrum and energy efficiency are modeled and\nanalyzed under different scenarios characterized by critical parameters,\nincluding number of femtocells in a macrocell, average number of users, and\nnumber of open channels in a femtocell. Numerical and Monte-Carlo (MC)\nsimulation results indicate that the number of open channels in a femtocell has\nan adverse impact on the spectrum and energy efficiency of two-tier femtocell\nnetworks. Results in this paper provide guidelines for trading off spectrum and\nenergy efficiency of two-tier femtocell networks by configuring different\nnumbers of open channels in a femtocell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 13:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-18"}

Such systems\nmake mandatory the design of more sophisticated techniques not only for\ntransporting, storing and processing this new generation of radio\ninterferometric data, but also for restoring the astrophysical information\ncontained in such data. In this paper we present a new radio deconvolution\nalgorithm named MORESANE and its application to fully realistic simulated data\nof MeerKAT, one of the SKA precursors. This method has been designed for the\ndifficult case of restoring diffuse astronomical sources which are faint in\nbrightness, complex in morphology and possibly buried in the dirty beam's side\nlobes of bright radio sources in the field. MORESANE is a greedy algorithm\nwhich combines complementary types of sparse recovery methods in order to\nreconstruct the most appropriate sky model from observed radio visibilities. A\nsynthesis approach is used for the reconstruction of images, in which the\nsynthesis atoms representing the unknown sources are learned using analysis\npriors. We apply this new deconvolution method to fully realistic simulations\nof radio observations of a galaxy cluster and of an HII region in M31. We show\nthat MORESANE is able to efficiently reconstruct images composed from a wide\nvariety of sources from radio interferometric data. Comparisons with other\navailable algorithms, which include multi-scale CLEAN and the recently proposed\nmethods by Li et al. (2011) and Carrillo et al. (2012), indicate that MORESANE\nprovides competitive results in terms of both total flux/surface brightness\nconservation and fidelity of the reconstructed model. MORESANE seems\nparticularly well suited for the recovery of diffuse and extended sources, as\nwell as bright and compact radio sources known to be hosted in galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 13:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Additionally, I discovered a unique\ninteraction between GDP and GCEGI in both the short-run and the long-run and\nprovided policy makers with some suggestions.

This paper defines a string buffer overflow analysis\nfor C programs. The key ideas of our formulation are (a) separating buffers\nfrom the pointers that point to them, (b) modelling buffers in terms of sizes\nand sets of positions of null characters, and (c) defining stateless functions\nto compute the sets of null positions and mappings between buffers and\npointers.\n  This exercise has been carried out to test the feasibility of describing such\nan analysis in terms of lattice valued functions and relations to facilitate\nautomatic construction of an analyser without the user having to write\nC/C++/Java code. This is facilitated by devising stateless formulations because\nstateful formulations combine features through side effects in states raising a\nnatural requirement of C/C++/Java code to be written to describe them. Given\nthe above motivation, the focus of this paper is not to build good static\napproximations for buffer overflow analysis but to show how given static\napproximations could be formalized in terms of stateless formulations so that\nthey become amenable to automatic construction of analysers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 14:12:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 17:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Dec 2014 05:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 28 Dec 2014 17:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

Determining line\nparameters and optical depths and performing Large Velocity Gradient radiative\ntransfer calculations, the aims of this study are (1) to evaluate physical\nparameters of the absorbing foreground gas at z~0.89, in particular its\nhomogeneity, and (2) to monitor the spectroscopic time variability caused by\nfluctuations of the z~2.5 background continuum source. We find, that the gas is\nquite inhomogeneous with n(H2)~2 x 10^3 cm^-3 for most molecular species but\nwith higher values for H2CO and lower ones for SO. Measuring the CS J=1-0\ntransition during a time interval of more than a decade, from 2001 to 2012, the\npeak absorption depth of the line remains approximately constant, while the\nline shape undergoes notable variations. Covering the time between 1996 and\n2013, CS, HCO+, and CH3OH data indicate maximal integrated optical depths in\n~2001 and 2011/2012. This is compatible with a ~10 yr periodicity, which,\nhowever, needs confirmation by substantially longer time monitoring. Comparing\nmolecular abundances with those of different types of Galactic and nearby\nextragalactic clouds we find that the observed cloud complex does not\ncorrespond to one particular type but to a variety of cloud types with more\ndiffuse and denser components as can be expected for an observed region with a\ntransverse linear scale of several parsec and a likely larger depth along the\nline-of-sight.

A single incoming\nphoton has a non-zero probability of entering either of the two cavities. The\nJaynes-Cummings interaction in the rotating wave approximation describes the\ncoupling of each atom with the radiation field. We compute and analyze the\natom-atom entanglement, the entanglement between the two photon modes, and also\nthe entanglement between each atom and each photon mode. The measure of\nentanglement is the von Neumann entropy. For the case in which the two\natom-photon systems have identical properties, but allowing for non-resonant\nconditions, the sum of the atom-atom and photon-modes-entanglement is time\nindependent. The effect of detuning is to decrease the strength of the largest\nentanglement achieved and to shorten the time for it to occur. The results\nsupport the fact that the state of the photons after emergence from cavities is\nentangled, notwithstanding its single-particle nature.

Mapping G-code into STEP-NC should\nbenefit from more expressiveness of the manufacturing feature-based\ncharacteristics of this new standard. The work presented here proposes an\noverall method for G-code to STEP-NC conversion. First, G-code is converted\ninto canonical machining functions, this can make the method more applicable\nand make subsequent processes easier to implement; then these functions are\nparsed to generate the neutral format of STEP-NC Part21 toolpath file, this\nturns G-code into object instances, and can facilitate company's usage of\nlegacy programs; and finally, also optionally, machining features are extracted\nto generate Part21 CC2 (conformance class) file. The proposed extraction method\nemploys geometric information of cutting area inferred from toolpaths and\nmachining strategies, in addition to cutting tools' data and workpiece's\ndimension data. This comprehensive use of available data makes the extraction\nmore accurate and reliable.

The total dose radiation responses of the back transistors\nare characterized by their threshold voltage shifts. The results show that the\ntotal dose radiation response of the back transistor of SOI pMOSFETs, similar\nto that of SOI nMOSFETs, depends greatly on their bias conditions during\nirradiation. However, with the Float-State bias, rather than the Off-State\nbias, the back transistors of SOI pMOSFETs reveal a much higher sensitivity to\ntotal dose radiation, which is contrary to those of SOI nMOSFETs.
