An important question\nis whether such a critical point exists in a particular system and how stable\nit is. Here, we identify the critical point of a quantum phase transition as a\nsingular point in the affine algebraic variety of the characteristic equation\nfor the Hamiltonian describing the system, with an unstable critical point\nbeing associated with an isolated singular point which has a finite Tjurina\nnumber. The theory is illustrated by studying a model system of\nzero-dimensional (finite) Heisenberg spin chain with an impurity, which\nexhibits a nontrivial first-order quantum phase transition. Both analytical and\nnumerical calculations show that the quantum phase transition always exists\nwhen the impurity has a $Z_2$ symmetry but only remains in systems with an even\nnumber of spin sites when the $Z_2$ symmetry is broken.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 16:02:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2015 02:17:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-28"}

While erasure correcting codes\noffer a better storage efficiency than replication for similar fault tolerance,\nthey incur higher CPU consumption, higher network consumption and higher disk\nI/Os. To address these issues, codes specific to storage systems have been\ndesigned. Their main feature is the ability to repair a single lost disk\nefficiently. In this paper, we focus on one such class of codes that minimize\nnetwork consumption during repair, namely regenerating codes. We implement the\noriginal Product-Matrix Regenerating codes as well as a new optimization we\npropose and show that the resulting optimized codes allow achieving 790 MB/s\nfor encoding in typical settings.

In the particular case of $c=2$,\nwe obtain a kernel with less than $4k$ vertices and less than $8k$ edges.

After proving that the groups SL(3,R), Sp(2,R), and the universal\ncovering of Sp(2,R) have property (T*), we address the question which connected\nLie groups have the AP. A technical problem that arises when considering this\nquestion from the point of view of the AP is that the semisimple part of the\nglobal Levi decomposition of a connected Lie group need not be closed. Because\nof an important permanence property of property (T*), this problem vanishes. It\nfollows that a connected Lie group has the AP if and only if all simple factors\nin the semisimple part of its Levi decomposition have real rank 0 or 1.\nFinally, we are able to establish property (T*) for all connected simple higher\nrank Lie groups with finite center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 17:55:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 08:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

Their\nubiquity has led to their use as a standard measure of flare occurrence and\nenergy, although the overwhelming bulk of the total flare energy goes\nelsewhere. Recently Dolla et al. (2012) noted quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP)\nin the soft X-ray signature of the X-class flare SOL2011-02-15, as observed by\nthe standard photometric data from the GOES (Geostationary Operational\nEnvironmental Satellite) spacecraft. In this paper we analyze the suitability\nof the GOES data for this kind of analysis and find them to be generally\nvaluable after September, 2010 (GOES-15). We then extend the Dolla et al.\nresult to a complete list of X-class flares from Cycle 24, and show that most\nof them (80%) display QPPs in the impulsive phase. The pulsations show up\ncleanly in both channels of the GOES data, making use of time-series of\nirradiance differences (the digital time derivative on the 2-s sampling). We\ndeploy different techniques to characterize the periodicity of GOES pulsations,\nconsidering the red-noise properties of the flare signals, finding a range of\nchracteristic time scales of the QPPs for each event, but usually with no\nstrong signature of a single period dominating in the power spectrum. The QPP\nmay also appear on somewhat longer time scales during the later gradual phase,\npossibly with a greater tendency towards coherence, but the sampling noise in\nGOES difference data for large irradiance values (X-class flares) makes these\nmore uncertain. We show that there is minimal phase difference between the\ndifferenced GOES energy channels, or between them and the hard X-ray variations\non short time scales. During the impulsive phase the footpoints of the\nnewly-forming flare loops may also contribute to the observed soft X-ray\nvariations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 18:25:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2015 12:55:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 15:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

These simulators\ncan be deterministic or stochastic, fast or slow, constrained or unconstrained,\nand so on. Optimizing the simulators with respect to a set of parameter values\nis common practice, resulting in a single parameter setting that minimizes an\nobjective subject to constraints. We propose a post optimization posterior\nanalysis that computes and visualizes all the models that can generate equally\ngood or better simulation results, subject to constraints. These optimization\nposteriors are desirable for a number of reasons among which easy\ninterpretability, automatic parameter sensitivity and correlation analysis and\nposterior predictive analysis. We develop a new sampling framework based on\napproximate Bayesian computation (ABC) with one-sided kernels. In collaboration\nwith two groups of scientists we applied POPE to two important biological\nsimulators: a fast and stochastic simulator of stem-cell cycling and a slow and\ndeterministic simulator of tumor growth patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 18:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

The variational calculus used is consistent with an\ninitial value formulation of physical problems and allows for time-irreversible\nprocesses, such as dissipation, to be included at the level of the action. In\nthis formalism, the equations of motion are generated by extremizing a\nnonconservative action $\\mathcal{S}$, which is a functional of a doubled set of\ndegrees of freedom. The corresponding nonconservative Lagrangian contains a\npotential $K$ which generates nonconservative forces and interactions. Such a\nnonconservative potential can arise in several ways, including from an open\nsystem interacting with inaccessible degrees of freedom or from integrating out\nor coarse-graining a subset of variables in closed systems. We generalize\nNoether's theorem to show how Noether currents are modified and no longer\nconserved when $K$ is non-vanishing. Consequently, the nonconservative aspects\nof a physical system are derived solely from $K$. We show how to use the\nformalism with examples of nonconservative actions for discrete systems\nincluding forced damped harmonic oscillators, radiation reaction on an\naccelerated charge, and RLC circuits. We present examples for nonconservative\nclassical field theories. Our approach naturally allows for irreversible\nthermodynamic processes to be included in an unconstrained variational\nprinciple.

Approximate solutions such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and\nits Bayesian variants (BayesLSH and BayesLSHLite) alleviate the problem to some\nextent and provides substantial speedup over traditional index based\napproaches. BayesLSH is used for pruning the candidate space and computation of\napproximate similarity, whereas BayesLSHLite can only prune the candidates, but\nsimilarity needs to be computed exactly on the original data. Thus where ever\nthe explicit data representation is available and exact similarity computation\nis not too expensive, BayesLSHLite can be used to aggressively prune candidates\nand provide substantial speedup without losing too much on quality.

In previous work,\nwe showed that Tdep correlates strongly with specific star formation rate\n(sSFR). We now find that at a given sSFR, the bulge has shorter Tdep than the\ndisc. The shift to shorter depletion times is most pronounced in the inner\nbulge (R < 0.1Re). Grids from galaxies with bars and rings are similar to those\nfrom galactic bulges in that they have reduced Tdep at a given sSFR. In\ncontrast, the Tdep versus sSFR relation in the discs of galaxies with spiral\narms is displaced to longer Tdep at fixed sSFR. We then show that the\ndifferences in the Tdep-sSFR relation for bulges, discs, arms, bars and rings\ncan be linked to variations in \"stellar\", rather than gas surface density\nbetween different structures. Our best current predictor for Tdep, both\nglobally and for 1 kpc grids, is given by Tdep=\n-0.36log(Sigma_SFR)-0.5log(Sigma_*)+5.87.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 21:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 23:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

One promising way to affect structure formation on small scales is a\nrelatively strong coupling of dark matter to neutrinos. We construct an\nexperimentally viable, simple, renormalizable, model with new interactions\nbetween neutrinos and dark matter. We show that addressing the small scale\nstructure problems requires dark matter with a mass that is tens of MeV, and a\npresent-day density determined by an initial particle-antiparticle asymmetry in\nthe dark sector. Generating a sufficiently large dark matter-neutrino coupling\nrequires a new heavy neutrino with a mass around 100 MeV. The heavy neutrino is\nmostly sterile but has a substantial $\\tau$ neutrino component, while the three\nnearly massless neutrinos are partly sterile. We provide the first discussion\nof how such dark matter-neutrino interactions affect neutrino (especially\n$\\tau$ neutrino) phenomenology. This model can be tested by future\nastrophysical, particle physics, and neutrino oscillation data. A feature in\nthe neutrino energy spectrum and flavor content from a future nearby supernova\nwould provide strong evidence of neutrino-dark matter interactions.

The major challenges of road detection are dealing\nwith shadows and lighting variations and the presence of other objects in the\nscene. Current road detection algorithms characterize road areas at pixel level\nand group pixels accordingly. However, these algorithms fail in presence of\nstrong shadows and lighting variations. Therefore, we propose a road detection\nalgorithm based on video alignment. The key idea of the algorithm is to exploit\nthe similarities occurred when a vehicle follows the same trajectory more than\nonce. In this way, road areas are learned in a first ride and then, this road\nknowledge is used to infer areas depicting drivable road surfaces in subsequent\nrides. Two different experiments are conducted to validate the proposal on\ndifferent video sequences taken at different scenarios and different daytime.\nThe former aims to perform on-line road detection.

Unfortunately, CNN\nsuffers from over-fiting when it is trained on existing fine-grained image\nclassification benchmarks, which typically only consist of less than a few tens\nof thousands training images. Therefore, we first construct a large-scale\nfine-grained car recognition dataset that consists of 333 car classes with more\nthan 150 thousand training images. With this large-scale dataset, we are able\nto build a strong baseline for CNN with top-1 classification accuracy of 81.6%.\nOne major challenge in fine-grained image classification is that many classes\nare very similar to each other while having large within-class variation. One\ncontributing factor to the within-class variation is cluttered image\nbackground. However, the existing CNN training takes uniform window sampling\nover the image, acting as blind on the location of the object of interest. In\ncontrast, this paper proposes an \\emph{object-centric sampling} (OCS) scheme\nthat samples image windows based on the object location information. The\nchallenge in using the location information lies in how to design powerful\nobject detector and how to handle the imperfectness of detection results. To\nthat end, we design a saliency-aware object detection approach specific for the\nsetting of fine-grained image classification, and the uncertainty of detection\nresults are naturally handled in our OCS scheme. Our framework is demonstrated\nto be very effective, improving top-1 accuracy to 89.3% (from 81.6%) on the\nlarge-scale fine-grained car classification dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 00:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-11"}

First we revisit a simple top-down\nholographic model of QCD-like dynamics with predictions in the M_rho-M_pi\nplane. The meson masses in this model are in very good agreement with lattice\ngauge theory calculations in the quenched approximation. We show that the key\ningredient for the meson mass predictions is the running of the anomalous\ndimension of the quark condensate, gamma. This provides an explanation for the\nagreement of holographic and quenched lattice gauge theory calculations. We\nthen study the `Dynamic AdS/QCD model' in which the gauge theory dynamics is\nincluded by a choice for the running of gamma. We use the naive two-loop\nperturbative running of the gauge coupling extrapolated to the non-perturbative\nregime to estimate the running of gamma across a number of theories. We\nconsider models with quarks in the fundamental, adjoint, two-index symmetric\nand two-index anti-symmetric representations. We display predictions for M_rho,\nM_pi, M_sigma and the lightest glueball mass. Many of these theories, where the\ncontribution to the running of gamma is dominated by the gluons, give very\nsimilar spectra, which also match with lattice expectations for QCD. On the\nother hand, a significant difference between spectra in different holographic\nmodels is seen for theories where the quark content changes the gradient of the\nrunning of gamma around the scale at which chiral symmetry breaking is\ntriggered at gamma approximately 1. For these walking theories we see an\nenhancement of the rho-mass and a suppression of the sigma-mass. Both phenomena\nare characteristic for walking behaviour in the physical meson masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 00:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

The\nheliosphere extends radially out to $\\sim100$ AU from the sun, and within this\nsphere of influence, the solar wind modulates the incoming flux of galactic\ncosmic rays (CRs), especially those at low energies. Newly formed stars, which\nsupport both strong magnetic fields and winds, are expected to produce\nanalogous regions of CR exclusion, perhaps at elevated levels. Such young stars\nare encircled by molecular gas-rich disks, and the net removal of CRs from the\ncircumstellar environment significantly reduces the expected CR ionization rate\nin the disk gas, most likely by many orders-of-magnitude.

This setup is motivated by applications\nwhere transmission is sporadic and the cost of switching on the radio and\ntransmitting is significantly more important than the size of the transmitted\ndata packet. For this model, we characterize the distortion-transmission\nfunction, i.e., the minimum expected distortion that can be achieved when the\nexpected number of transmissions is less than or equal to a particular value.\nIn particular, we show that the distortion-transmission function is a piecewise\nlinear, convex, and decreasing function. We also give an explicit\ncharacterization of each vertex of the piecewise linear function.\n  To prove the results, the optimization problem is cast as a decentralized\nconstrained stochastic control problem. We first consider the Lagrange\nrelaxation of the constrained problem and identify the structure of optimal\ntransmission and estimation strategies. In particular, we show that the optimal\ntransmission is of a threshold type. Using these structural results, we obtain\ndynamic programs for the Lagrange relaxations. We identify the performance of\nan arbitrary threshold-type transmission strategy and use the idea of\ncalibration from multi-armed bandits to determine the optimal transmission\nstrategy for the Lagrange relaxation. Finally, we show that the optimal\nstrategy for the constrained setup is a randomized strategy that randomizes\nbetween two deterministic strategies that differ only at one state. By\nevaluating the performance of these strategies, we determine the shape of the\ndistortion-transmission function.

In the past years, several experiments have been\nperformed to determine the mass and velocity regimes at which perfect bouncing\ndoes occur and those where there is a chance of the aggregates sticking\ntogether. We conducted a microgravity experiment, which allows us to\ninvestigate free collisions of millimeter-sized SiO2 dust aggregates at the\nrelevant velocities. We analyzed 52 collisions in detail with velocities of 3.4\nmm/s to 6.2 cm/s and found four of them leading to sticking, while the other\naggregates rebounded. Three out of the four sticking collisions occurred at\nvelocities where previously only bouncing had been predicted. Although the\nprobability for sticking is low, this opens a new possibility for growth beyond\nmillimeter sizes. Our setup allowed us to obtain the complete three-dimensional\ncollision information. Since most previous experiments were interpreted based\non two-dimensional information, we compare our three-dimensional values with\nthose obtained if only one projection had been available. We find that the\nerror of a two-dimensional analysis of the collision velocity is very small.\nThe distribution of the coefficient of restitution in the two-dimensional view\nis representative of the real case, but for any given collision its value can\nbe far off.

This source\nwas initially given the identification IGR J00569-7226. Subsequent\nmulti-wavelength observations identified the system as new Be/X-ray binary\nsystem in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Follow-up X-ray observations by Swift and\nXMM-Newton revealed an X-ray pulse period of 5.05s and that the system\nunderwent regular occulation/eclipse behaviour every 17d. This is the first\nreported eclipsing Be/X-ray binary system in the SMC, and only the second such\nsystem known to date. Furthermore, the nature of the occultation makes it\npossible to use the neutron star to X-ray the circumstellar disk, thereby, for\nthe first time, revealing direct observational evidence for its size and clumpy\nstructure. Swift timing measurements allowed for the binary solution to be\ncalculated from the Doppler shifted X-ray pulsations.

Recently, the mutation of the Glu47 residue into\nalanine (E47A) in the active site of SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii has\nallowed the stabilization of an iron-peroxo species when quickly reacted with\nH(2)O(2) [Math{\\'e} et al. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 4966-4967]. To further\ninvestigate this non-heme peroxo-iron species, we have carried out a\nM{\\\"o}ssbauer study of the (57)Fe-enriched E47A SOR from D. baarsii reacted\nquickly with H(2)O(2). Considering the M{\\\"o}ssbauer data, we conclude, in\nconjunction with the other spectroscopic data available and with the results of\ndensity functional calculations on related models, that this species\ncorresponds to a high-spin side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) complex. This is one of the\nfirst examples of such a species in a biological system for which M{\\\"o}ssbauer\nparameters are now available: delta(/Fe) = 0.54 (1) mm/s, DeltaE(Q) = -0.80 (5)\nmm/s, and the asymmetry parameter eta = 0.60 (5) mm/s. The M{\\\"o}ssbauer and\nspin Hamiltonian parameters have been evaluated on a model from the side-on\nperoxo complex (model 2) issued from the oxidized iron center in SOR from\nPyrococcus furiosus, for which structural data are available in the literature\n[Yeh et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 2499-2508]. For comparison, similar\ncalculations have been carried out on a model derived from 2 (model 3), where\nthe [CH(3)-S](1)(-) group has been replaced by the neutral [NH(3)](0) group\n[Neese and Solomon (1998) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 12829-12848]. Both models 2\nand 3 contain a formally high-spin Fe(3+) ion (i.e., with empty minority spin\norbitals). We found, however, a significant fraction (approximately 0.6 for 2,\napproximately 0.8 for 3) of spin (equivalently charge) spread over two occupied\n(minority spin) orbitals. The quadrupole splitting value for 2 is found to be\nnegative and matches quite well the experimental value. The computed quadrupole\ntensors are rhombic in the case of 2 and axial in the case of 3. This\ndifference originates directly from the presence of the thiolate ligand in 2. A\ncorrelation between experimental isomer shifts for Fe(3+) mononuclear complexes\nwith computed electron densities at the iron nucleus has been built and used to\nevaluate the isomer shift values for 2 and 3 (0.56 and 0.63 mm/s,\nrespectively). A significant increase of isomer shift value is found upon going\nfrom a methylthiolate to a nitrogen ligand for the Fe(3+) ion, consistent with\ncovalency effects due to the presence of the axial thiolate ligand. Considering\nthat the isomer shift value for 3 is likely to be in the 0.61-0.65 mm/s range\n[Horner et al. (2002) Eur. J. Inorg. Chem., 3278-3283], the isomer shift value\nfor a high-spin eta(2)-O(2) Fe(3+) complex with an axial thiolate group can be\nestimated to be in the 0.54-0.58 mm/s range. The occurrence of a side-on peroxo\nintermediate in SOR is discussed in relation to the recent data published for a\nside-on peroxo-Fe(3+) species in another biological system [Karlsson et al.\n(2003) Science 299, 1039-1042].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 13:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-11"}

The high-definition nanostructures are fabricated with\nfocused ion-beam (FIB) milling into an ultrasmooth single-crystalline aluminum\nfilm grown on a semiconducting GaAs substrate with molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)\nmethod. The single-crystalline aluminum film shows improved reflectivity and\nreduced two-photon photoluminescence (TPPL) due to the ultrasmooth surface.\nBoth linear scattering and non-linear TPPL are studied in detail.

Our main interest concerns\nrational integrable spin chains and lattice models. We recall the relation\namong them and how they can be solved using Bethe ansatz methods incorporating\nso-called Q-functions. In order to remind the reader how the Yangian emerges in\nthis context, an overview of its so-called RTT-realization is provided. The\nmain part is based on the author's original publications. Firstly, we construct\nQ-operators whose eigenvalues yield the Q-functions for rational homogeneous\nspin chains. The Q-operators are introduced as traces over certain monodromies\nof R-operators. Our construction allows us to derive the hierarchy of commuting\nQ-operators and the functional relations among them. We study how the\nnearest-neighbor Hamiltonian and in principle also higher local charges can be\nextracted from the Q-operators directly. Secondly, we formulate the Yangian\ninvariance condition, also studied in relation to scattering amplitudes of N=4\nsuper Yang-Mills theory, in the RTT-realization. We find that Yangian\ninvariants can be interpreted as special eigenvectors of certain inhomogeneous\nspin chains.

The usual\ndefinition of the survival probability which takes into account only the time\nevolution of an unstable system leads to a relation between the survival\nprobability of the system in motion and that of the system at rest which is\ndifferent from the standard relation based on relativistic time dilation. This\napproach led other authors to claim non-standard quantum-mechanical effects\nwhich are in clear contradiction with Special Relativity. We show that an\nappropriate relativistic definition of the survival probability which takes\ninto account also the space evolution of an unstable system leads to the\nstandard relation between the survival probability of the system in motion and\nthat of the system at rest, in agreement with Special Relativity.
