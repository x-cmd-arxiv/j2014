The generalized minimal massive gravity\ntheory is realized by adding the CS deformation term, the higher derivative\ndeformation term, and an extra term to pure Einstein gravity with a negative\ncosmological constant. We study the linearized excitations around the $AdS_3$\nbackground and find that at special point (tricritical) in parameter space the\ntwo massive graviton solutions become massless and they are replaced by two\nsolutions with logarithmic and logarithmic-squared boundary behavior. So it is\nnatural to proposed that GMMG model could also provide a holographic\ndescription for a $3-$rank Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory (LCFT). We\ncalculate the energy of the linearized gravitons in $AdS_3$ background, and\nshow that the theory is free of negative-energy bulk modes. Then we obtain the\ncentral charges of the CFT dual explicitly and show GMMG also avoids the\naforementioned \"bulk-boundary unitarity clash\". After that we show that General\nZwei-Dreibein Gravity (GZDG) model can reduce to GMMG model. Finally by a\nHamiltonian analysis we show that the GMMG model has no Boulware-Deser ghosts\nand this model propagate only two physical modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 12:08:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Jan 2015 05:51:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 11:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

In this\nwork, we outline a general protocol to construct objective-oriented persistent\nhomology methods. The minimization of the objective functional leads to a\nLaplace-Beltrami operator which generates a multiscale representation of the\ninitial data and offers an objective oriented filtration process. The resulting\ndifferential geometry based objective-oriented persistent homology is able to\npreserve desirable geometric features in the evolutionary filtration and\nenhances the corresponding topological persistence.

The convergence and reliability of the present Laplace-Beltrami flow\nbased cubical complex filtration approach are analyzed over various spatial and\ntemporal mesh sizes. The efficiency and robustness of the present method are\nverified by more than 500 fullerene molecules.

To remove noise, we employ geometric flows which are found to preserve\nthe intrinsic topological fingerprints of cryo-EM structures and diminish the\ntopological signature of noise. In particular, persistent homology enables us\nto visualize the gradual separation of the topological fingerprints of cryo-EM\nstructures from those of noise during the denoising process, which gives rise\nto a practical procedure for prescribing a noise threshold to extract cryo-EM\nstructure information from noise contaminated data after certain iterations of\nthe geometric flow equation.

We study\nthe case in which tidal heating drives mass loss from a low mass satellite. The\nstream effectively has two dynamical components, a common angular momentum core\nsuperposed with episodic pulses with a broader angular momentum distribution.\nThe pulses appear as spurs on the stream, oscillating above and below the\nstream centerline, stretching and blurring in configuration space as they move\naway from the cluster. Low orbital eccentricity streams are smoother and have\nless differential motion than high eccentricity streams. The tail of a high\neccentricity stream can develop a fan of particles which wraps around at\napocenter in a shell feature. We show that scaling the essentially stationary\naction-angle variables with the cube root of the satellite mass allows a low\nmass satellite stream to accurately predict the features in the stream from a\nsatellite a thousand times more massive. As a practical astrophysical\napplication, we demonstrate that narrow gaps in a moderate eccentricity stream,\nsuch as GD-1, blur out to 50\\% contrast over approximately 6 radial periods. A\nhigh eccentricity stream, such as Pal~5, will blur small gaps in only radial 2\norbits as can be understood from the much larger dispersion of angular momentum\nin the stream.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2014 22:08:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2014 20:17:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The\nconstructed model is then applied to predict the cross sections of $\\nu + d\n\\rightarrow \\mu^- + \\pi^+ + n+ p$ and $\\nu +d \\rightarrow \\mu^-+\\pi^0+p+p$\nreactions. The importance of including the $NN$ final state interactions to\nunderstand the experimental data of these neutrino-deuteron reactions is\ndemonstrated. Our results strongly suggest that the spectator approximation\nused in the previous analyses to extract the pion production cross sections on\nthe nucleon from the data on the deuteron is not valid for the $\\nu + d\n\\rightarrow \\mu^-+ \\pi^+ +n+p$, but is a good approximation for $\\nu + d\n\\rightarrow \\mu^-+ \\pi^0 + p+p$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2014 23:40:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 16:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

A salient\nproblem, however, is that it does not occur exactly at the Coulomb interaction,\nbut rather at a modified interaction, which favors particle-hole symmetry\nbreaking. In an effort to find a better state, in this work, we investigate the\npossible connection between the paired QH state and the antisymmetrized bilayer\nground state, which is inspired by the intriguing identity that the MR Pfaffian\nstate is entirely equivalent to the antisymmetrized projection of the bilayer\nQH state called the Halperin (331) state, which is valid at interlayer\ndistance, $d$, roughly equal to the magnetic length, $l_{\\rm B}$. Specifically,\nby using exact diagonalization in the torus geometry, we show that the exact\n$5/2$ state at a given Haldane pseudopotential variation is intimately\nconnected with the antisymmetrized bilayer ground state at a corresponding\n$d/l_{\\rm B}$ via one-to-one mapping, which we call the bilayer mapping. One of\nthe most important discoveries in this work is that the paired QH state\noccurring at the Coulomb interaction is mapped onto the antisymmetrized bilayer\nground state at $d \\gg l_{\\rm B}$, which is equivalent to the antisymmetrized\nproduct state of two composite fermion seas at quarter filling, not the MR\nPfaffian state. While maintaining high overlap with the paired QH state, the\nantisymmetrized bilayer ground state at $d \\gg l_{\\rm B}$ exhibits an abrupt\nchange under the influence of small anisotropy. This suggests that the paired\nQH state occurring at the Coulomb interaction might be susceptible to\nanisotropic instability, opening up the possibility of anisotropic $p_x$ or\n$p_y$-wave pairing instead of $p_x \\pm i p_y$-wave pairing in the MR\nPfaffian/anti-Pfaffian state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 02:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Part of the current is shunted through the ferromagnet\nwhich generates spin transfer torque in the ferromagnet. The combination of the\nspin transfer torque and exchange interaction torque along with\nvoltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) allows ultralow-energy switching\nof the ferromagnet.

We show that the metallicities of more than 80,000 Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) galaxies in the low-redshift range $0.07\\leq z\\leq 0.3$\nconsiderably constrain stellar evolution models that simultaneously relate\ngalaxy stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rates (SFRs) to the infall\nrate of low-metallicity extragalactic gas and outflow of enriched matter. A\nfeature of our model is that it encompasses both the active star forming phases\nof a galaxy and epochs during which the same galaxy may lie fallow. We show\nthat the galaxy-mass-metallicity-star-formation relation can be traced to\ninfall of extragalactic gas mixing with native gas from host galaxies to form\nstars of observed metallicities, the most massive of which eject oxygen into\nextragalactic space. Most consequential among our findings is that, on average,\nextragalactic infall accounts for one half of the gas required for star\nformation, a ratio that is remarkably constant across galaxies with stellar\nmasses ranging at least from $M* = 2 \\times 10^9$ to $6\\times 10^{10}\nM_{\\odot}$.

In particular, polynomial approximations to the\nsign function underly algorithms for agnostically learning halfspaces, as well\nas pseudorandom generators for halfspaces. In this work, we investigate the\nlimits of these techniques by proving inapproximability results for the sign\nfunction.\n  Firstly, the polynomial regression algorithm of Kalai et al. (SIAM J. Comput.\n2008) shows that halfspaces can be learned with respect to log-concave\ndistributions on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ in the challenging agnostic learning model. The\npower of this algorithm relies on the fact that under log-concave\ndistributions, halfspaces can be approximated arbitrarily well by low-degree\npolynomials. We ask whether this technique can be extended beyond log-concave\ndistributions, and establish a negative result. We show that polynomials of any\ndegree cannot approximate the sign function to within arbitrarily low error for\na large class of non-log-concave distributions on the real line, including\nthose with densities proportional to $\\exp(-|x|^{0.99})$.\n  Secondly, we investigate the derandomization of Chernoff-type concentration\ninequalities.

Nevertheless, in many practical\napplications such as direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and line spectral\nestimation, the sparsifying dictionary is usually characterized by a set of\nunknown parameters in a continuous domain. To apply the conventional compressed\nsensing technique to such applications, the continuous parameter space has to\nbe discretized to a finite set of grid points, based on which a \"presumed\ndictionary\" is constructed for sparse signal recovery. Discretization, however,\ninevitably incurs errors since the true parameters do not necessarily lie on\nthe discretized grid. This error, also referred to as grid mismatch, may lead\nto deteriorated recovery performance or even recovery failure. To address this\nissue, in this paper, we propose a generalized iterative reweighted L2 method\nwhich jointly estimates the sparse signals and the unknown parameters\nassociated with the true dictionary. The proposed algorithm is developed by\niteratively decreasing a surrogate function majorizing a given objective\nfunction, resulting in a gradual and interweaved iterative process to refine\nthe unknown parameters and the sparse signal. A simple yet effective scheme is\ndeveloped for adaptively updating the regularization parameter that controls\nthe tradeoff between the sparsity of the solution and the data fitting error.\nExtension of the proposed algorithm to the multiple measurement vector scenario\nis also considered. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves\na super-resolution accuracy and presents superiority over other existing\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 08:09:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 07:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-19"}

A fossil\nrecord method based on spectral synthesis techniques is used to recover\nspatially and temporally resolved maps of stellar population properties of\nspheroidal and spiral galaxies with masses $10^9$ to $7 \\times 10^{11}$\nM$_\\odot$. The results show that galaxy-wide spatially averaged stellar\npopulation properties (stellar mass, mass surface density, age, metallicity,\nand extinction) match those obtained from the integrated spectrum, and that\nthese spatially averaged properties match those at $R = 1$ HLR (half light\nradius), proving that the effective radii are really effective.\n  Further, the individual radial profiles of the stellar mass surface density\n($\\mu_\\star$), luminosity weighted ages ($< {\\rm log}\\,age>_L$), and mass\nweighted metallicity ($< \\log Z_\\star >_M$) are stacked in bins of galaxy\nmorphology (E, S0, Sa, Sb, Sbc, Sc and Sd). All these properties show negative\ngradients as a sign of the inside-out growth of massive galaxies. However, the\ngradients depend on the Hubble type in different ways. For the same galaxy\nmass, E and S0 galaxies show the largest inner gradients in $\\mu_\\star$; while\nMW-like galaxies (Sb with $M_\\star \\sim 10^{11} M_\\odot$) show the largest\ninner age and metallicity gradients. The age and metallicity gradients suggest\nthat major mergers have a relevant role in growing the center (within 3 HLR) of\nmassive early type galaxies; and radial mixing may play a role flattening the\nradial metallicity gradient in MW-like disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 09:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-09"}

We searched\nACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Inspec, ISI Web of Science and Springer as\nwell as relevant open-access journals for relevant articles. A total of 237\nstudies were first searched, of which 44 papers met the Include Criteria. The\nstudies identified three types of studied areas about cloud computing in\neHealth, namely (1) cloud-based eHealth framework design (n=13); (2)\napplications of cloud computing (n=17); and (3) security or privacy control\nmechanisms of healthcare data in the cloud (n=14). Most of the studies in the\nreview were about designs and concept-proof. Only very few studies have\nevaluated their research in the real world, which may indicate that the\napplication of cloud computing in eHealth is still very immature. However, our\npresented review could pinpoint that a hybrid cloud platform with mixed access\ncontrol and security protection mechanisms will be a main research area for\ndeveloping citizen centred home-based healthcare applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 09:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-09"}

In\naddition to the AMS-02 data, we add HESS data to estimate the spectra of CR\nelectrons and the diffuse gamma rays above TeV. In the conventional diffusion\nmodel, a global analysis is performed on the spectral features of CR electrons\nand the diffuse gamma rays by GALRPOP package. The results show that the\nspectrum structure of the primary component of CR electrons can not be fully\nreproduced by a simple power law and the relevant break is around hundred GeV.\nAt 99\\% C.L., the injection indices above the break decrease from 2.54 to 2.35,\nbut the ones below the break are only in the range 2.746 - 2.751. The spectrum\nof CR electrons does not need to add TeV cutoff to match the features of HESS\ndata too. Based on the difference between the fluxes of CR electrons and the\nprimary component of them, the predicted excess of CR positrons is consistent\nwith the interpretations as pulsar or dark matter. In the analysis of the\nGalactic diffuse gamma rays with the indirect constraint of AMS-02 and HESS\ndata, it is found that the fluxes of Galactic diffuse gamma rays are consistent\nwith GeV data of Fermi-LAT in the high latitude regions. The results indicate\nthat the inverse Compton scattering(IC) is the dominant component in the range\nof the hundred GeV to tens of TeV respectively from the high latitude regions\nto the low ones, and in the all regions of Galaxy the flux of diffuse gamma\nrays is less than CR electrons at the energy scale of 20 TeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 10:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 09:58:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 02:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-06"}

In this work we analyze such\nproblem from two approximate but valuable perspectives: the classical limit and\nthe limit of small quantum fluctuations.

In this state the electric current that is induced by the\nZeeman interaction is exactly counterbalanced by the current produced by the\ngradient of the order-parameter. We studied the interplay of the helix state\nand magnetoelectric current in the case of a varying in space Zeeman field, as\nit might be realized in hybrid heterostructures with magnetic and\nsuperconducting layers.

The fluctuations, on the other hand, provide the\ndominant contribution to the preexponential factor, which increases with\ntemperature and the length of the wire. More important is that thermal\nfluctuations give rise to a decay of an initial correlation between Majorana\nedge states to its stationary value after some thermalization time. This\nstationary value is sensitive to the temperature and to the length of the wire,\nand, although vanishing in the thermodynamic limit, can still be feasible in a\nmesoscopic system at sufficiently low temperatures.

Alanine has\nonly a single methyl group attached to its chiral center, which makes the\nnumber of possible binding conformations computationally tractable.\nAdditionally, only the amine and carboxyl group are expected to interact\nstrongly with the Pt substrate. On Pt(531) we study the molecule in its\npristine as well as its deprotonated form and find that the deprotonated one is\nmore stable by 0.39 eV. Therefore, we study the molecule in its deprotonated\nform on Pt(321) and Pt(643).

It is required to create technical awareness in users\nby educating them to create a phishing detection application which would\ngenerate phishing alerts for the user so that phishing messages are not\nignored. The lack of basic security features to detect and prevent phishing has\nhad a profound effect on the IM clients, as they lose their faith in e-banking\nand e-commerce transactions, which will have a disastrous impact on the\ncorporate and banking sectors and businesses which rely heavily on the\ninternet. Very little research contributions were available in for phishing\ndetection in Instant messengers. A context based, dynamic and intelligent\nphishing detection methodology in IMs is proposed, to analyze and detect\nphishing in Instant Messages with relevance to domain ontology (OBIE) and\nutilizes the Classification based on Association (CBA) for generating phishing\nrules and alerting the victims. A PDS Monitoring system algorithm is used to\nidentify the phishing activity during exchange of messages in IMs, with high\nratio of precision and recall. The results have shown improvement by the\nincreased percentage of precision and recall when compared to the existing\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 11:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}
