They\nare produced by propagating periodic 2D diffraction patterns and can be\nvisualized as 3D stacks of Talbot carpets. The nonlinear Talbot effect\noriginates from 2D rogue waves and forms in a bulk 3D nonlinear medium. The\nrecurrences of an input rogue wave are observed at the Talbot length and at the\nhalf-Talbot length, with a \\pi phase shift; no other recurrences are observed.\nDifferent from the nonlinear Talbot effect, the linear effect displays the\nusual fractional Talbot images as well. We also find that the smaller the\nperiod of incident rogue waves, the shorter the Talbot length. Increasing the\nbeam intensity increases the Talbot length, but above a threshold this leads to\na catastrophic self-focusing phenomenon which destroys the effect. We also find\nthat the Talbot recurrence can be viewed as a self-Fourier transform of the\ninitial periodic beam that is automatically performed during propagation. In\nparticular, linear Talbot effect can be viewed as a fractional self-Fourier\ntransform, whereas the nonlinear Talbot effect can be viewed as the regular\nself-Fourier transform. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the rogue wave\ninitial condition is sufficient but not necessary for the observation of the\neffect. It may also be observed from other periodic inputs, provided they are\nset on a finite background. The 2D effect may find utility in the production of\n3D photonic crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Nov 2014 16:13:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 13:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

Recently, there has been a significant effort\non understanding the basic mechanisms to solve blind deconvolution. While this\neffort resulted in the deployment of effective algorithms, the theoretical\nfindings generated contrasting views on why these approaches worked. On the one\nhand, one could observe experimentally that alternating energy minimization\nalgorithms converge to the desired solution. On the other hand, it has been\nshown that such alternating minimization algorithms should fail to converge and\none should instead use a so-called Variational Bayes approach. To clarify this\nconundrum, recent work showed that a good image and blur prior is instead what\nmakes a blind deconvolution algorithm work. Unfortunately, this analysis did\nnot apply to algorithms based on total variation regularization. In this\nmanuscript, we provide both analysis and experiments to get a clearer picture\nof blind deconvolution. Our analysis reveals the very reason why an algorithm\nbased on total variation works.

In a later article, T.\nBodineau, I. Gallagher and L. Saint-Raymond study the dynamics of a tagged\nparticle among N other identical particles in the same asymptotic regime, and\nprove the validity of the linear Boltzmann equation on arbitrary large periods\nof time as N tends to infinity. Using classical results on the asymptotic\ntheory of the linear Boltzmann equation, the same authors prove that the\nstochastic process known as the \"Brownian motion\" describes a particular limit\nof the deterministic dynamics of interacting particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Nov 2014 18:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

In this paper we\ninvestigate the complexity of finding a solution satisfying additional\nconstraints on restricted pairs of agents. Restricted pairs can be either\nforced or forbidden. A stable solution must contain all of the forced pairs,\nwhile it must contain none of the forbidden pairs.\n  Dias et al. gave a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether such a\nsolution exists in the presence of restricted edges.

The proof depends on a new general position-type result\nin a singular setting. This result is proven in the Appendix and may be of\nindependent interest.\n  We also obtain new information regarding the homotopy groups of the subspaces\nY. Recent work of Biswas and Lawton determined the fundamental group of X for\ngeneral G, and we describe the fundamental group of Y.

The most suitable Hydrogen and Magnesium atomic models are\nselected by performing several tests of the code. The influence of the\nionization degree on the line profiles is also studied. Radiative-MHD\nsimulations of the solar atmosphere, obtained with the Bifrost code, are used\nas input data for calculation of synthetic spectra of the H-alpha and Mg II h&k\nlines for particular locations evolving with time. The spectral line variations\nreveal the presence of MHD waves in the simulation results. We construct\noscillation power spectra of the line intensity for different wavelength, and\ncompare these with the corresponding height-dependent power spectra of\natmospheric parameters from the simulations. We find correlations between the\npower spectra of intensities of the line profiles at certain wavelengths and\nthe power spectra of the atmospheric parameters at the tau-unity heights for\nthese wavelengths. These results provide a new diagnostic method of\nchromospheric oscillations; however, larger amounts of data are needed to\nconfirm these correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Nov 2014 21:20:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

We first compute the surface number density of SDSS DR7 galaxies as a\nfunction of the $r$-band extinction, $A_{r,\\rm SFD}$. We confirm that the\nsurface densities of those galaxies positively correlate with $A_{r,\\rm SFD}$\nfor $A_{r,\\rm SFD}<0.1$, as first discovered by Yahata et al. (2007) for SDSS\nDR4 galaxies.

Then we search for the mean and r.m.s values of $y$ that fit\nthe observed anomaly using the analytic model. The required values to reproduce\nthe anomaly are roughly consistent with those measured from the stacking\nanalysis of SDSS galaxies (Kashiwagi, Yahata, & Suto 2013). Due to the\nlimitation of our statistical modeling, we are not yet able to remove the FIR\ncontamination of galaxies from the extinction map. Nevertheless the agreement\nwith the model prediction suggests that the FIR emission of galaxies is mainly\nresponsible for the observed anomaly.

A vast body of work has explored how firing\nrates in individual cells and correlations in the spikes of cell pairs impact\ncoding. But little is known about how higher-order correlations, which describe\nsimultaneous firing in triplets and larger ensembles of cells, impact encoded\nstimulus information. Here, we take a first step toward closing this gap. We\nvary triplet correlations in small (~10 cell) neural populations while keeping\nsingle cell and pairwise statistics fixed at typically reported values. For\neach value of triplet correlations, we estimate the performance of the neural\npopulation on a two-stimulus discrimination task. We identify a predominant way\nthat such triplet correlations can strongly enhance coding: if triplet\ncorrelations differ for the two stimuli, they skew the response distributions\nof the two stimuli apart from each other, separating them and making them\neasier to distinguish. This coding benefit does not occur when both stimuli\nelicit similar triplet correlations. These results indicate that higher-order\ncorrelations could have a strong effect on population coding. Finally, we\ncalculate how many samples are necessary to accurately measure spiking\ncorrelations of this type, providing an estimate of the necessary recording\ntimes in experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 07:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

It has practically useful interpretation as the expected\nremaining lifetime given survival up to a particular time point, and it also\ncharacterizes the survival distribution. However, it has received limited\nattention in terms of inference methods under a probabilistic modeling\nframework. In this paper, we seek to provide general inference methodology for\nmean residual life regression. Survival data often include a set of predictor\nvariables for the survival response distribution, and in many cases it is\nnatural to include the covariates as random variables into the modeling. We\nthus propose a Dirichlet process mixture modeling approach for the joint\nstochastic mechanism of the covariates and survival responses. This approach\nimplies a flexible model structure for the mean residual life of the\nconditional response distribution, allowing general shapes for mean residual\nlife as a function of covariates given a specific time point, as well as a\nfunction of time given particular values of the covariate vector. To expand the\nscope of the modeling framework, we extend the mixture model to incorporate\ndependence across experimental groups, such as treatment and control groups.\nThis extension is built from a dependent Dirichlet process prior for the\ngroup-specific mixing distributions, with common locations and weights that\nvary across groups through latent bivariate beta distributed random variables.\nWe develop properties of the proposed regression models, and discuss methods\nfor prior specification and posterior inference. The different components of\nthe methodology are illustrated with simulated data sets.

We detect a single radio component at 1.6\nGHz, but not at 5 GHz implying a spectral index steeper than $-1.5\\pm0.5$\n($S_\\nu\\propto\\nu^\\alpha$). The high brightness temperature of the radio\ncomponent ($\\sim1.4\\times10^7$ K) and the steep radio spectrum support a\nnon-thermal synchrotron origin. A crude estimate of the black hole mass derived\nfrom the $M_{BH}-\\sigma_{\\star}$ relation is $\\sim1.4\\pm1.0\\times10^8$ Msun; it\nis accreting at an Eddington rate of $\\sim0.02$. The radio data are consistent\nwith either the radio emission coming from the parsec-scale base of a\nsynchrotron wind originating in the magnetised corona above the accretion disk,\nor from the inner ionised edge of the accretion disk or torus. In the former\ncase, the narrow line region (NLR) clouds may form a part of the broad outflow,\nwhile in the latter, the NLR clouds may form a part of an extended disk beyond\nthe torus. The radio and NLR emission may also be decoupled so that the radio\nemission originates in an outflow while the NLR is in a disk, and vice versa.\nWhile with the present data, it is not possible to clearly distinguish between\nthese scenarios, there appears to be greater circumstantial evidence supporting\nthe coronal wind picture in KISSR1494. From the kiloparsec-scale radio\nemission, the time-averaged kinetic power of this outflow is estimated to be\n$Q\\approx1.5\\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is typical of radio outflows in\nlow-luminosity AGN. This supports the idea that radio \"jets\" and outflowing\ncoronal winds are indistinguishable in Seyfert galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 10:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The nature of this stochastic process carries\ninformation on how GRB inner engines work. The so-called interpulse time\ndefines the interval between adjacent pulses, excluding the long quiescence\nperiods during which the signal drops to the background level. It was found by\nmany authors in the past that interpulse times are lognormally distributed, at\nvariance with the exponential case that is expected for a memoryless process.\nWe investigated whether the simple hypothesis of a temporally uncorrelated\nsequence of pulses is really to be rejected, as a lognormal distribution\nnecessarily implies. We selected and analysed a number of multi--peaked\nCGRO/BATSE GRBs and simulated similar time profiles, with the crucial\ndifference that we assumed exponentially distributed interpulse times, as is\nexpected for a memoryless stationary Poisson process. We then identified peaks\nin both data sets using a novel peak search algorithm, which is more efficient\nthan others used in the past. We independently confirmed that the observed\ninterpulse time distribution is approximately lognormal. However, we found the\nsame results on the simulated profiles, in spite of the intrinsic exponential\ndistribution. Although intrinsic lognormality cannot be ruled out, this shows\nthat intrinsic interpulse time distribution in real data could still be\nexponential, while the observed lognormal could be ascribed to the low\nefficiency of peak search algorithms at short values combined with the\nlimitations of a bin-integrated profile. Our result suggests that GRB engines\nmay emit pulses after the fashion of nuclear radioactive decay, that is, as a\nmemoryless process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 10:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

Since the observed\nspatial distribution of the C2H and c-C3H2 emission is similar but does not\nfollow the PAH emission, we conclude that, in high UV-flux PDRs,\nphotodestruction of PAHs is not a necessary requirement to explain the observed\nabundances of the smallest hydrocarbons. Instead, gas-phase endothermic\nreactions (or with barriers) between C+, radicals and H2 enhance the formation\nof simple hydrocarbons. Observations and models suggest that the [C2H]/[c-C3H2]\nratio (~32 at the PDR edge) decreases with the UV field attenuation. The\nobserved low cyclic-to-linear C3H column density ratio (<3) is consistent with\na high electron abundance (Xe) PDR environment. In fact, the poorly constrained\nXe gradient influences much of the hydrocarbon chemistry in the more\nUV-shielded gas. We propose that reactions of C2H isotopologues with 13C+ and H\natoms can explain the observed [C13CH]/[13CCH]=1.4(0.1) fractionation level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 10:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 19:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

In this paper, we first perform detailed modeling of grain\nalignment by RATs for the IC 63 reflection nebula illuminated both by a nearby\n$\\gamma$ Cas star and the diffuse interstellar radiation field. We calculate\nlinear polarization $p_{\\lambda}$ of background stars by radiatively aligned\ngrains and explore the variation of fractional polarization ($p_{\\lambda}/A_V$)\nwith visual extinction $A_{V}$ across the cloud. Our results show that the\nvariation of $p_{V}/A_{V}$ versus $A_{V}$ from the dayside of IC 63 to its\ncenter can be represented by a power-law ($p_{V}/A_{V}\\propto A_{V}^{\\eta}$)\nwith different slopes depending on $A_{V}$.

The exchange between itinerant and\nlocalized electrons is antiferromanetic. As a result the external magnetic\nfield, applied along the magnetization of the localized electrons, compensates\nthe Zeeman splitting due to the spin-fermion exchange and magnon-fermion\ninteraction induces spin anti-parallel p-wave superconductivity which coexists\nwith magnetism. We have obtained five characteristic values of the applied\nfield (in units of energy) $H_{cr1}<H_3<H_0<H_4<H_{cr2}$. At $H_0$ the external\nmagnetic field compensates the Zeeman splitting. When $H_{cr1}<H<H_{cr2}$ the\nspin antiparallel p-wave superconductivity with $T_{1u}$ configuration coexists\nwith magnetism. The superconductor to normal magnet transition at finite\ntemperature is second order when $H$ runs the interval $(H_3,H_4)$. It is an\nabrupt transition when $H_{cr1}<H<H_3$ or $H_4<H<H_{cr2}$. This is proved\ncalculating the temperature dependence of the gap for three different values of\nthe external magnetic field $H_{cr1}<H<H_3$, $H_4<H<H_{cr2}$ and $H=H_0$. In\nthe first two cases the abrupt fall to zero of the gap at superconducting\ncritical temperature shows that the superconductor to normal magnet transition\nis first order. The Hubbard term (Coulomb repulsion), in a weak coupling\nregime, does not affect significantly the magnon induced superconductivity.\nRelying on the above results one can formulate a recipe for preparing a\nsuperconductor from ferrimagnetic spinel: i) hydrostatic pressure above the\ncritical value of insulator-metal transition. ii) external magnetic field along\nthe sublattice magnetization with higher amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 12:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Secondly,\na global fit to the whole data set and local fits to shorter segments are\ncomputed with the period that is found to be the optimal one. The harmonic\nleast-squares analysis of all the available data reveals a short period close\nto 1.6 days as a limiting value for a set of significant frequencies.

Weak modulation signal is, indeed retrieved, with\na period of roughly 6.9 years. The phase dispersion analysis gives a clear\nsymmetric minimum for coherence times lower than and around 100 days. We\ninterpret this as the mean rotation period of the spots (1.60514 days), and\nthis value is chosen to be used as the carrier period for the CF analysis.

As the nature\nof superconductivity in these materials is still not disclosed, the prospects\nfor a higher Tc are not clear. In contrast the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)\ntheory gives a clear guide for achieving high Tc: it should be a favorable\ncombination of high frequency phonons, strong coupling between electrons and\nphonons, and high density of states. These conditions can be fulfilled for\nmetallic hydrogen and covalent hydrogen dominant compounds.

Here we found that\nsulfur hydride transforms at P~90 GPa to metal and superconductor with Tc\nincreasing with pressure to 150 K at ~200 GPa.

This superconductivity likely associates with the dissociation of H2S,\nand formation of SHn (n>2) hydrides. We proved occurrence of superconductivity\nby the drop of the resistivity at least 50 times lower than the copper\nresistivity, the decrease of Tc with magnetic field, and the strong isotope\nshift of Tc in D2S which evidences a major role of phonons in the\nsuperconductivity.

Firstly, to find lower-dimensional\nrepresentations of the unknown parameter vector that capture as much as\npossible of the associated posterior density, and secondly to enable the\ncomputation of the approximate posterior density with as few forward calls as\npossible.

The second is governed by a\npower-like distributions of transverse momenta with power index $n$ at\nhigh-$p_T$ associated with the hard scattering between partons. We show that\nthe hard-scattering integral can be approximated as a nonextensive distribution\nof a quasi-power-law containing a scale parameter $T$ and a power index $n=1/(q\n-1)$, where $q$ is the nonextensivity parameter.

We perform similar one-loop computations in 11d supergravity on\nAdS_7 x S^4 and 10d supergravity on AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4.

In this\npaper, we are motivated to investigate the superfluidity of a BEC with PMI\ntrapped in an optical lattice (OL). In particular, we explore the effects of\nPMI on the sound speed and the dynamical structure factor of the model system.\nOur numerical results, combined with the analytical results in both the\nweak-potential limit and the tight-binding limit, have shown that the PMI can\nstrongly modify the sound speed of a BEC. Moreover, we have shown that the\neffects of PMI on sound speed can be experimentally probed via the dynamic\nstructure factor, where the excitation strength toward the first Bogoliubov\nband exhibits marked difference from the non- PMI one. Our predictions of the\neffects of PMI on the sound speed can be tested using the Bragg spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 12:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}
