At present, the best upper bound known for the power of quantum\ncomputation is that BQP is in AWPP. This work investigates limits on\ncomputational power that are imposed by physical principles. To this end, we\ndefine a circuit-based model of computation in a class of operationally-defined\ntheories more general than quantum theory, and ask: what is the minimal set of\nphysical assumptions under which the above inclusion still holds? We show that\ngiven only an assumption of tomographic locality (roughly, that multipartite\nstates can be characterised by local measurements), efficient computations are\ncontained in AWPP. This inclusion still holds even without assuming a basic\nnotion of causality (where the notion is, roughly, that probabilities for\noutcomes cannot depend on future measurement choices). Following Aaronson, we\nextend the computational model by allowing post-selection on measurement\noutcomes. Aaronson showed that the corresponding quantum complexity class is\nequal to PP. Given only the assumption of tomographic locality, the inclusion\nin PP still holds for post-selected computation in general theories. Thus in a\nworld with post-selection, quantum theory is optimal for computation in the\nspace of all general theories. We then consider if relativised complexity\nresults can be obtained for general theories. It is not clear how to define a\nsensible notion of an oracle in the general framework that reduces to the\nstandard notion in the quantum case. Nevertheless, it is possible to define\ncomputation relative to a `classical oracle'. Then, we show there exists a\nclassical oracle relative to which efficient computation in any theory\nsatisfying the causality assumption and tomographic locality does not include\nNP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 16:13:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 18:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-14"}

There are as of yet no\nexamples of such planets with masses > 6 Earth masses: All known planets in\nthis mass regime have lower densities requiring significant fractions of\nvolatiles or H/He gas. We also constrain the mass and period of the outer\ncompanion in the Kepler-93 system from the long-term radial velocity trend and\narchival adaptive optics images.

Spintronics, is one of the promising directions for the\nPost-CMOS era. While the potential of spintronic memories is relatively well\nknown, realizing logic remains an open and critical challenge. All Spin Logic\n(ASL) is a recently proposed logic style that realizes Boolean logic using\nspin-transfer-torque (STT) devices based on the principle of non-local spin\ntorque. ASL has advantages such as density, non-volatility, and low operating\nvoltage. However, it also suffers from drawbacks such as low speed and static\npower dissipation. Recent work has shown that, in the context of simple\narithmetic circuits (adders, multipliers), the efficiency of ASL can be greatly\nimproved using techniques that utilize its unique characteristics. An\nevaluation of ASL across a broad range of circuits, considering the known\noptimization techniques, is an important next step in determining its\nviability. In this work, we propose a systematic methodology for the synthesis\nof ASL circuits. Our methodology performs various optimizations that benefit\nASL, such as intra-cycle power gating, stacking of ASL nanomagnets, and\nfine-grained logic pipelining. We utilize the proposed methodology to evaluate\nthe suitability of ASL implementations for a wide range of benchmarks viz.\nrandom combinational and sequential logic, digital signal processing circuits,\nand the Leon SPARC3 general-purpose processor. Based on our evaluation, we\nidentify (i) the large current requirement of nanomagnets at fast switching\nspeeds, (ii) the static power dissipation in the all-metallic devices, and\n(iii) the short spin flip length in interconnects as key bottlenecks that limit\nthe competitiveness of ASL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 17:06:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 16:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Simulations with the Toy Model\nillustrate four regimes with respect to an insider threat: under-regulated,\npossibly optimal, tipping-point, and over-regulated. These regimes depend up\nthe number of rules (N) and the minimum latitude (Lmin) required by a normal\nindividual to carry out their activities.

The complete phase diagram, in terms of disorder strength,\nsource pumping and non-linearity, consists of four different optical regimes:\nincoherent fluorescence, standard mode locking, random lasing and the novel\nspontaneous phase locking. A replica symmetry breaking phase transition is\npredicted at the random lasing threshold.

A joint UE\nselection and power allocation method for a multi-cell scenario is presented,\nwhere a hybrid scheduling policy assigns FD timeslots when it provides a\nthroughput advantage by pairing UEs with appropriate power levels to mitigate\nthe mutual interference, but otherwise defaults to HD operation.

In order to achieve this aim we consider the Yukawa interaction\nterm between the fermions and the tachyonic condensate scalar field\nMF(T)barPsiPsi in the action and analyze four different cases corresponding to\ndistinct tachyonic functions F(T(w)). The only condition that this function\nmust satisfy in order to yield 4D chiral fermions upon dimensional reduction is\nto be odd in the extra dimension w. These functions lead to a different\nstructure of the respective fermionic mass spectrum. In particular,\nlocalization of the massless left-chiral fermion zero mode is possible for\nthree of these cases. We further analyze the phenomenology of the Yukawa\ninteraction among fermion fields and gauge bosons localized on the brane and\nobtain the crucial and necessary information to compute the corrections to\nCoulomb's law coming from massive KK vector modes in the non-relativistic\nlimit. These corrections are exponentially suppressed due to the presence of\nthe mass gap in the mass spectrum of the bulk gauge vector field. From our\nresults we conclude that corrections to Coulomb's law in the thin brane limit\nhave the same form (up to a numerical factor) as far as the left-chiral\nmassless fermion field is localized on the brane. Finally we compute the\ncorrections to the Coulomb's law for a more general case, on a thick brane\nscenario, for which we can do estimates consistent with brane phenomenology,\ni.e. we found that the predicted corrections to the Coulomb law in our model,\nwhich are well bounded by the observed experimental photon mass, is far beyond\nits upper bound, positively testing the viability of our tachyonic braneworld.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 17:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

A variety of\nsymmetry breaking sectors are studied, with a focus on the constraints placed\non model parameters by the lightest neutral CP even Higgs boson mass $M_h$. The\nbreaking of $SU(2)_R$ symmetry is achieved by Higgs fields transforming either\nas triplets or doublets, and the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by\neither bi--doublets or doublets. The Higgs potential is analyzed with or\nwithout a gauge singlet Higgs field present. Seesaw models of Type I and Type\nII, inverse seesaw models, universal seesaw models and an $E_6$ inspired\nalternate left--right model are included in our analysis. Several of these\nmodels lead to the tree--level relation $M_h \\leq \\sqrt{2}\\,m_W$ (rather than\n$M_h \\leq m_Z$ that arises in the MSSM), realized when the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry\nbreaking scale is of order TeV.

It also preserves efficiency in the sense that the worst\ncase efficiency loss is less than 30\\% compared to the square-loss-based\nde-biased Lasso estimator. In many cases our estimator is close to or better\nthan the latter, especially when the noise is heavy-tailed. Our de-biasing\nprocedure does not require solving the $L_1$-penalized composite quantile\nregression. Instead, it allows for any first-stage estimator with desired\nconvergence rate and empirical sparsity. The paper also provides new proof\ntechniques for developing theoretical guarantees of inferential procedures with\nnon-smooth loss functions. To establish the main results, we exploit the local\ncurvature of the conditional expectation of composite quantile loss and apply\nempirical process theories to control the difference between empirical\nquantities and their conditional expectations. Our results are established\nunder weaker assumptions compared to existing work on inference for\nhigh-dimensional quantile regression. Furthermore, we consider a\nhigh-dimensional simultaneous test for the regression parameters by applying\nthe Gaussian approximation and multiplier bootstrap theories. We also study\ndistributed learning and exploit the divide-and-conquer estimator to reduce\ncomputation complexity when the sample size is massive. Finally, we provide\nempirical results to verify the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 18:44:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 03:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

Consider the world of\nfinance.

An\ninformation Hamiltonian is considered and an additional Hamiltonian is\npresented which reflects the dynamics of selling/buying shares between traders.\nAn important result of the paper is that when the information Hamiltonian is\nzero, portfolio operators commute with the Hamiltonian and this suggests that\nthe dynamics are really due to the information. Under the assumption that the\ninteraction and information terms in the Hamiltonian have similar strength, a\nperturbation scheme is considered on the interaction parameter. Contrary to\nintuition, the paper shows that up to a second order in the interaction\nparameter, a key factor in the computation of the portfolios of traders will be\nthe initial values of the loss of information (rather than the initial\nconditions on the cash and shares). Finally, the paper shows that a natural\noutcome from the inequality of the variation of the portfolio of trader one\nversus the variation of the portfolio of trader two, begs for the introduction\nof `good' and `bad' information.

One kind of nonreversible Markov\nchain is constructed from the reversible ones by enlarging the state space and\nby modifying and adding extra transition rates to create non-reversible moves.\nBecause of the augmentation of the state space, such chains are often referred\nto as lifted Markov Chains. We illustrate the use of lifted Markov chains for\nefficient sampling for several examples. The examples include sampling on a\nring, sampling on a torus, the Ising model on a complete graph, and the\none-dimensional Ising model. We also provide a pseudocode implementation,\nreview related work, and discuss the applicability of such methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 20:48:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 07:16:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2016 23:22:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 16:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

The supernova must predate the 1983 VLA radio\ndetection of the object. We suggest examination of archival images of M83 to\nsearch for evidence of the supernova event that gave rise to this object, and\nthus provide a precise age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 22:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Microservers have recently emerged as an\nalternative to high-end servers, promising scalable performance and low energy\nconsumption in datacenters via scale-out. Unfortunately, stark differences in\narchitectural features, form factor and design considerations make a fair\ncomparison between servers and microservers exceptionally challenging. In this\npaper we present a rigorous methodology and new metrics for fair comparison of\nserver and microserver platforms. We deploy our methodology and metrics to\ncompare a microserver with ARM cores against two servers with x86 cores,\nrunning the same real-time financial analytics workload. We define\nworkload-specific but platform-independent performance metrics for platform\ncomparison, targeting both datacenter operators and end users. Our methodology\nestablishes that a server based the Xeon Phi processor delivers the highest\nperformance and energy-efficiency. However, by scaling out energy-efficient\nmicroservers, we achieve competitive or better energy-efficiency than a\npower-equivalent server with two Sandy Bridge sockets despite the microserver's\nslower cores. Using a new iso-QoS (iso-Quality of Service) metric, we find that\nthe ARM microserver scales enough to meet market throughput demand, i.e. a 100%\nQoS in terms of timely option pricing, with as little as 55% of the energy\nconsumed by the Sandy Bridge server.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 23:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-05"}

To conduct model\nselection in QR, it is important to maintain the hierarchical model structure\nbetween main effects and interaction effects. Existing regularization methods\ngenerally achieve this goal by solving complex optimization problems, which\nusually demands high computational cost and hence are not feasible for high\ndimensional data. This paper focuses on scalable regularization methods for\nmodel selection in high dimensional QR. We first consider two-stage\nregularization methods and establish theoretical properties of the two-stage\nLASSO. Then, a new regularization method, called Regularization Algorithm under\nMarginality Principle (RAMP), is proposed to compute a hierarchy-preserving\nregularization solution path efficiently. Both methods are further extended to\nsolve generalized QR models. Numerical results are also shown to demonstrate\nperformance of the methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 00:06:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 19:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-15"}

Linearly polarized waves are\ngenerated through curvature radiation by relativistic particles streaming along\ncurved magnetic field lines, which have ordinary mode (O-mode) and\nextra-ordinary mode (X-mode) components. As emitted waves propagate outwards,\ntwo mode components are separated due to re- fraction of the O mode, and their\npolarization states are also modified. According to the radius to frequency\nmapping, low frequency emission is generated from higher magnetosphere, where\nsignificant rotation effect leads the X and O modes to be sepa- rated. Hence,\nthe low frequency radiation has a large fraction of linear polarization. As the\nfrequency increases, emission is generated from lower heights, where the\nrotation effect becomes weaker and the distribution regions of two modes are\nmore overlapped. Hence, more significant depolarization appears for emission at\nhigher frequencies. In addition, refraction effect of the O mode becomes\nserious in very deep magnetosphere, which bends the O mode emission towards\nouter parts of a pulsar beam and also causes the separation of mode\ndistribution regions and hence the fractional linear polariza- tion increasing\nwith frequency. If emission of different frequencies is generated from a region\nof the same height, serious O mode refraction can result in the decrease of\nboth profile width and fractional linear polarization. The observed frequency\ndependence of linear polarization for some pulsars can be naturally explained\nwithin the scope of our scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 02:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

A sum logarithmic user rate maximization problem is investigated\nconsidering wireless backhauling constraints.

Various decision\nfusion techniques have been used in order to improve the recognition rate. The\nproposed system has been tested on the FERET, HP, and Bosphorus face databases.\nThe proposed system is compared with conventional and thestate-of-the-art\ntechniques. The recognition rates obtained using FVF approach for FERET\ndatabase is 99.78% compared with 79.60% and 68.80% for conventional gray scale\nLBP and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) based face recognition techniques\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 10:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-06"}

For the larger portion of the\nthesis we study the N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in the planar limit, a\nrecurring topic being the Konishi anomalous dimension, which is roughly the\nanalogue for the mass of the proton in quantum chromodynamics. The N=4\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is known to be integrable in the planar limit,\nwhich opens up a wealth of techniques one can employ in order to find results\nin this limit valid at any value of the coupling. We begin with perturbation\ntheory where the integrability of the theory first manifests itself. Here we\nshowcase the first exact result, the so-called slope function, which is the\nlinear small spin expansion coefficient of the generalized Konishi anomalous\ndimension. We then move on to exact results mainly achieved using the novel\nquantum spectral curve approach, the method allowing one to find scaling\ndimensions of operators at arbitrary values of the coupling. As an example we\nfind the second coefficient in the small spin expansion after the slope, which\nwe call the curvature function. This allows us to extract non-trivial\ninformation about the Konishi operator. Methods of integrability are also\napplicable to other supersymmetric gauge theories such as ABJM, which in fact\nshares many similarities with N=4 super Yang-Mills.

Low frequency (nanoHz) GWs are detectable through long-term\ntiming observations of the most stable pulsars. Radio observatories worldwide\nare currently carrying out observing programmes to detect GWs, with data sets\nbeing shared through the International Pulsar Timing Array project. One of the\nmost likely sources of low frequency GWs are supermassive black hole binaries\n(SMBHBs), detectable as a background due to a large number of binaries, or as\ncontinuous or burst emission from individual sources. No GW signal has yet been\ndetected, but stringent constraints are already being placed on galaxy\nevolution models. The SKA will bring this research to fruition.\n  In this chapter, we describe how timing observations using SKA1 will\ncontribute to detecting GWs, or can confirm a detection if a first signal\nalready has been identified when SKA1 commences observations. We describe how\nSKA observations will identify the source(s) of a GW signal, search for\nanisotropies in the background, improve models of galaxy evolution, test\ntheories of gravity, and characterise the early inspiral phase of a SMBHB\nsystem.\n  We describe the impact of the large number of millisecond pulsars to be\ndiscovered by the SKA; and the observing cadence, observation durations, and\ninstrumentation required to reach the necessary sensitivity. We describe the\nnoise processes that will influence the achievable precision with the SKA. We\nassume a long-term timing programme using the SKA1-MID array and consider the\nimplications of modifications to the current design. We describe the possible\nbenefits from observations using SKA1-LOW. Finally, we describe GW detection\nprospects with SKA1 and SKA2, and end with a description of the expectations of\nGW astronomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 12:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-05"}

This so-called confinement phenomenon is responsible for $98\\%$ of the\nmass in the visible universe. The measurement of the hadron excitation spectra\ntherefore gives valuable input for theory and phenomenology to quantitatively\nunderstand this phenomenon. One simple model to describe hadrons is the\nConstituent Quark Model (CQM), which knows two types of hadrons: mesons,\nconsisting of a quark and an antiquark, and baryons, which are made out of\nthree quarks. More advanced models, which are inspired by QCD as well as\ncalculations within Lattice QCD predict the existence of other types of\nhadrons, which may be e.g. described solely by gluonic excitations (glueballs)\nor mixed quark and gluon excitations (hybrids). In order to search for such\nstates, the COMPASS experiment at the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN has\ncollected large data sets, which allow to study the light-quark meson and\nbaryon spectra in unmatched precision. The overview shown here focuses on the\nlight meson sector, presenting a detailed Partial-Wave Analysis of the\nprocesses: $\\pi^- p \\to \\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^- p$ and $\\pi^-p\\to \\pi^-\\pi^0\\pi^0p$.

In the same analysis, a signal in a wave\nwith $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ is observed. A resonant origin of this signal would not be\nexplicable within the CQM. In addition to this possibility of an exotic state,\na possible non resonant origin of this signal is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 13:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-07"}

The proposed model\ncan be used to study the evolution of network depicted by different topics on\nthe web correlated by a dynamic \"fluid\" of tags among them. The fluid-dynamic\nmodel depicted is completely evolutive, thus it is able to describe the dynamic\nsituation of a network at every instant of time. This overcomes the\ndifficulties encountered by many static models. The theory permits the\ndevelopment of efficient numerical schemes also for very large networks. This\nis possible since dynamic flow at junctions is modeled in a simple and\ncomputationally convenient way (resorting to a linear programming problem). The\nobtained model consists of a single conservation law and is on one side simple\nenough to permit a complete understanding, on the other side reach enough to\ndetect the evolution of the dynamic network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 14:36:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-05"}

The large size in TAZ and\naggregated information of macroscopic simulation underestimate the real\nevacuation performance. To take advantage of the high resolution demographic\ndata LandScan USA (the zone size is much smaller than TAZ) and agent-based\nmicroscopic traffic simulation models, many new problems appeared and novel\nsolutions are needed. A series of studies are conducted using LandScan USA\nPopulation Cells (LPC) data for evacuation assignments with different network\nconfigurations, travel demand models, and travelers compliance behavior.\n  First, a new Multiple Source Nearest Destination Shortest Path (MSNDSP)\nproblem is defined for generating Origin Destination matrix in evacuation\nassignments when using LandScan dataset. Second, a new agent-based traffic\nassignment framework using LandScan and TRANSIMS modules is proposed for\nevacuation planning and operation study. Impact analysis on traffic analysis\narea resolutions (TAZ vs LPC), evacuation start times (daytime vs nighttime),\nand departure time choice models (normal S shape model vs location based model)\nare studied. Third, based on the proposed framework, multi-scale network\nconfigurations (two levels of road networks and two scales of zone sizes) and\nthree routing schemes (shortest network distance, highway biased, and shortest\nstraight-line distance routes) are implemented for the evacuation performance\ncomparison studies. Fourth, to study the impact of human behavior under\nevacuation operations, travelers compliance behavior with compliance levels\nfrom total complied to total non-complied are analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 19:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

It is often equated with rationality of choice\nand is considered useful in building rankings. Intransitive preferences are\nconsidered paradoxical and undesirable. This problem is discussed by many\nsocial and natural sciences. The paper discusses a simple model of sequential\ngame in which two players in each iteration of the game choose one of the two\nelements. They make their decisions in different contexts defined by the rules\nof the game. It appears that the optimal strategy of one of the players can\nonly be intransitive! (the so-called \\textsl{relevant intransitive\nstrategies}.) On the other hand, the optimal strategy for the second player can\nbe either transitive or intransitive. A quantum model of the game using pure\none-qubit strategies is considered. In this model, an increase in importance of\nintransitive strategies is observed -- there is a certain course of the game\nwhere intransitive strategies are the only optimal strategies for both players.\nThe study of decision-making models using quantum information theory tools may\nshed some new light on the understanding of mechanisms that drive the formation\nof types of preferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 16:16:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 08:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}
