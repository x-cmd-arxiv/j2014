The\nsecond is the fairly familiar inhomogeneous nonlinear complex Ginzburg--Landau\n(CGL) equation. The two-level model is exactly solvable for the nonlinear\nglobal mode and its stability, while for the spatially-extended CGL equation,\nperturbative solutions for the global mode and its stability are presented,\nvalid for inhomogeneities with arbitrary scales of spatial variation and global\nmodes of small amplitude, corresponding to a scenario near criticality. For\nother scenarios, a numerical iterative nonlinear eigenvalue technique is\npreferred. Two global modes of different amplitudes are revealed in the\nnumerical approach. For both the two-level system and the nonlinear CGL\nequation, the analytical calculations are supplemented with direct numerical\nsimulation, thus showing the fate of unstable global modes.

For the\nspatially-extended CGL model in the subcritical regime, the global mode of\nlarger amplitude exhibits a `one-sided' instability leading to a chaotic\ndynamics, while the global mode of smaller amplitude is always unstable (theory\nconfirms this).

It has been shown that different spatial\nconfigurations of the sources lead to different energy spectra and composition\nprofiles (in the case of sources injecting heavy nuclei) at Earth. These\nensemble fluctuations are more important at the highest energies because only\nnearby sources, which are necessarily few, can contribute to the flux observed\nat Earth.

From\nthe analysis of the looping-unlooping rates and the looping probabilities of\nthe chain ends we show that the presence of small crowders typically slow down\nthe chain dynamics but larger crowders may in fact facilitate the looping. We\nrationalise these non-trivial and often counterintuitive effects of the crowder\nsize onto the looping kinetics in terms of an effective solution viscosity and\nstandard excluded volume effects. Thus for small crowders the effect of an\nincreased viscosity dominates, while for big crowders we argue that confinement\neffects (caging) prevail. The tradeoff between both trends can thus result in\nthe impediment or facilitation of polymer looping, depending on the crowder\nsize. We also examine how the crowding volume fraction, chain length, and the\nattraction strength of the contact groups of the polymer chain affect the\nlooping kinetics and hairpin formation dynamics. Our results are relevant for\nDNA looping in the absence and presence of protein mediation, DNA hairpin\nformation, RNA folding, and the folding of polypeptide chains under\nbiologically relevant high-crowding conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2014 19:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

We also study the corresponding computation\nin Toda theory and find that this provides yet another independent way to\narrive at the same result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2014 20:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-09"}

Further, spatial\npooling layers in the convolutional architecture reduce the dimensionality\nwithout losing excessive information. By employing the proposed temporal\nconvolutional architecture with spatial pooling, raw input fMRI data is mapped\nto a non-linear, highly-expressive and low-dimensional feature space where the\nfinal classification is conducted.

This could become a serious issue as one considers\ndeeper and more non-linear functions, e.g., consider the extreme case of\nnonlinearity where the relation between parameters and cost is actually\ndiscrete. Inspired by the biological implausibility of back-propagation, a few\napproaches have been proposed in the past that could play a similar credit\nassignment role. In this spirit, we explore a novel approach to credit\nassignment in deep networks that we call target propagation. The main idea is\nto compute targets rather than gradients, at each layer. Like gradients, they\nare propagated backwards. In a way that is related but different from\npreviously proposed proxies for back-propagation which rely on a backwards\nnetwork with symmetric weights, target propagation relies on auto-encoders at\neach layer. Unlike back-propagation, it can be applied even when units exchange\nstochastic bits rather than real numbers. We show that a linear correction for\nthe imperfectness of the auto-encoders, called difference target propagation,\nis very effective to make target propagation actually work, leading to results\ncomparable to back-propagation for deep networks with discrete and continuous\nunits and denoising auto-encoders and achieving state of the art for stochastic\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2014 20:57:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 16:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Apr 2015 01:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2015 07:05:40 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2015 02:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-26"}

In particular we analyze its asymptotic\nbehaviour in the double-scaling limit in which both the representation labels\nand the Chern-Simons coupling are taken to be large, but with fixed ratio. When\nthe Wilson graph operator has a specific form, motivated by loop quantum\ngravity, the critical point equations obtained in this double-scaling limit\ndescribe a very specific class of flat connection on the graph complement\nmanifold. We find that flat connections in this class are in correspondence\nwith the geometries of constant curvature 4-simplices. The result is fully\nnon-perturbative from the perspective of the reconstructed geometry. We also\nshow that the asymptotic behavior of the amplitude contains at the leading\norder an oscillatory part proportional to the Regge action for the single\n4-simplex in the presence of a cosmological constant. In particular, the\ncosmological term contains the full-fledged curved volume of the 4-simplex.\nInterestingly, the volume term stems from the asymptotics of the Chern-Simons\naction. This can be understood as arising from the relation between\nChern-Simons theory on the boundary of a region, and a theory defined by an\n$F^2$ action in the bulk. Another peculiarity of our approach is that the sign\nof the curvature of the reconstructed geometry, and hence of the cosmological\nconstant in the Regge action, is not fixed a priori, but rather emerges\nsemiclassically and dynamically from the solution of the equations of motion.\nIn other words, this work suggests a relation between 4-dimensional loop\nquantum gravity with a cosmological constant and SL(2,C) Chern-Simons theory in\n3-dimensions with knotted graph defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2014 21:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-10"}

The microscopic Auger\nprocesses can be either direct or indirect, mediated by an additional\nscattering mechanism such as the electron-phonon interaction. Phonon-assisted\nAuger recombination is particularly strong in nitride materials and affects the\nefficiency of nitride optoelectronic devices at high powers. Here we present a\nfirst-principles computational formalism for the study of direct and indirect\nAuger recombination in direct-band-gap semiconductors and apply it to the case\nof nitride materials. We show that direct Auger recombination is weak in the\nnitrides and cannot account for experimental measurements. On the other hand,\ncarrier scattering by phonons and alloy disorder enables indirect Auger\nprocesses that can explain the observed loss in devices. We analyze the\ndominant phonon contributions to the Auger recom- bination rate and the\ninfluence of temperature and strain on the values of the Auger coefficients.\nAuger processes assisted by charged-defect scattering are much weaker than the\nphonon-assisted ones for realistic defect densities and not important for the\ndevice performance. The computational formalism is general and can be applied\nto the calculation of the Auger coefficient in other classes of optoelectronic\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2014 21:40:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 13:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-11"}

These spot pair events are\n{\\it not} particle pair events -- they are the sudden creation or annihilation\nof a pair of relatively illuminated spots on a scattering surface. Real spot\npair illumination events occur unambiguously on the scattering surface when\nspot speeds diverge, while virtual spot pair events are observer dependent and\nperceived only when real spot radial speeds cross the speed of light.\nSpecifically, a virtual spot pair creation event will be observed when a real\nspot's speed toward the observer drops below $c$, while a virtual spot pair\nannihilation event will be observed when a real spot's radial speed away from\nthe observer rises above $c$. Superluminal spot pair events might be found\nangularly, photometrically, or polarimetrically, and might carry useful\ngeometry or distance information.

These \"cold\" exoplanets have atmospheric\nenvironments conducive for the formation of water and/or ammonia clouds, like\nJupiter in the Solar System. We study the science return from direct-imaging\nexoplanet missions, focusing on the exoplanet atmospheric compositions. First,\nthe study shows that a low-resolution (R=70) reflection spectrum of a giant\nexoplanet at 600 - 1000 nm, for a moderate signal-to-noise ratio of 20, will\nallow measurements of both the pressure of the uppermost cloud deck and the\nmixing ratio of methane, if the uppermost cloud deck is located at the pressure\nlevel of 0.6 - 1.5 bars. Further increasing the signal-to-noise ratio can\nimprove the measurement range of the cloud deck pressure to 0.2 - 4 bars. The\nstrong and the weak absorption bands of methane allow the simultaneous\nmeasurements of cloud and gas; when the uppermost cloud deck is located\nshallower than the pressure level of 0.2, the weak bands are muted, and the\ncloud deck pressure and the mixing ratio of methane are not distinguishable\nfrom a single reflection spectrum. Second, future direct-imaging exoplanet\nmissions may detect the broadband reflectivity of a few super-Earth exoplanets.\nIf having H2O-dominated atmospheres, directly imaged super Earths are likely to\nhave water clouds located shallower than 1E-3 bars.

I generalize these results in two ways. First, I show\nthat SWAP is only one in a large family of gates that uplift matchgates to\nquantum universality. In fact, I show that the set of all matchgates plus any\nnonmatchgate parity-preserving two-qubit gate is universal, and interpret this\nfact in terms of local invariants of two-qubit gates. Second, I investigate the\npower of matchgates in arbitrary connectivity graphs, showing they are\nuniversal on any connected graph other than a path or a cycle, and classically\nsimulable on a cycle. I also prove the same dichotomy for the XY interaction.\n  Free bosons give rise to a model known as BosonSampling. BosonSampling\nconsists of (i) preparing a Fock state of n photons, (ii) interfering these\nphotons in an m-mode linear interferometer, and (iii) measuring the output in\nthe Fock basis. Sampling approximately from the resulting distribution should\nbe classically hard, under reasonable complexity assumptions. Here I show that\nexact BosonSampling remains hard even if the linear-optical circuit has\nconstant depth. I also report several experiments where three-photon\ninterference was observed in integrated interferometers of various sizes,\nproviding some of the first implementations of BosonSampling in this regime.\nThe experiments also focus on the bosonic bunching behavior and on validation\nof BosonSampling devices.

At the initial stage of the OCS this context is associated,\nin the general case, with two sources of particles located on the different\nsides of the barrier; and at the final stage it is associated, in the general\ncase, with two particle detectors located on different sides of the barrier.\nThe role of a superselection operator is played by the Pauli matrix $\\sigma_3$\nthat divides the space of in- and out-asymptotes into two coherent sectors. In\nthe course of the OCS, its unitary quantum dynamics crosses these sectors. In\nparticular, in the scattering problem with one source and two detectors, a pure\ninitial state of a particle is converted into a mixed final state. According to\nthis rule, the OCS is a complex quantum process consisting of two coherent\nsubprocesses -- transmission and reflection; the average value of any\nobservable as well as characteristic times can be defined for the subprocesses\nonly.

We have\nconsidered a first accretion mode where AGN activity is triggered by disk\ninstabilities (DI) in isolated galaxies, and a second feeding mode where such\nan activity is triggered by galaxy mergers and fly-by events (interactions,\nIT). We obtained the following results:i) for hosts with $M_* \\lesssim 10^{11}\nM_{\\bigodot}$, both DI and IT modes are able to account for the observed AGN\nhosts stellar mass function; for more massive hosts, the DI scenario predicts a\nlower space density than the IT model, lying below the observational estimates\nfor z>0.8.ii) The analysis of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of AGN hosts\nfor redshift z < 1.5 can provide a good observational test to effectively\ndiscriminate between the DI and IT mode, since DIs are expected to yield AGN\nhost galaxy colors skewed towards bluer colors, while in the IT scenario the\nmajority of hosts are expected to reside in the red sequence.iii) While both IT\nand DI scenarios can account for AGN triggered in main sequence or starburst\ngalaxies, DIs fail in triggering AGN activity in passive galaxies.iv) The two\nmodes are characterized by a different duration of the AGN phase, with DIs\nlasting even on time scales $\\sim $ Gyr, much longer with respect to the IT\nscenario.v) The scatter of the $SFR-L_{bol}$ relation could represent another\ncrucial diagnostics to discriminate between the two triggering modes, since the\nDI scenario predicts an appreciably lower scatter of the relation than the IT\nscenario. vi) Disk instabilities are not able to account for the observed\nfraction of AGN in groups for z < 1 and clusters for z < 0.7, while the IT\nscenario provides a good match to observational data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2014 13:28:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2015 14:31:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 11:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-24"}

In addition, we\nmake two assumptions, easily justifiable. The first is that the mass-accretion\nrate to the black hole in a BHT outburst has a generic bell-shaped form. This\nis guaranteed by the observational fact that all BHTs start their outburst and\nend it at the quiescent state. The second assumption is that at low accretion\nrates the accretion flow is geometrically thick, ADAF-like, while at high\naccretion rates it is geometrically thin.\n  Results: Both, at the beginning and the end of an outburst, the PRCB\nestablishes a strong poloidal magnetic field in the ADAF-like part of the\naccretion flow, and this explains naturally why a jet is always present in the\nright part of the HLD. In the left part of the HLD, the accretion flow is in\nthe form of a thin disk, and such a disk cannot sustain a strong poloidal\nmagnetic filed. Thus, no jet is expected in this part of the HLD. The\ncounterclockwise traversal of the HLD is explained as follows: the poloidal\nmagnetic field in the ADAF forces the flow to remain ADAF and the source to\nmove upwards in the HLD rather than to turn left. Thus, the history of the\nsystem determines the counterclockwise traversal of the HLD. As a result, no\nBHT is expected to ever traverse the entire HLD curve in the clockwise\ndirection.\n  Conclusions: We offer a physical interpretation of accretion and ejection in\nBHTs with only one parameter, the mass transfer rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2014 13:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We find that fractional instantons have more general\ncomposite structures, that is, a global vortex with an Ising spin (or a\nhalf-lump vortex), a half sine-Gordon kink on a domain wall, or a half lump on\na \"space-filling brane\" in the $O(3)$ model (${\\mathbb C}P^1$ model) on\n${\\mathbb R}^{1} \\times S^1$, and a global monopole with an Ising spin (or a\nhalf-Skyrmion monopole), a half sine-Gordon kink on a global vortex, a half\nlump on a domain wall, or a half Skyrmion on a \"space-filling brane\" in the\n$O(4)$ model (principal chiral model or Skyrme model) on ${\\mathbb R}^{2}\n\\times S^1$.

For providing survivability in\nEONs, we consider a recently proposed survivability method for conventional\nfixed grid networks, known as pre-configured backup protection with sharing\n(PBPS), because of its benefits over the traditional survivability approaches\nsuch as dedicated and shared protection. In PBPS, backup paths can be\npre-configured and at the same time they can share resources. Therefore, both\nshort recovery time and efficient resource usage can be achieved. We find that\nthe existing switch architectures do not support both PBPS and EONs.\nSpecifically, we identify and illustrate that, if a switch architecture is not\ncarefully designed, several key problems/issues might arise in certain\nscenarios.

The interstellar wind blows the two jets into the tail\nbut is not strong enough to force the lobes into a single comet-like tail, as\nhappens to some astrophysical jets (Morsony et al. 2013). Instead, the\ninterstellar wind flows around the heliosphere and into equatorial region\nbetween the two jets.
