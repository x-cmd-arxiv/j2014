In order to generate mass for\nthe Standard Model fermions, we consider extended gauge dynamics, effectively\nrepresented by four fermion interactions at presently accessible energies. By\nsystematically treating these interactions, we show that they lead to a large\nreduction of the mass of the scalar resonance.

In contrast to previous works on subspace-based data representations,\nthis paper focuses on the geometric structure of a union of subspaces (UoS). In\nthis regard, it proposes a distributed algorithm---termed cloud K-SVD---for\ncollaborative learning of a UoS structure underlying distributed data of\ninterest. The goal of cloud K-SVD is to learn a common overcomplete dictionary\nat each individual site such that every sample in the distributed data can be\nrepresented through a small number of atoms of the learned dictionary. Cloud\nK-SVD accomplishes this goal without requiring exchange of individual samples\nbetween sites. This makes it suitable for applications where sharing of raw\ndata is discouraged due to either privacy concerns or large volumes of data.\nThis paper also provides an analysis of cloud K-SVD that gives insights into\nits properties as well as deviations of the dictionaries learned at individual\nsites from a centralized solution in terms of different measures of\nlocal/global data and topology of interconnections.

It does not include collapse, and it does not consider the environment.\nIt is assumed that a discrete degenerate or non-degenerate observable is\nmeasured. Premeasurement is defined by the calibration condition, which\nrequires that every initially statistically sharp value of the measured\nobservable has to be detected with statistical certainty by the measuring\ninstrument. The entire theory is derived as a logical consequence of this\ndefinition using the standard quantum formalism. The study has a comprehensive\ncoverage, hence the article is actually a topical review. Connection is made\nwith results of other authors, particularly with basic works on premeasurement.\nThe article is a conceptual review, not a historical one. General exact\npremeasurement is defined in 7 equivalent ways. Nondemolition premeasurement,\ndefined by requiring preservation of any sharp value of the measured\nobservable, is characterized in 10 equivalent ways. Overmeasurement, i. e., a\nprocess in which the observable is measured on account of being a function of a\nfiner observable that is actually measured, is discussed. Disentangled\npremeasurement, in which, by definition, to each result corresponds only one\npointer-observable state in the final composite-system state, is investigated.\nIdeal premeasurement, a special case of both nondemolition premeasurement and\ndisentangled premeasurement, is defined, and its most important properties are\ndiscussed. Finally, disentangled and entangled premeasurements, in conjunction\nwith nondemolition or demolition premeasurements, are used for classification\nof all premeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Dec 2014 20:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

Therefore,\nthe image can be reconstructed using many sparse recovery algorithms such as\nthe basis pursuit. The bound on the required number of masks is linear in\nsparsity of the image but it is logarithmic in its dimension.

First, we\npoint out that the \"cut and paste\" construction does not guarantee a\nwell-defined manifold because there is no overlap of coordinates across the\nshell. When one requires that the spacetime metric across the thin shell is\ncontinuous, it also provides a way to specify the tangent space and the\nmanifold. Other authors have shown that this specification leads to the\nconservation laws when shells collide. On the other hand, the well-known areal\nradius $r$ seems to be a perfect coordinate covering all regions of a\nspherically symmetric spacetime. However, we show by simple but rigorous\narguments that $r$ fails to be a coordinate covering a neighborhood of the thin\nshell if the metric across the shell is continuous. When two spherical shells\ncollide and merge into one, we show that it is possible that $r$ remains to be\na good coordinate and the conservation laws hold. To make this happen,\ndifferent spacetime regions divided by the shells must be glued in a specific\nway such that some constraints are satisfied.

Using 2-D axisymmetric hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we study superbubbles created by overlapping supernovae in OB\nassociations. We calculate the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the\ncenter of the disk along different angles through the superbubble and the gas\ndisk. After convolving with the luminosity function of OB associations, we show\nthat the ionizing photons escape within a cone of $\\sim 40 ^\\circ$, consistent\nwith observations of nearby galaxies. The evolution of the escape fraction with\ntime shows that it falls initially as cold gas is accumulated in a dense shell.\nAfter the shell crosses a few scale heights and fragments, the escape fraction\nthrough the polar regions rises again. The angle-averaged escape fraction\ncannot exceed $\\sim [1- \\cos (1 \\, {\\rm radian})] = 0.5$ from geometrical\nconsiderations (using the emission cone opening angle). We calculate the\ndependence of the time- and angle-averaged escape fraction on the mid-plane\ndisk gas density (in the range $n_0=0.15-50$ cm $^{-3}$) and the disk scale\nheight (between $z_0=10-600$ pc).

Our full domain decomposition approach extends our\nprevious work for the potential equation only, and we present perspectives on\nits HPC implementation. The model can be used, e.g., for the design of higher\nefficiency solar cells for which experimental results are not available. More\ngenerally, our algorithm is naturally parallelizable and is a new domain\ndecomposition paradigm for problems with multiscale phenomena associated with\ninternal interfaces and/or boundary layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Dec 2014 15:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

Huge amounts of experimental data of the\nmultipion photoproduction have been accumulated, and more can be expected in\nthe future in facilities such as JLab 12 GeV. It makes it possible to\ninvestigate the decay of a nucleon resonance into another nucleon resonance.\nPurpose: The possibility to research the decay of the $N(2120)$ to nucleon\nresonances near 1.7 GeV in the three-pion photoproduction will be explored to\nprovide useful information for future experimental study. Method: The pion and\nradiative decay amplitudes of nucleon resonances are studied within the\nconstituent quark model, which is used to calculate the couplings constants,\nespecially for the decay of a nucleon resonance near 2.1 GeV to another nucleon\nresonance near 1.7 GeV. The three-pion photoproduction off the neutron target,\ni.e.,$\\gamma n \\to\\pi^{-}\\pi^{-}\\Delta^{++}\\to \\pi^{-}\\pi^{-}\\pi^+ p$, is\ninvestigated based on the effective Lagrangian method with the coupling\nconstant obtained form the decay amplitudes. Results: The resonance\ncontribution with a state $N(^2P_M)\\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ near 2.1 GeV decaying to a\nstate $N(^4P_M)\\frac{5}{2}^{-}$ near 1.7 GeV, i.\\ e., $N(2120)\\to N(1675)\\pi$\nis dominant in the process considered. The total cross section from the\nresonance contribution is at the order of 1 $\\mu$b and can be easily\ndistinguished from the background. Conclusions: Our results suggest it is\npracticable to research the decay of the $N(2120)$ to the $N(1675)$ in\nexperiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Dec 2014 15:34:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2015 14:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-21"}

These NC corrections\nalter the nature of the measurement interaction, as a noiseless interaction may\nacquire noise, and an interaction of independent intervention may become\ndependent of the object system. However the most striking result is that\nnoncommutativity may lead to a violation of the OUP itself. The NC corrections\nfor the Backaction Evading Quadrature Amplifier reveal a new term which may\npotentially be amplified in such a way that the violation of the OUP becomes\nexperimentally testable. On the other hand, the NC corrections to the Noiseless\nQuadrature Transducer shows an incompatibility of this model with NC quantum\nmechanics.
