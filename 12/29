At a mesoscopic scale only the\nenergies of the macroscopic bodies are accessible together with the\nconfigurations of the contact system. We consider a class of models where the\ncontact system, as well as macroscopic bodies, have a finite number of possible\nconfigurations. The global system with only discrete degrees of freedom has no\nmicroscopic Hamiltonian dynamics, but it is shown that, if the microscopic\ndynamics is assumed to be deterministic and ergodic and to conserve energy\naccording to some specific pattern, and if the mesoscopic evolution of the\nglobal system is approximated by a Markov process as closely as possible, then\nthe mesoscopic transition rates obey three constraints. In the limit where\nmacroscopic bodies can be considered as reservoirs at thermodynamic equilibrium\n(but with different intensive parameters) the mesoscopic transition rates turn\ninto transition rates for the contact system and the third constraint becomes\nlocal detailed balance ; the latter is generically expressed in terms of the\nmicroscopic exchange entropy variation, namely the opposite of the variation of\nthe thermodynamic entropy of the reservoir involved in a given microscopic jump\nof the contact system configuration. For a finite-time evolution after contact\nhas been switched on we derive a fluctuation relation for the joint probability\nof the heat amounts received from the various reservoirs. The generalization to\nsystems exchanging energy, volume and matter with several reservoirs, with a\npossible conservative external force acting on the contact system, is given\nexplicitly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Dec 2014 16:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

We focus on the relation of position and altitude of noise\nstorms with the observing frequency and on the lower limit of their sizes. We\npresent results for noise storms on four days. The results consist of an\nextended halo and of one or several compact cores with relative intensity\nchanging over a few seconds. We found that core sizes can be almost stable over\none hour, with a minimum in the range 31-35 arcsec (less than previously\nreported) and can be stable over one hour. The heliocentric distances of noise\nstorms are $\\sim 1.20$ and 1.35 $R_{\\odot}$ at 432 and 150 MHz, respectively.\nRegions where storms originate are thus much denser than the ambient corona and\ntheir vertical extent is found to be less than expected from hydrostatic\nequilibrium. The smallest observed sizes impose upper limits on broadening\neffects due to scattering on density inhomogeneities in the low and medium\ncorona and constrain the level of density turbulence in the solar corona. It is\npossible that scatter broadening has been overestimated in the past, and that\nthe observed sizes cannot only be attributed to scattering.

Focusing the study to the\nlarge and small cosmic time $t$ limits, we were able to find which $F(R)$\ngravities can generate the matter bounce Hubble parameter. In the case of small\ncosmic time limit, which corresponds to large curvature values, the $F(R)$\ngravity is $F(R)\\sim R+\\alpha R^2$, which is an inflation generating gravity,\nand at small curvature, or equivalently, large cosmic time, the $F(R)$ gravity\ngenerating the corresponding limit of the matter bounce Hubble parameter, is\n$F(R)\\sim \\frac{1}{R}$, a gravity known to produce late-time acceleration.

It involves an electronic\ncontrol of the driving voltages used for an electrochemical etching of a gold\nwire in an HCl-glycerol mixture or an HCl solution. We find that a stopping\ncurrent, below which the circuit is set to shut off, is a single very important\nparameter to produce an Au tip of desired shape. We present detailed\ndescriptions for a two-step etching process for Au tips and also test results\nfrom PCS measurements using them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Dec 2014 19:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-04"}

First, we use dimensional analysis to show that phase\ncurves are controlled by six nondimensional parameters. Second, we use an\nidealized general circulation model (GCM) to explore the relative sensitivity\nof phase curves to these parameters. We find that the feature of phase curves\nmost sensitive to atmospheric parameters is the peak-to-trough amplitude.\nMoreover, except for hot and rapidly rotating planets, the phase amplitude is\nprimarily sensitive to only two nondimensional parameters: 1) the ratio of\ndynamical to radiative timescales, and 2) the longwave optical depth at the\nsurface. As an application of this technique, we show how phase curve\nmeasurements can be combined with transit or emission spectroscopy to yield a\nnew constraint for the surface pressure and atmospheric mass of terrestrial\nplanets. We estimate that a single broadband phase curve, measured over half an\norbit with the James Webb Space Telescope, could meaningfully constrain the\natmospheric mass of a nearby super-Earth.

The\ntransition matrix of a \"Hopf-power Markov chain\" is (the transpose of) the\nmatrix of the coproduct-then-product operator on a combinatorial Hopf algebra\nwith respect to a suitable basis. These chains describe the\nbreaking-then-recombining of the combinatorial objects in the Hopf algebra. The\nmotivating example is the famous Gilbert-Shannon-Reeds model of\nriffle-shuffling of a deck of cards, which arises in this manner from the\nshuffle algebra.\n  The primary reason for constructing Hopf-power Markov chains, or for\nrephrasing familiar chains through this lens, is that much information about\nthem comes simply from translating well-known facts on the underlying Hopf\nalgebra. For example, there is an explicit formula for the stationary\ndistribution (Theorem 4.5.1), and constructing quotient algebras show that\ncertain statistics on a Hopf-power Markov chain are themselves Markov chains\n(Theorem 4.7.1). Perhaps the pinnacle is Theorem 2.5.1, a collection of\nalgorithms for a full left and right eigenbasis in many common cases where the\nunderlying Hopf algebra is commutative or cocommutative. This arises from a\ncocktail of the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem, the Cartier-Milnor-Moore\ntheorem, Reutenauer's structure theory of the free Lie algebra, and Patras's\nEulerian idempotent theory.\n  Since Hopf-power Markov chains can exhibit very different behaviour depending\non the structure of the underlying Hopf algebra and its distinguished basis,\none must restrict attention to certain styles of Hopf algebras in order to\nobtain stronger results. This thesis will focus respectively on a\nfree-commutative basis, which produces \"independent breaking\" chains, and a\ncofree basis; there will be both general statements and in-depth examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Dec 2014 23:04:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 02:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-05"}

For narrowband\ndirectional spectra, the formulation is given by a sixfold integral that\ndepends upon the Benjamin-Feir index and the parameter\n$R=\\sigma_{\\theta}^{2}/2\\nu^{2}$, a measure of short-crestedness for the\ndominant waves with $\\nu$ and $\\sigma_{\\theta}$} denoting spectral bandwidth\nand angular spreading. Our refinement leads to a new analytical solution for\nthe dynamic kurtosis of narrowband directional waves described with a Gaussian\ntype spectrum. For multidirectional or short-crested seas initially homogenous\nand Gaussian, in a focusing (defocusing) regime dynamic kurtosis grows\ninitially, attaining a positive maximum (negative minimum) at the intrinsic\ntime scale \\[\n\\tau_{c}=\\nu^{2}\\omega_{0}t_{c}=1/\\sqrt{3R},\\qquad\\mathrm{or}\\qquad\nt_{c}/T_{0}\\approx0.13/\\nu\\sigma_{\\theta}, \\] where $\\omega_{0}=2\\pi/T_{0}$\ndenotes the dominant angular frequency. Eventually the dynamic excess kurtosis\ntends monotonically to zero as the wave field reaches a quasi-equilibrium state\ncharacterized with nonlinearities mainly due to bound harmonics. Quasi-resonant\ninteractions are dominant only in unidirectional or long-crested seas where the\nlonger-time dynamic kurtosis can be larger than that induced by bound\nharmonics, especially as the Benjamin-Feir index increases.

It is shown in the recent work [7] by using explicit Jacobi\nelliptic functions that the cubic NLS equation on a tadpole graph admits a rich\nstructure of standing waves. Among these, there are different branches of\nlocalized waves bifurcating from the edge of the essential spectrum of an\nassociated Schr\\\"odinger operator. We show by using a modified Lyapunov-Schmidt\nreduction method that the bifur- cation of localized standing waves occurs for\nevery positive power nonlinearity. We distinguish a primary branch of never\nvanishing standing waves bifurcating from the trivial solution and an infinite\nsequence of higher branches with oscillating behavior in the ring. The higher\nbranches bifurcate from the branches of degenerate standing waves with\nvanishing tail outside the ring. Moreover, we analyze stability of bifurcating\nstanding waves. Namely, we show that the primary branch is composed by\norbitally stable standing waves for subcritical power nonlinearities, while all\nnontrivial higher branches are linearly unstable near the bifurcation point.\nThe stability character of the degenerate branches remains inconclusive at the\nanalytical level, whereas heuristic arguments based on analysis of embedded\neigenvalues of negative Krein signatures support the conjecture of their linear\ninstability at least near the bifurcation point. Numerical results for the\ncubic NLS equation show that this conjecture is valid and that the degenerate\nbranches become spectrally stable far away from the bifurcation point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Dec 2014 23:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

We consider relative crossed products $C^*(A,\\alpha;J)$ where\n$J$ is an ideal in $A$, and describe up to Morita-Rieffel equivalence all gauge\ninvariant ideals in $C^*(A,\\alpha;J)$ and give six term exact sequences\ndetermining their $K$-theory. We also obtain certain criteria implying that all\nideals in $C^*(A,\\alpha;J)$ are gauge invariant, and that $C^*(A,\\alpha;J)$ is\npurely infinite.\n  In the second part, we consider a situation where $A$ is a $C_0(X)$-algebra\nand $\\alpha$ is such that $\\alpha(f a)=\\Phi(f)\\alpha(a)$, $a\\in A$, $f\\in\nC_0(X)$ where $\\Phi$ is an endomorphism of $C_0(X)$. Pictorially speaking,\n$\\alpha$ is a mixture of a topological dynamical system $(X,\\varphi)$ dual to\n$(C_0(X),\\Phi)$ and a continuous field of homomorphisms $\\alpha_x$ between the\nfibers $A(x)$, $x\\in X$, of the corresponding $C^*$-bundle.\n  For systems described above, we establish efficient conditions for the\nuniqueness property, gauge-invariance of all ideals, and pure infiniteness of\n$C^*(A,\\alpha;J)$. We apply these results to the case when $X=$Prim$(A)$ is a\nHausdorff space. In particular, if the associated $C^*$-bundle is trivial, we\nobtain formulas for $K$-groups of all ideals in $C^*(A,\\alpha;J)$. In this way,\nwe constitute a large class of crossed products whose ideal structure and\n$K$-theory is completely described in terms of $(X,\\varphi,\\{\\alpha_{x}\\}_{x\\in\nX};Y)$ where $Y$ is a closed subset of $X$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2014 01:54:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 16:46:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2016 16:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}

More than half\n(34 stars) of these 50 target superflare stars show no evidence of binarity,\nand we estimated stellar parameters of these 34 stars in our previous study\n(Notsu et al. 2015, hereafter called Paper I).

In this study, we investigated whether these\nquasi-periodic brightness variations of superflare stars are explained by the\nrotation of a star with fairly large starspots, by using stellar parameters\nderived in Paper I. First, we confirmed that the value of the projected\nrotational velocity $v \\sin i$ is consistent with the rotational velocity\nestimated from the period of the brightness variation. Next, we measured the\nintensity of Ca II infrared triplet lines and H$\\alpha$ line, good indicators\nof the stellar chromospheric activity, and compared them with other stellar\nproperties. The intensity of Ca II infrared triplet lines indicates that the\nmean magnetic field strength ($\\langle fB\\rangle$) of the target superflare\nstars can be higher than that of the Sun. A correlation between the amplitude\nof the brightness variation and the intensity of Ca II triplet line was found.\nAll the targets expected to have large starspots because of their large\namplitude of the brightness variation show high chromospheric activities\ncompared to the Sun.

Pulsations were clearly detected in the X-ray light\ncurves at a barycentric period of 41.2852 s which suggests that the pulsar is\nspinning-up. The pulse profiles were found to be peculiar e.g. unlike that\nobtained from the earlier Suzaku observation on 2007 May 14. A single-peaked\nnarrow profile at soft X-rays (0.5-10 keV range) changed to a double-peaked\nbroad profile in 12-55 keV energy range and again reverted back to a smooth\nsingle-peaked profile at hard X-rays (55-70 keV range). The 1.0-100.0 keV\nbroad-band spectrum of the pulsar was found to be well described by three\ncontinuum models such as (i) a partial covering high energy cut-off power-law\nmodel, (ii) a partially absorbed power-law with high-energy exponential rolloff\nand (iii) a partial covering Negative and Positive power law with EXponential\n(NPEX) continuum model. Unlike earlier Suzaku observation during which several\nlow energy emission lines were detected, a weak and narrow Iron K_alpha\nemission line at 6.4 keV was only present in the pulsar spectrum during the\n2012 May outburst. Non-detection of any absorption like feature in 1-100 keV\nenergy range supports the claim of absence of cyclotron resonance scattering\nfeature in EXO 2030+375 from earlier Suzaku observation. Pulse-phase resolved\nspectroscopy revealed the presence of additional dense matter causing the\nabsence of second peak from the soft X-ray pulse profiles.

All the earlier\nmodel predictions are too large compared with experiment. In this work, we\npoint out that for a given tree operator $O_i$, the contribution from its\nFiertz transformed operator, an effect often missed in the literature, tends to\ncancel the internal $W$-emission amplitude induced from $O_i$. The wave\nfunction of low-lying baryons are symmetric in momenta and the quark flavor\nwith the same chirality, but antisymmetric in color indices. Using these\nsymmetry properties and the chiral structure of weak interactions, we find that\nhalf of the Feynman diagrams responsible for internal $W$-emission cancel.\nSince this feature holds in the charmless modes but not in the charmful ones,\nwe advocate that the partial cancellation accounts for the smallness of the\ntree-dominated charmless two-body baryonic $B$ decays. This also explains why\nmost previous model calculations predicted too large rates as the above\nconsideration was not taken into account. Finally, we emphasize that, contrary\nto the claim in the literature, the internal $W$-emission tree amplitude should\nbe proportional to the Wilson coefficient $c_1+c_2$ rather than $c_1-c_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2014 07:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

In type II (resp. III)\nwormholes the radial and transverse pressures are asymptotically proportional\nand die out faster (resp. slower) than the energy density. We introduce a novel\nand generalizable method for deriving, with no cutoff in the stress-energy or\ngluing, a class of each of the three wormhole types.

When a statistical quantity was\nneeded it was obtained from a spatial, temporal or ensemble average of sample\nrealizations of the turbulence. However, there are important advantages to\nstudying the dynamics of the statistical state (the SSD) directly. In highly\nchaotic systems statistical quantities are often the most useful and the\nadvantage of obtaining these statistics directly from a state variable is\nobvious. Moreover, quantities such as the probability density function (pdf)\nare often difficult to obtain accurately by sampling state trajectories even if\nthe pdf is stationary. In the event that the pdf is time dependent, solving\ndirectly for the pdf as a state variable is the only alternative. However,\nperhaps the greatest advantage of the SSD approach is conceptual: adopting this\nperspective reveals directly the essential cooperative mechanisms among the\ndisparate spatial and temporal scales that underly the turbulent state. While\nthese cooperative mechanisms have distinct manifestation in the dynamics of\nrealizations of turbulence both these cooperative mechanisms and the phenomena\nassociated with them are not amenable to analysis directly through study of\nrealizations as they are through the study of the associated SSD.

For example, deep convolutional networks are\nbecoming the default option for difficult tasks on large datasets, such as\nimage and speech recognition. However, here we show that error rates below 1%\non the MNIST handwritten digit benchmark can be replicated with shallow\nnon-convolutional neural networks. This is achieved by training such networks\nusing the 'Extreme Learning Machine' (ELM) approach, which also enables a very\nrapid training time (~10 minutes). Adding distortions, as is common practise\nfor MNIST, reduces error rates even further. Our methods are also shown to be\ncapable of achieving less than 5.5% error rates on the NORB image database. To\nachieve these results, we introduce several enhancements to the standard ELM\nalgorithm, which individually and in combination can significantly improve\nperformance. The main innovation is to ensure each hidden-unit operates only on\na randomly sized and positioned patch of each image. This form of random\n`receptive field' sampling of the input ensures the input weight matrix is\nsparse, with about 90% of weights equal to zero. Furthermore, combining our\nmethods with a small number of iterations of a single-batch backpropagation\nmethod can significantly reduce the number of hidden-units required to achieve\na particular performance. Our close to state-of-the-art results for MNIST and\nNORB suggest that the ease of use and accuracy of the ELM algorithm for\ndesigning a single-hidden-layer neural network classifier should cause it to be\ngiven greater consideration either as a standalone method for simpler problems,\nor as the final classification stage in deep neural networks applied to more\ndifficult problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2014 11:14:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 08:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The focus lies\non an observer O interrogating a system S with binary questions and S's state\nis taken as O's `catalogue of knowledge' about S. The mathematical tools of the\nframework are simple and we attempt to highlight all underlying assumptions.\nFour rules are imposed, asserting (1) a limit on the amount of information\navailable to O; (2) the mere existence of complementary information; (3) O's\ntotal amount of information to be preserved in-between interrogations; and, (4)\nO's `catalogue of knowledge' to change continuously in time in-between\ninterrogations and every consistent such evolution to be possible. This\napproach permits a constructive derivation of quantum theory, elucidating how\nthe ensuing independence, complementarity and compatibility structure of O's\nquestions matches that of projective measurements in quantum theory, how\nentanglement and monogamy of entanglement, non-locality and, more generally,\nhow the correlation structure of arbitrarily many qubits and rebits arises. The\nrules yield a reversible time evolution and a quadratic measure, quantifying\nO's information about S. Finally, it is shown that the four rules admit two\nsolutions for the simplest case of a single elementary system: the Bloch ball\nand disc as state spaces for a qubit and rebit, respectively, together with\ntheir symmetries as time evolution groups. The reconstruction for arbitrarily\nmany qubits is completed in a companion paper (arXiv:1511.01130) where an\nadditional rule eliminates the rebit case. This approach is inspired by (but\ndoes not rely on) the relational interpretation and yields a novel formulation\nof quantum theory in terms of questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2014 12:46:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2015 20:13:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 12:17:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2016 16:52:04 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 17:54:24 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 15:35:06 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 18:53:28 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 16:39:38 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 18:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

A hydrodynamic\nanalogy of a similar type has recently come under criticism by Richardson et\nal., because despite striking similarities at a phenomenological level the\ngoverning equations related to the force on the particle are evidently\ndifferent for the hydrodynamic and the quantum descriptions, respectively.\nHowever, said differences are not relevant if a radically different use of said\nanalogy is being made, thereby essentially referring to emergent processes in\nour model. If the latter are taken into account, one can show that the forces\non the particles are identical in both the dBB and our model. In particular,\nthis identity results from an exact matching of our emergent velocity field\nwith the Bohmian \"guiding equation\". One thus arrives at an explanation\ninvolving a deeper, i.e. subquantum, level of the dBB version of quantum\nmechanics. We show in particular how the classically-local approach of the\nusual hydrodynamical modeling can be overcome and how, as a consequence, the\nconfiguration-space version of dBB theory for $N$ particles can be completely\nsubstituted by a \"superclassical\" emergent dynamics of $N$ particles in real\n3-dimensional space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2014 14:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-20"}

Usually, their efficiency and correctness are analyzed\nusing probabilistic tools under the assumption that the inputs and queries are\nindependent of the internal randomness of the data structure. In this work, we\nconsider data structures in a more robust model, which we call the adversarial\nmodel. Roughly speaking, this model allows an adversary to choose inputs and\nqueries adaptively according to previous responses. Specifically, we consider a\ndata structure known as \"Bloom filter\" and prove a tight connection between\nBloom filters in this model and cryptography.\n  A Bloom filter represents a set $S$ of elements approximately, by using fewer\nbits than a precise representation. The price for succinctness is allowing some\nerrors: for any $x \\in S$ it should always answer `Yes', and for any $x \\notin\nS$ it should answer `Yes' only with small probability.\n  In the adversarial model, we consider both efficient adversaries (that run in\npolynomial time) and computationally unbounded adversaries that are only\nbounded in the number of queries they can make.

Amid the\nconfusions, the possibility that black hole evaporation stops with a \"remnant\"\nhas remained unpopular and is often dismissed due to some \"undesired\nproperties\" of such an object. Nevertheless, as in any scientific debate, the\npros and cons of any proposal must be carefully scrutinized. We fill in the\nvoid of the literature by providing a timely review of various types of black\nhole remnants, and provide some new thoughts regarding the challenges that\nblack hole remnants face in the context of the information loss paradox and its\nlatest incarnation, namely the firewall controversy. The importance of\nunderstanding the role of curvature singularity is also emphasized, after all\nthere remains a possibility that the singularity cannot be cured even by\nquantum gravity. In this context a black hole remnant conveniently serves as a\ncosmic censor. We conclude that a remnant remains a possible end state of\nHawking evaporation, and if it contains large interior geometry, may help to\nameliorate the information loss paradox and the firewall controversy. We hope\nthat this will raise some interests in the community to investigate remnants\nmore critically but also more thoroughly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2014 15:12:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 22:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2015 14:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-01"}

These patterns exist in domains of any size, and\nappear to derive their stability from a constructive reinforcement effect of\nthe standing waves that surround any feature. There are several common elements\n- including a spot that behaves as a quasiparticle, a U-shaped stripe, and a\nring or annulus, or a portion thereof - which combine to form a great variety\nof stable structures. These patterns interact with each other in a variety of\nways. There are similarities to other reaction-diffusion systems and to\nphysical experiments; I offer several suggestions for further research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2014 00:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-12"}

The main results can be split into three parts. The\nresults of the first part guarantee that each \"unit distance graph\" in the\nplane has an induced subgraph with chromatic number at most 4 that covers at\nleast 91.7 percent of the vertices of the whole graph.\n  The results of the second and third parts are related to the standard model\nof a random graph with n labeled vertices in which the edges occur\nindependently with probability p, where p is a function of n. This is known as\nthe Erdos--Renyi model G(n,p). Given a monotone property of a graph, Erdos and\nRenyi's theorem (1960) states that there exists a critical threshold value of\np(n) below which the probability that a random graph has that property tends to\none (as n tends to infinity) and above which the probability tends to zero.\n  The main results of the second part are concerned with the (monotone)\nproperty of a graph to be isomorphic to some unit-distance graph in Euclidean\nd-space with fixed dimension d. The results of this part guarantee that for d\nin {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, the threshold value of p(n) is big-Theta of 1/n.\nFurthermore, the case d = 1 stands apart from the case of higher dimensions;\nhere the threshold probability is big-Theta of 1/(n^(4/3)).\n  The results of the third part are devoted to studying \"graphs of diameters\"\nfrom the probabilistic standpoint. In particular, it is shown that under some\nconditions, almost all graphs of diameters in the plane have chromatic number\nless than 3. More generally, it is shown for G(n,p) that graphs of diameters\nhave a tendency to chromatic degeneration (for large n) when p is close to 0,\nbut have a tendency to completeness when p is close to 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2014 05:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-16"}
