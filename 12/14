Reciprocity, defined for a digraph as\nthe percentage of edges with a reciprocal edge, is a key metric that has been\nused in the literature to compare different directed networks and provide\n\"hints\" about their structural properties: for example, are reciprocal edges\ngenerated randomly by chance or are there other processes driving their\ngeneration? In this paper we study the problem of maximizing achievable\nreciprocity for an ensemble of digraphs with the same prescribed in- and\nout-degree sequences. We show that the maximum reciprocity hinges crucially on\nthe in- and out-degree sequences, which may be intuitively interpreted as\nconstraints on some \"social capacities\" of nodes and impose fundamental limits\non achievable reciprocity. We show that it is NP-complete to decide the\nachievability of a simple upper bound on maximum reciprocity, and provide\nconditions for achieving it. We demonstrate that many real networks exhibit\nreciprocities surprisingly close to the upper bound, which implies that users\nin these social networks are in a sense more \"social\" than suggested by the\nempirical reciprocity alone in that they are more willing to reciprocate,\nsubject to their \"social capacity\" constraints. We find some surprising linear\nrelationships between empirical reciprocity and the bound. We also show that a\nparticular type of small network motifs that we call 3-paths are the major\nsource of loss in reciprocity for real networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 00:44:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 16:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Many\nSGB operators that extend SQL have been proposed in the literature, e.g.,\nsimilarity operators in the one-dimensional space. These operators have various\nsemantics. Depending on how these operators are implemented, some of the\nimplementations may lead to different groupings of the data. Hence, if SQL code\nis ported from one database system to another, it is not guaranteed that the\ncode will produce the same results. In this paper, we investigate the various\nsemantics for the relational similarity group-by operators in the\nmulti-dimensional space. We define the class of order-independent SGB operators\nthat produce the same results regardless of the order in which the input data\nis presented to them. Using the notion of interval graphs borrowed from graph\ntheory, we prove that, for certain SGB operators, there exist order-independent\nimplementations. For each of these operators, we provide a sample algorithm\nthat is order-independent. Also, we prove that for other SGB operators, there\ndoes not exist an order-independent implementation for them, and hence these\nSGB operators are ill-defined and should not be adopted in extensions to SQL to\nrealize similarity group-by. In this paper, we introduce an SGB operator,\nnamely SGB-All, for grouping multi-dimensional data using similarity. SGB-All\nforms groups such that a data item, say O, belongs to a group, say G, if and\nonly if O is within a user-defined threshold from all other data items in G. In\nother words, each group in SGB-All forms a clique of nearby data items in the\nmulti-dimensional space. We prove that SGB-All are order-independent, i.e.,\nthere is at least one algorithm for each option that is independent of the\npresentation order of the input data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 01:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}

This theory has a mass gap that is\nproportional to the topological mass $m$. Thus, Yang-Mills contribution decays\nexponentially at very large distances compared to $1/m$, leaving a pure\nChern-Simons theory with level number $k$. The focus of this research is the\n$near$ Chern-Simons limit of the theory, where the distance is large enough to\ngive an almost topological theory, with a small contribution from the\nYang-Mills term. It is shown that this almost topological theory consists of\ntwo copies of Chern-Simons with level number $k/2$, very similar to the\nChern-Simons splitting of topologically massive AdS gravity model. As $m$\napproaches to infinity, the split parts add up to give the original\nChern-Simons term with level $k$. Also, gauge invariance of the split\nChern-Simons theories is discussed for odd values of $k$. Furthermore, a\nrelation between the observables of topologically massive Yang-Mills theory and\nChern-Simons theory is obtained. It is shown that one of the two split\nChern-Simons pieces is associated with Wilson loops while the other with 't\nHooft loops. This allows one to use skein relations to calculate topologically\nmassive Yang-Mills theory observables in the near Chern-Simons limit. Finally,\nmotivated with the topologically massive AdS gravity model, Chern-Simons\nsplitting concept is extended to pure Yang-Mills theory at large distances. It\nis shown that pure Yang-Mills theory acts like two Chern-Simons theories with\nlevel numbers $k/2$ and $-k/2$ at large scales. At very large scales, these two\nterms cancel to make the theory trivial, as required by the existence of a mass\ngap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 04:10:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 01:47:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2018 04:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-18"}

We proove certain properties of this update: roughly, in the case\nof LPs and when the \"constraint activity\" does not change between iterations,\nthe KKT conditions hold after just one iteration. This gives essential insight\non when the method is efficient in practise. We then present our main\ncontribution, which are consistent any-time (non-central) updates of the dual\nparameters (i.e., updating the dual parameters when we are not currently at an\nextremum of the Lagrangian). Similar to the primal-dual Newton method, this\nleads to an algorithm that parallely updates the primal and dual solutions, not\ndistinguishing between an outer loop to adapt the dual parameters and an inner\nloop to minimize the Lagrangian. We again proof certain properties of this\nanytime update: roughly, in the case of LPs and when constraint activities\nwould not change, the dual solution converges after one iteration. Again, this\ngives essential insight in the caveats of the method: if constraint activities\nchange the method may destablize. We propose simple smoothing, step-size\nadaptation and regularization mechanisms to counteract this effect and\nguarantee monotone convergence. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on\nrandom LPs as well as on standard robot trajectory optimization problems,\nconfirming our motivation and intuition that our approach performs well if the\nproblem structure implies moderate stability of constraint activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 09:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}

I begin to consider the secular changes induced in galactic\nsystems by such presumed variations, assumed adiabatic. It is important to\nunderstand these effects, in isolation from other evolutionary influences, in\norder to identify or constrain a0 variations by detection of induced effects,\nor lack thereof. I find that as long as the system is fully in the deep-MOND\nregime -- as applies to many galactic systems -- the adiabatic response of the\nsystem obeys simple scaling laws. For example, in a system that would be\nstationary for fixed a0, the system expands homologously as a0^{-1/4}, while\ninternal velocities decrease uniformly as a0^{1/4}. If a0 is proportional to cH\nat all relevant times, this change amounts to a factor of ~ 2.5 since redshift\n10. For a system stationary in a rotating frame, the angular frequency\ndecreases as a0^{1/2}. The accelerations increase relative to a0 as a0^{-1/4},\npushing the system towards the Newtonian regime. All this follows from the\nappearance of a0 in MOND and the scale invariance of the deep-MOND limit -- two\nbasic tenets of MOND. More complicated evolution ensues when parts of the\nsystem become Newtonian, or are so from inception. For example, these parts may\nbecome unstable, not being protected by MOND's stabilizing effects. The\nexistence of such regions also modifies the MONDian regime, since they affect\nthe potential everywhere, and since constituents might migrate between the\nNewtonian and MONDian regimes.

We provide two novel approximations that substantially\nreduce the computational cost of evaluating the information matrix by complete\nenumeration of response outcomes, or Monte Carlo approximations thereof: (i) an\nasymptotic approximation which is accurate when there is strong dependence\nbetween observations in the same block; (ii) an approximation via Kriging\ninterpolators.

Furthermore, the combined process of scattering and transfer\nalong curved ray path makes the problem more complex. In this paper, a Monte\nCarlo method is presented to simulate polarized radiative transfer in\ngradient-index media that only support planar ray trajectories. The ray\nequation is solved to the second order to address the effect induced by curved\nray trajectories. Three types of test cases are presented to verify the\nperformance of the method, which include transparent medium, Mie scattering\nmedium with assumed gradient index distribution, and Rayleigh scattering with\nrealistic atmosphere refractive index profile.

A\ncomparison of the early shock-cooling components in the observed light curves\nwith the UV continuum levels which we assume trace the strength of CSM\ninteraction suggests that events with slower cooling have stronger CSM\nemission. The radio emission from events having a prominent UV excess is\nperhaps consistent with slower blast-wave velocities, as expected if the\nexplosion shock was slowed down by the CSM that is also responsible for the\nstrong UV, but this connection is currently speculative as it is based on only\na few events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 19:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The advanced waves, which travel\nbackward in time, are difficult to visualize and although they are\nmathematically allowed by relativistic wave equations, they never really caught\non. The HN theory reduced to Einstein's theory of gravity in the smooth fluid\napproximation and a transformation into the rest frame of the fluid.\nUnfortunately the theory has been ignored by much of the General Relativity\ncommunity since it was developed with the static universe in mind. However, it\nis easy to drop the static universe condition (by dropping the \"C\"-field matter\ncreation terms) and then you have a perfectly good theory of gravitation.\nHawking in 1965 pointed out a possible flaw in the theory. This involved\nintegrating out into the distant future to account for all the advanced waves\nwhich might influence the mass of a particle here and now. Hawking used\ninfinity as his upper time limit and showed the integral was divergent. We\nwould like to point out that since the universe is known to be expanding, and\naccelerating, the upper limit in the advanced wave time integral should not be\ninfinite but is bounded by the Cosmic Event Horizon. This event horizon $H_e$\nrepresents a barrier between future events that can be observed and those which\ncannot. We maintain that the advanced integral is in fact finite when the\ncosmic event horizon is taken into account, since the upper limit of the\nadvanced wave integral becomes $H_e/c$.
