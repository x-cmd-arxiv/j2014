The\nsubdiffusion parameters are the same in both parts of the system separated by\nthe membrane. Using the random walk model with discrete time and space\nvariables the probabilities (Green's functions) $P(x,t)$ describing a\nparticle's random walk are found. The membrane, which can be asymmetrical, is\ncharacterized by the two probabilities of stopping a random walker by the\nmembrane when it tries to pass through the membrane in both opposite\ndirections. Green's functions are transformed to the system in which the\nvariables are continuous, and then the membrane permeability coefficients are\ngiven by special formulae which involve the probabilities mentioned above. From\nthe obtained Green's functions, we derive boundary conditions at the membrane.\nOne of the conditions demands the continuity of a flux at the membrane but the\nother one is rather unexpected and contains the Riemann--Liouville fractional\ntime derivative $P(x_N^-,t)=\\lambda_1 P(x_N^+,t)+\\lambda_2 \\partial^{\\alpha/2}\nP(x_N^+,t)/\\partial t^{\\alpha/2}$, where $\\lambda_1$, $\\lambda_2$ depending on\nmembrane permeability coefficients ($\\lambda_1=1$ for a symmetrical membrane),\n$\\alpha$ is a subdiffusion parameter and $x_N$ is the position of the membrane.\nThis boundary condition shows that the additional `memory effect', represented\nby the fractional derivative, is created by the membrane. This effect is also\ncreated by the membrane for a normal diffusion case in which $\\alpha=1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 16:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The current\ncontention mechanism used in IEEE 802.11 networks is called Carrier Sense\nMultiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). It uses a Binary\nExponential Backoff (BEB) technique to randomise each contender attempt of\ntransmitting, effectively reducing the collision probability. Nevertheless,\nCSMA/CA relies on a random backoff that while effective and fully\ndecentralised, in principle is unable to completely eliminate collisions,\ntherefore degrading the network throughput as more contenders attempt to share\nthe channel.\n  To overcome these situations, Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Enhanced\nCollision Avoidance (CSMA/ECA) is able to create a collision-free schedule in a\nfully decentralised manner using a deterministic backoff after successful\ntransmissions. Hysteresis and Fair Share are two extensions of CSMA/ECA to\nsupport a large number of contenders in a collision-free schedule. CSMA/ECA\noffers better throughput than CSMA/CA and short-term throughput fairness. This\nwork describes CSMA/ECA and its extensions.

Based on these\nmeasurements, we have also simulated the excess noise and optimized channel\nallocation for the integration of CV-QKD in some access networks. We have, for\nexample, shown that CV-QKD could coexist with 5 pairs of channels (with nominal\ninput powers: 2dBm forward and 1dBm backward) over a 25km WDM-PON network. The\nobtained results demonstrate the outstanding capacity of CV-QKD to coexist with\nclassical signals of realistic intensity in optical networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 17:10:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 10:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

However, currently predicted escape rates of\nPluto's atmosphere suggest that of order one-half to several kilometers of\nnitrogen ice has been removed from Pluto's surface over geologic time. Because\nthis range of depths is comparable to or greater than most expected crater\ndepths on Pluto, one might expect that many craters on Pluto's surface may have\nbeen removed or degraded by this process, biasing the observed crater SFD\nrelative to the production-function crater SFD. Further, if Pluto's surface\nvolatile layer is comparable to or deeper than crater depths, and if the\nviscosity of this layer surface ice is low like the viscosity of pure N2 ice at\nPluto's measured 35 K surface temperature (or as low as the viscosity of CH4\nice at warmer but plausible temperatures on isolated pure-CH4 surfaces on\nPluto), then craters on Pluto may also have significantly viscously relaxed,\nalso potentially biasing the observed crater SFD and surface crater retention\nage.

Such codes\ncan take as input a high number of uncertain parameters and it is important to\nidentify their influences via a global sensitivity analysis (GSA). However,\nthese codes can be time consuming which prevents a GSA based on the classical\nSobol' indices, requiring too many simulations. This is especially true as the\nnumber of inputs is important. To address this limitation, we consider recent\nadvances in dependence measures, focusing on the distance correlation and the\nHilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Our objective is to study these\nindices and use them for a screening purpose. Numerical tests reveal some\ndifferences between dependence measures and classical Sobol' indices, and\npreliminary answers to \"What sensitivity indices to what situation?\" are\nderived. Then, two approaches are proposed to use the dependence measures for a\nscreening purpose. The first one directly uses these indices with independence\ntests; asymptotic tests and their spectral extensions exist and are detailed.\nFor a higher accuracy in presence of small samples, we propose a non-asymptotic\nversion based on bootstrap sampling. The second approach is based on a linear\nmodel associating two simulations, which explains their output difference as a\nweighed sum of their input differences. From this, a bootstrap method is\nproposed for the selection of the influential inputs. We also propose a\nheuristic approach for the calibration of the HSIC Lasso method. Numerical\nexperiments are performed and show the potential of these approaches for\nscreening when many inputs are not influential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 17:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-04"}

Using the multi-scale convolutional MultiBox (MSC-MultiBox)\napproach, we substantially advance the state-of-the-art on the ILSVRC 2014\ndetection challenge data set, with $0.5$ mAP for a single model and $0.52$ mAP\nfor an ensemble of two models. MSC-Multibox significantly improves the proposal\nquality over its predecessor MultiBox~method: AP increases from $0.42$ to\n$0.53$ for the ILSVRC detection challenge. Finally, we demonstrate improved\nbounding-box recall compared to Multiscale Combinatorial Grouping with less\nproposals on the Microsoft-COCO data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 19:03:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 19:22:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2015 03:41:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-10"}

We first observe that the notoriously difficult problem of learning\nparities with noise can be captured as a special case of learning graphical\nmodels. This leads to an unconditional computational lower bound of $\\Omega\n(p^{d/2})$ for learning general graphical models on $p$ nodes of maximum degree\n$d$, for the class of so-called statistical algorithms recently introduced by\nFeldman et al (2013). The lower bound suggests that the $O(p^d)$ runtime\nrequired to exhaustively search over neighborhoods cannot be significantly\nimproved without restricting the class of models.\n  Aside from structural assumptions on the graph such as it being a tree,\nhypertree, tree-like, etc., many recent papers on structure learning assume\nthat the model has the correlation decay property. Indeed, focusing on\nferromagnetic Ising models, Bento and Montanari (2009) showed that all known\nlow-complexity algorithms fail to learn simple graphs when the interaction\nstrength exceeds a number related to the correlation decay threshold. Our\nsecond set of results gives a class of repelling (antiferromagnetic) models\nthat have the opposite behavior: very strong interaction allows efficient\nlearning in time $O(p^2)$.

We first show that, in the\nabsence of any incentives to cooperate, the optimal strategy for the agents is\nto behave in a selfish manner with each agent seeking the optimal solution\nindependently of the other agents. Pareto inefficiency arises as a result of\nthe fact that agents are not using historical data to predict the behavior of\ntheir neighbors and to know whether they will reciprocate and participate in\nsharing information. Motivated by this observation, we develop a reputation\nprotocol to summarize the opponent's past actions into a reputation score,\nwhich can then be used to form a belief about the opponent's subsequent\nactions. The reputation protocol entices agents to cooperate and turns their\noptimal strategy into an action-choosing strategy that enhances the overall\nsocial benefit of the network.

The classical\nnotion dictates that a star cluster is formed in-situ in a dense molecular gas\nclump followed by a substantial residual gas expulsion. On the other hand,\nbased on the observed morphologies of many young stellar associations, a\nhierarchical formation scenario is alternatively suggested. A very young (age\n$\\approx$ 1 Myr), massive ($>10^4M_\\odot$) star cluster like the Galactic NGC\n3603 young cluster (HD 97950) is an appropriate testbed for distinguishing\nbetween such \"monolithic\" and \"hierarchical\" formation scenarios. A recent\nstudy by Banerjee and Kroupa (2014) demonstrates that the monolithic scenario\nremarkably reproduces the HD 97950 cluster. In the present work, we explore the\npossibility of the formation of the above cluster via hierarchical assembly of\nsubclusters. These subclusters are initially distributed over a wide range of\nspatial volumes and have various modes of sub-clustering. Unlike the monolithic\nmodel that reproduces HD 97950 very well, the same is found to be prohibitive\nwith hierarchical assembly alone. Only those systems which assemble promptly\ninto a single cluster (in $\\lesssim1$ Myr) from a close separation (all within\n$\\lesssim2$ pc) could match the observed density profile of HD 97950 after\n$\\approx70$% gas dispersal. These results therefore suggest that NGC 3603 young\ncluster has formed essentially monolithically, i.e., either in-situ or via a\nprompt assembly, followed by a substantial residual gas expulsion. Both\nscenarios are consistent with the inferred young age and the small age spread\nof this cluster.

In total we test 40 different filters in the General Catalog of\nPhotometric Data as well as those from Tycho-2 and Hipparcos.

MaNGA employs\ndithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary in\ndiameter from 12\" (19 fibers) to 32\" (127 fibers). Two dual-channel\nspectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 A at\nR~2000.

A description of\nnumber scaling and fiber bundles over a flat space time manifold, M, is\nfollowed by a description of gauge theory. A fiber at point x of M contains a\npair of scaled complex number and vector space structures, $C^{c}_{x}\\times\nV^{c}_{x} $ for each c in GL(1,C). A space time dependent scalar field, g,\ndetermines, for each x, the scaling value of the vector space structures that\ncontain the values of a vector valued matter field at x. The vertical\ncomponents of connections between neighboring fibers are taken to be the\ngradient field A(x)+iB(x), of g. Abelian gauge theory for these fields gives\nthe result that B is massless and no mass restrictions for A. Addition of an\nelectromagnetic field dies not change these results. In the Mexican hat Higgs\nmechanism B combines with a Goldstone boson to create massive vector bosons,\nthe photon field, and the Higgs field.

Its main hypothesis\nstates indeed that the classical trajectories of the particles are identical to\nthe sample functions of a diffusion Markov process, whose conditional\nprobability density is proposed as a substitute for the wave function. Along\nthe way, we introduce ad hoc hypotheses for the sole reason that they\nfacilitate and even make possible the further development of the theory. These\nand the so-called Nelson equations are used to determine the drift vectors and\nthe diffusion tensor characteristic of such a process. It is then possible to\nwrite down the Fokker-Planck and Kolmogorov equations that can be used to\ndetermine the normal and conditional probability densities.

We made two independent analyses: one based\nupon identifying the three Cartesian velocity components; and the other based\nupon the cosine dependence of the deviation from Hubble flow on the sky. We\napply these analyses to the Union2.1 SN Ia data and to the SDSS-II supernova\nsurvey. For both methods, results for low redshift, $z < 0.05$, are consistent\nwith previous searches. We find a local bulk flow of $v_{\\rm bf} \\sim 300$ km\ns$^{-1}$ in the direction of $(l,b) \\sim (270, 35)^{\\circ}$. However, the\nsearch for a dark flow at $z>0.05$ is inconclusive. Based upon simulated data\nsets, we deduce that the difficulty in detecting a dark flow at high redshifts\narises mostly from the observational error in the distance modulus. Thus, even\nif it exists, a dark flow is not detectable at large redshift with current SN\nIa data sets. We estimate that a detection would require both significant sky\ncoverage of SN Ia out to $z = 0.3$ and a reduction in the effective distance\nmodulus error from 0.2 mag to $\\lesssim 0.02$ mag.

Here we study the feasibility of measuring\nthe mass of an individual PMO through microlensing by examining a particular\nevent, MOA-2011-BLG-274.

Also, it was intensively monitored from widely separated\nlocations under clear skies at low air masses. Choi et al. (2012) concluded\nthat the lens of the event may have been a PMO but they did not attempt a\nmeasurement of its mass. We report here a re-analysis of the event using\nre-reduced data. We confirm the results of Choi et al. and attempt a\nmeasurement of the mass and distance of the lens using the terrestrial parallax\neffect.

The best fit to the data yields the mass and distance of the lens\nas 0.80 +/- 0.30 M_J and 0.80 +/- 0.25 kpc respectively. We exclude a host star\nto the lens out to a separation ~ 40 AU.

Additionally, the synchrotron-self absorption turn-over\nenergy for low synchrotron energies is calculated, which is inherently\ntime-dependent. It would be challenging to use it to constrain free parameters,\nsince precise knowledge of the observation time relative to the injection time\nis needed. In conclusion, optical depth does not significantly influence the\nnon-linear, time-dependent injection and cooling model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2014 09:46:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Traditionally, IdPs are modeled as trusted third\nparties. This is reasonable for SSO systems like Kerberos, MS Passport and\nSAML, where each SP explicitely specifies which IdP he trusts. However, in open\nsystems like OpenID and OpenID Connect, each user may set up his own IdP, and a\ndiscovery phase is added to the protocol flow. Thus it is easy for an attacker\nto set up its own IdP. In this paper we use a novel approach for analyzing SSO\nauthentication schemes by introducing a malicious IdP. With this approach we\nevaluate one of the most popular and widely deployed SSO protocols - OpenID. We\nfound four novel attack classes on OpenID, which were not covered by previous\nresearch, and show their applicability to real-life implementations. As a\nresult, we were able to compromise 11 out of 16 existing OpenID implementations\nlike Sourceforge, Drupal and ownCloud. We automated discovery of these attacks\nin a open source tool OpenID Attacker, which additionally allows fine-granular\ntesting of all parameters in OpenID implementations. Our research helps to\nbetter understand the message flow in the OpenID protocol, trust assumptions in\nthe different components of the system, and implementation issues in OpenID\ncomponents. It is applicable to other SSO systems like OpenID Connect and SAML.\nAll OpenID implementations have been informed about their vulnerabilities and\nwe supported them in fixing the issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2014 11:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-05"}

In this work we present\nadditional low-resolution spectropolarimetric observations obtained during\nseveral weeks in 2013 December using FORS2 (FOcal Reducer low dispersion\nSpectrograph) mounted at the 8-m Antu telescope of the VLT. These observations\ncover a little less than half of the stellar rotation period of 73.41d\nmentioned in the literature. The behaviour of the mean longitudinal magnetic\nfield is consistent with the assumption of a single-wave variation during the\nstellar rotation cycle, indicating a dominant dipolar contribution to the\nmagnetic field topology. The estimated polar strength of the surface dipole B_d\nis larger than 1.15kG. Further, we compared the behaviour of the line profiles\nof various elements at different rotation phases associated with different\nmagnetic field strengths. The strongest contribution of the emission component\nis observed at the phases when the magnetic field shows a negative or positive\nextremum. The comparison of the spectral behaviour of CPD -28 2561 with that of\nanother Of?p star, HD148937 of similar spectral type, reveals remarkable\ndifferences in the degree of variability between both stars.

Interest in\nmeta-analysis in brain mapping is also driven by a recent focus on so-called\n\"reverse inference\": where as traditional \"forward inference\" identifies the\nregions of the brain involved in a task, a reverse inference identifies the\ncognitive processes that a task engages. Such reverse inferences, however,\nrequire a set of meta-analysis, one for each possible cognitive domain.\nHowever, existing methods for neuroimaging meta-analysis have significant\nlimitations. Commonly used methods for neuroimaging meta-analysis are not model\nbased, do not provide interpretable parameter estimates, and only produce null\nhypothesis inferences; further, they are generally designed for a single group\nof studies and cannot produce reverse inferences. In this work we address these\nlimitations by adopting a nonparametric Bayesian approach for meta-analysis\ndata from multiple classes or types of studies. In particular, foci from each\ntype of study are modeled as a cluster process driven by a random intensity\nfunction that is modeled as a kernel convolution of a gamma random field. The\ntype-specific gamma random fields are linked and modeled as a realization of a\ncommon gamma random field, shared by all types, that induces correlation\nbetween study types and mimics the behavior of a univariate mixed effects\nmodel. We illustrate our model on simulation studies and a meta-analysis of\nfive emotions from 219 studies and check model fit by a posterior predictive\nassessment. In addition, we implement reverse inference by using the model to\npredict study type from a newly presented study.

With its current\nrotational rate, this source is not expected to give pulsed radio emission even\nif the accretion on to the star is hindered by some mechanism.

One important feature in our approach is the\ntransformation of the MBS output into Kinect-output format, thus enabling the\nanalysis of the measurements, obtained from different systems, with the same\nsoftware application, i.e., the one we use in the analysis of Kinect-captured\ndata; one example of such a transformation, for one popular marker-placement\nscheme (`Plug-in Gait'), is detailed. We propose that the similarity of the\noutput, obtained from the different systems, be assessed on the basis of the\ncomparison of a number of waveforms, representing the variation within the gait\ncycle of quantities which are commonly used in the modelling of the human\nmotion.

The alluded growth rate is estimated through the\nvariation in the number of eggs per gram (EPG) of faeces in animals. In\naccordance with earlier studies, our analysis too shows that rainfall is the\ndominant variable in determining EPG infection rates compared to other\nmacro-parameters like temperature and humidity. Our statistical analysis\nclearly indicates an oscillatory dependence of EPG levels on rainfall\nfluctuations. Monsoon recorded the highest infection with a comparative\nincrease of at least 2.5 times compared to the next most infected period\n(summer). A least square fit of the EPG versus rainfall data indicates an\napproach towards a super diffusive (i. e. root mean square displacement growing\nfaster than the square root of the elapsed time as obtained for simple\ndiffusion) infection growth pattern regime for low rainfall regimes\n(technically defined as zeroth level dependence) that gets remarkably augmented\nfor large rainfall zones. Our analysis further indicates that for low\nfluctuations in temperature (true on the bulk data), EPG level saturates beyond\na critical value of the rainfall, a threshold that is expected to indicate the\nonset of the nonlinear regime. The probability density functions (PDFs) of the\nEPG data show oscillatory behavior in the large rainfall regime (greater than\n500 mm), the frequency of oscillation, once again, being determined by the\nambient wetness (rainfall, and humidity). Data recorded over three pilot\nprojects spanning three measures of rainfall and humidity bear testimony to the\nuniversality of this statistical argument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 23:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-08"}

Here we demonstrate that these two methods can be\ncombined and deployed together by means of a new sensitivity bound which\nincorporates the variance of the quantity of interest as well as the Fisher\nInformation Matrix estimated from the first method. The first step of the\nproposed strategy labels sensitivities using the bound and screens out the\ninsensitive parameters in a controlled manner based also on the new sensitivity\nbound. In the second step of the proposed strategy, the finite-difference\nmethod is applied only for the sensitivity estimation of the (potentially)\nsensitive parameters that have not been screened out in the first step. Results\non an epidermal growth factor network with fifty parameters and on a protein\nhomeostasis with eighty parameters demonstrate that the proposed strategy is\nable to quickly discover and discard the insensitive parameters and in the\nremaining potentially sensitive parameters it accurately estimates the\nsensitivities. The new sensitivity strategy can be several times faster than\ncurrent state-of-the-art approaches that test all parameters, especially in\n\"sloppy\" systems. In particular, the computational acceleration is quantified\nby the ratio between the total number of parameters over the number of the\nsensitive parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2014 15:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The purpose of this comment is to show that this expectation has\nnot been met so far. In particular for wall-bounded turbulent flows, the\nprospects for success are not promising in view of the facts we will present\nherein. Although the invariance method of Lie-groups is able to generate\nstatistical scaling laws for wall-bounded turbulent flows, like the log-law for\nexample, these invariant results yet not only fail to fulfil the basic\nrequirements for a first principle result, but also are strongly misleading.\nThe reason is that not the functional structure of the log-law itself is\nmisleading, but that its invariant Lie-group based derivation yielding this\nfunction is what is misleading. By revisiting the study of Oberlack (2001) we\nwill demonstrate that all Lie-group generated scaling laws derived therein do\nnot convince as first principle solutions. Instead, a rigorous derivation\nreveals complete arbitrariness rather than uniqueness in the construction of\ninvariant turbulent scaling laws. Important to note here is that the key\nresults obtained in Oberlack (2001) are based on several technical errors,\nwhich all will be revealed, discussed and corrected. The reason and motivation\nwhy we put our focus solely on Oberlack (2001) is that it still marks the core\nstudy and central reference point when applying the method of Lie-groups to\nturbulence theory. Hence it is necessary to shed the correct light onto that\nstudy. Nevertheless, even if the method of Lie-groups in its full extent is\napplied and interpreted correctly, strong natural limits of this method within\nthe theory of turbulence exist, which, as will be finally discussed, constitute\ninsurmountable obstacles in the progress of achieving a significant\nbreakthrough.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2014 14:34:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 19:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-09"}
