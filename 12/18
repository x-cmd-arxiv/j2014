While many processes can result in discord between gene\ntrees and species trees, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), modeled by the\nmulti-species coalescent, is considered to be a dominant cause for gene tree\nheterogeneity. Coalescent-based methods have been developed to estimate species\ntrees, many of which operate by combining estimated gene trees, and so are\ncalled summary methods. Because summary methods are generally fast, they have\nbecome very popular techniques for estimating species trees from multiple loci.\nHowever, recent studies have established that summary methods can have reduced\naccuracy in the presence of gene tree estimation error, and also that many\nbiological datasets have substantial gene tree estimation error, so that\nsummary methods may not be highly accurate on biologically realistic\nconditions. Mirarab et al. (Science 2014) presented the statistical binning\ntechnique to improve gene tree estimation in multi-locus analyses, and showed\nthat it improved the accuracy of MP-EST, one of the most popular\ncoalescent-based summary methods. Statistical binning, which uses a simple\nstatistical test for combinability and then uses the larger sets of genes to\nre-calculate gene trees, has good empirical performance, but using statistical\nbinning within a phylogenomics pipeline does not have the desirable property of\nbeing statistically consistent. We show that weighting the recalculated gene\ntrees by the bin sizes makes statistical binning statistically consistent under\nthe multispecies coalescent, and maintains the good empirical performance.\nThus, \"weighted statistical binning\" enables highly accurate genome-scale\nspecies tree estimation, and is also statistical consistent under the\nmulti-species coalescent model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 16:02:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 14:45:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 21:10:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 19:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

Such chemical\ndynamic progress can be simulated by stochastic models, particularly the\nGillespie alogrithm.

The\nevaluation of FR-IQA techniques is carried out by comparing the objective\nscores from the techniques with the subjective scores (obtained from human\nobservers) provided in the image databases used for the IQA. Hence, we\nreasonably assume that the goal of a human observer is to rate the distortion\npresent in the test image. The goal oriented tasks are processed by the human\nvisual system (HVS) through top-down processing which actively searches for\nlocal distortions driven by the goal. Therefore local distortion measures in an\nimage are important for the top-down processing. At the same time, bottom-up\nprocessing also takes place signifying spontaneous visual functions in the HVS.\nTo account for this, global perceptual features can be used. Therefore, we\nhypothesize that the resulting objective score for an image can be derived from\nthe combination of local and global distortion measures calculated from the\nreference and test images. We calculate the local distortion by measuring the\nlocal correlation differences from the gradient and contrast information.

Though the literature demonstrates a set of variegated\nvisual cues to detect or evaluate the absence or presence of sharpness, we\nemphasize in the current work that high frequency content and local standard\ndeviation can form strong features to compute perceived sharpness in any\nnatural image, and can be considered an able alternative for the existing cues.\nUnsharp areas in a natural image happen to exhibit uniform intensity or lack of\nsharp changes between regions. Sharp region transitions in an image are caused\nby the presence of spatial high frequency content. Therefore, in the proposed\napproach, we hypothesize that using the high frequency content as the principal\nstimulus, the perceived sharpness can be quantified in an image. When an image\nis convolved with a high pass filter, higher values at any pixel location\nsignify the presence of high frequency content at those locations. Considering\nthese values as the stimulus, the exponent of the stimulus is weighted by local\nstandard deviation to impart the contribution of the local contrast within the\nformation of the sharpness map. The sharpness map highlights the relatively\nsharper regions in the image and is used to calculate the perceived sharpness\nscore of the image. The advantages of the proposed method lie in its use of\nsimple visual cues of high frequency content and local contrast to arrive at\nthe perceptual score, and requiring no training with the images. The promise of\nthe proposed method is demonstrated by its ability to compute perceived\nsharpness for within image and across image sharpness changes and for blind\nevaluation of perceptual degradation resulting due to presence of blur.\nExperiments conducted on several databases demonstrate improved performance of\nthe proposed method over that of the state-of-the-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 17:28:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 02:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-19"}

The core idea is to use continuous transportation to\ntransform typical Metropolis proposal mechanisms (e.g., random walks, Langevin\nmethods) into non-Gaussian proposal distributions that can more effectively\nexplore the target density. Our approach adaptively constructs a lower\ntriangular transport map-an approximation of the Knothe-Rosenblatt\nrearrangement-using information from previous MCMC states, via the solution of\nan optimization problem. This optimization problem is convex regardless of the\nform of the target distribution. It is solved efficiently using a Newton method\nthat requires no gradient information from the target probability distribution;\nthe target distribution is instead represented via samples. Sequential updates\nenable efficient and parallelizable adaptation of the map even for large\nnumbers of samples.

These plateaux limit best possible measurements of the\nnonlinear power at the percent level in a $h^{-3}\\textrm{Gpc}^3$ volume; the\nextraction of model parameters from the spectrum is limited explicitly by their\ndegeneracy to the nonlinear amplitude. The value of the first, super-survey\n(SS) plateau depends on the characteristic survey volume and the large scale\npower; the second, intra-survey (IS) plateau is set by the small scale power.\nWhile both have simple interpretations within the hierarchical \\textit{Ansatz},\nthe SS plateau can be predicted and generalized to still smaller scales within\nTakada and Hu's spectrum response formalism. Finally, the noise knee is\nnaturally set by the density of tracers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 18:29:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2015 13:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

Since the amplitude information of sparse\nsignals in 1-bit CS is not available, it is often the support or the sign of a\nsignal that can be exactly recovered with a decoding method. In this paper, we\nfirst show that a necessary assumption (that has been overlooked in the\nliterature) should be made for some existing theories and discussions for 1-bit\nCS. Without such an assumption, the found solution by some existing decoding\nalgorithms might be inconsistent with 1-bit measurements. This motivates us to\npursue a new direction to develop uniform and nonuniform recovery theories for\n1-bit CS with a new decoding method which always generates a solution\nconsistent with 1-bit measurements. We focus on an extreme case of 1-bit CS, in\nwhich the measurements capture only the sign of the product of a sensing matrix\nand a signal. We show that the 1-bit CS model can be reformulated equivalently\nas an $\\ell_0$-minimization problem with linear constraints. This reformulation\nnaturally leads to a new linear-program-based decoding method, referred to as\nthe 1-bit basis pursuit, which is remarkably different from existing\nformulations. It turns out that the uniqueness condition for the solution of\nthe 1-bit basis pursuit yields the so-called restricted range space property\n(RRSP) of the transposed sensing matrix. This concept provides a basis to\ndevelop sign recovery conditions for sparse signals through 1-bit measurements.\nWe prove that if the sign of a sparse signal can be exactly recovered from\n1-bit measurements with 1-bit basis pursuit, then the sensing matrix must admit\na certain RRSP, and that if the sensing matrix admits a slightly enhanced RRSP,\nthen the sign of a $k$-sparse signal can be exactly recovered with 1-bit basis\npursuit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 18:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 11:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-23"}

We consider\ntwo supernova progenitor masses with homogeneous and clumpy ejecta to assess\nthe chemical type and quantity of dust that forms. Grain size distributions are\nderived as a function of post-explosion time. Methods: The chemistry of the gas\nphase and the simultaneous formation of dust clusters are described by a\nchemical network. The formation of key species (CO, SiO) and dust clusters of\nsilicates, alumina, silica, metal carbides and sulphides, pure metals, and\namorphous carbon is considered. The master equations describing the chemistry\nof the nucleation phase are coupled to a dust condensation formalism based on\nBrownian coagulation. Results: Type II-P supernovae produce dust grains of\nvarious chemical compositions and size distributions as a function of time. The\ngrain size distributions gain in complexity with time, are slewed towards large\ngrains, and differ from the usual MRN power-law distribution used for\ninterstellar dust. Gas density enhancements in the form of clumps strongly\naffect the dust chemical composition and the grain size distributions.\nSilicates and pure metallic grains are highly dependent on clumpiness.\nSpecifically, clumpy ejecta produce grains over 0.1 micron, and the final dust\nmass reaches 0.14 Msun. Conversely, carbon and alumina dust masses are\ncontrolled by the mass yields of alumina and carbon in the zones where the dust\nis produced. Several dust components form in the ejecta and the total dust mass\ngradually builds up over a time span of 3 to 5 years post-outburst.

Errors due to K-correction occur\nwhen the spectral template model underlying the lightcurve fitter poorly\nrepresents the actual supernova spectral energy distribution, meaning that the\ndistance modulus cannot be recovered accurately. In order to quantify this\neffect, synthetic photometry is performed on artificially redshifted\nspectrophotometric data from 119 low-redshift supernovae from the Nearby\nSupernova Factory, and the resulting lightcurves are fit with a conventional\nlightcurve fitter. We measure the variation in the standardized magnitude that\nwould be fit for a given supernova if located at a range of redshifts and\nobserved with various filter sets corresponding to current and future supernova\nsurveys. We find significant variation in the measurements of the same\nsupernovae placed at different redshifts regardless of filters used, which\ncauses dispersion greater than $\\sim0.05$ mag for measurements of photometry\nusing the Sloan-like filters and a bias that corresponds to a $0.03$ shift in\n$w$ when applied to an outside data set. To test the result of a shift in\nsupernova population or environment at higher redshifts, we repeat our\ncalculations with the addition of a reweighting of the supernovae as a function\nof redshift and find that this strongly affects the results and would have\nrepercussions for cosmology. We discuss possible methods to reduce the\ncontribution of the K-correction bias and uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 19:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-26"}

It is shown that over\na wide range of parameters the atmospheric boundary layer, rather than the\nlarge-scale circulation, is the key to understanding the planetary energy\nbalance. Through a scaling analysis of the interhemispheric energy transfer,\ntheoretical expressions for the day-night temperature difference and surface\nwind speed are created that reproduce the GCM results without tuning.

We report here on the\ndevelopment and testing of a new architecture for microfabricated ion traps,\nbuilt around ball-grid array (BGA) connections, that is suitable for\nincreasingly complex trap designs. In the BGA trap, through-substrate vias\nbring electrical signals from the back side of the trap die to the surface trap\nstructure on the top side. Gold-ball bump bonds connect the back side of the\ntrap die to an interposer for signal routing from the carrier. Trench\ncapacitors fabricated into the trap die replace area-intensive surface or edge\ncapacitors. Wirebonds in the BGA architecture are moved to the interposer.\nThese last two features allow the trap die to be reduced to only the area\nrequired to produce trapping fields. The smaller trap dimensions allow tight\nfocusing of an addressing laser beam for fast single-qubit rotations.\nPerformance of the BGA trap as characterized with $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions is\ncomparable to previous surface-electrode traps in terms of ion heating rate,\nmode frequency stability, and storage lifetime.

In particular, we show that the tSZ - CMB lensing\ncross-correlation is more sensitive to gas in lower-mass, higher-redshift halos\nand gas at larger cluster-centric radii than the tSZ - galaxy lensing\ncross-correlation. Combining these measurements with primary CMB data will\nconstrain feedback models through their signatures in the ICM pressure profile.\nWe forecast the ability of ongoing and future experiments to constrain such ICM\nparameters, including the mean amplitude of the pressure - mass relation, the\nredshift evolution of this amplitude, and the mean outer logarithmic slope of\nthe pressure profile.

(2) An epistemic notion\nof information is defined in terms of its relation to the Bayesian beliefs of\nideally rational agents.

In recent years\nsuch relativistic plasma has been unambiguously shown to interact with the\nsurrounding thermal intra-cluster medium (ICM) thanks to spectacular images\nwhere the lobe radio emission is observed to fill the cavities in the\nX-ray-emitting gas. This `radio feedback' phenomenon is widespread and is\ncritical to understand the physics of the inner regions of galaxy clusters and\nthe properties of the central BCG. At the same time, mechanically-powerful AGN\nare likely to drive turbulence in the central ICM which may also play a role\nfor the origin of non-thermal emission on cluster-scales. Diffuse non-thermal\nemission has been observed in a number of cool-core clusters in the form of a\nradio mini-halo surrounding the radio-loud BCG on scales comparable to that of\nthe cooling region. Large mini-halo samples are necessary to establish their\norigin and connection with the cluster thermal properties and dynamics,\nespecially in light of future X-ray characterization of the cluster cores as it\nis expected by Athena-XIFU. We show that All-Sky reference survey at Band 2\nwith SKA1 at confusion limit (rms ~2 {\\mu}Jy per beam) has the potential to\ndetect up to ~620 mini-halos at redshift z<0.6, whereas Deep Tier reference\nsurveys at Band 1/2 with SKA1 at sub-arcsec resolution (rms ~0.2 {\\mu}Jy per\nbeam) will allow a complete census of the radio-loud BCGs at any redshift down\nto a 1.4 GHz power of 10^{22} W/Hz. We further anticipate that SKA2 might\ndetect up to ~1900 new mini-halos at redshift z<0.6 and characterize the\nradio-mode AGN feedback in every cluster and group up to redshift z ~1.7 (the\nhighest-z where virialized clusters are currently detected).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 22:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-19"}

Our technique gives the first KDS for the theta graph (\\ie, $1$-SYG)\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$. It generalizes and improves on previous work on maintaining\nthe theta graph in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n  As an application, we use the kinetic $k$-SYG to provide the first KDS for\nmaintenance of all the $k$-nearest neighbors in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, for any $k\\geq\n1$. Previous works considered the $k=1$ case only. Our KDS for all the\n$1$-nearest neighbors is deterministic. The best previous KDS for all the\n$1$-nearest neighbors in $ \\mathbb{R}^d$ is randomized. Our structure and\nanalysis are simpler and improve on this work for the $k=1$ case.

When the H2 cooling is suppressed by FUV fields (G_0>10^-3) or\nthe metallicity is high enough (Z/Zs>10^-3), the interstellar medium is\nthermally unstable in the temperature range 100-7000 K owing to the cooling by\nCII and OI fine-structure lines. In this case, a bi-phasic medium with a\nbimodal density probability distribution is formed as a consequence of the\nthermal instability. The characteristic scales of the thermal instability\nbecome smaller with increasing metallicity. Comparisons of the nonlinear\nsimulations with different resolution indicates that the maximum scale of the\nthermal instability should be resolved with more than 60 cells to follow\nrunaway cooling driven by the thermal instability. Under sufficiently weak FUV\nfields and with low metallcity, the density range of the thermal instability\nshrinks owing to dominance of H2 cooling. As the FUV intensity is reduced,\nbi-phasic structure becomes less remarkable and disappears eventually. Our\nbasic results suggest that, in early galaxies, i) the thermal instability has\nlittle effect for the medium with Z/Zs<10^-4, ii) fragmentation by the thermal\ninstability could determine mass spectrum of star clusters for 10^-4<Z/Zs<0.04,\nand iii) thermally bistable turbulent interstellar medium like our galaxy\nbecomes ubiquitous for Z/Zs>0.04, although the threshold metallicity depends on\nthe conditions such as thermal pressure, FUV strength and redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 02:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The receiver operating\ncharacteristic is widely used in the machine learning community to analyze the\nperformance of parametric classifiers or sets of Pareto optimal classifiers. In\norder to directly compare two sets of classifiers the area (or volume) under\nthe convex hull can be used as a scalar indicator for the performance of a set\nof classifiers in receiver operating characteristic space.\n  Recently, the convex hull based multiobjective genetic programming algorithm\nwas proposed and successfully applied to maximize the convex hull area for\nbinary classification problems. The contribution of this paper is to extend\nthis algorithm for dealing with higher dimensional problem formulations. In\nparticular, we discuss problems where parsimony (or classifier complexity) is\nstated as a third objective and multi-class classification with three different\ntrue classification rates to be maximized.\n  The design of the algorithm proposed in this paper is inspired by\nindicator-based evolutionary algorithms, where first a performance indicator\nfor a solution set is established and then a selection operator is designed\nthat complies with the performance indicator. In this case, the performance\nindicator will be the volume under the convex hull. The algorithm is tested and\nanalyzed in a proof of concept study on different benchmarks that are designed\nfor measuring its capability to capture relevant parts of a convex hull.\n  Further benchmark and application studies on email classification and feature\nselection round up the analysis and assess robustness and usefulness of the new\nalgorithm in real world settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 03:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-19"}

By pair-wise\niterative interactions, the population reaches a consensus state\nasymptotically. In this paper, we study naming game with communication errors\nduring pair-wise conversations, where errors are represented by error rates in\na uniform probability distribution. First, a model of naming game with learning\nerrors in communications (NGLE) is proposed. Then, a strategy for agents to\nprevent learning errors is suggested. To that end, three typical topologies of\ncommunication networks, namely random-graph, small-world and scale-free\nnetworks with different parameters, are employed to investigate the effects of\nvarious learning errors. Simulation results on these models show that 1)\nlearning errors slightly affect the convergence speed but distinctively\nincrease the requirement for memory of each agent during lexicon propagation;\n2) the maximum number of different words held by the whole population increases\nlinearly as the value of the error rate increases; 3) without applying any\nstrategy to eliminate learning errors, there is a threshold value of the\nlearning errors which impairs the convergence. The new findings help to better\nunderstand the role of learning errors in naming game as well as human language\ndevelopment from a network science perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 04:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-19"}

Since ancient times,\nwatersheds separating adjacent water systems that flow, for example, toward\ndifferent seas, have been used to delimit boundaries. Interestingly, serious\nand even tense border disputes between countries have relied on the subtle\ngeometrical properties of these tortuous lines. For instance, slight and even\nanthropogenic modifications of landscapes can produce large changes in a\nwatershed, and the effects can be highly nonlocal. Although the watershed\nconcept arises naturally in geomorphology, where it plays a fundamental role in\nwater management, landslide, and flood prevention, it also has important\napplications in seemingly unrelated fields such as image processing and\nmedicine. Despite the far-reaching consequences of the scaling properties on\nwatershed-related hydrological and political issues, it was only recently that\na more profound and revealing connection has been disclosed between the concept\nof watershed and statistical physics of disordered systems. This review\ninitially surveys the origin and definition of a watershed line in a\ngeomorphological framework to subsequently introduce its basic geometrical and\nphysical properties.

We also suggest a strategy that\nwill enable new parameter space to be explored as the SKA expands over the\ncoming decade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 08:29:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-19"}

We compare the observed abundances to the\nnucleosynthetic predictions of AGB models and of models of rotating massive\nstars with internal mixing and mass loss. We also analyze the different\nbehaviors of $\\alpha$-- and CNO--elements, as well the abundances of elements\ninvolved in the Ne--Na and Mg--Al cycles. We show that CEMP-no stars exhibit\nproducts of He--burning that have gone through partial mixing and processing by\nthe CNO cycle, producing low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and a broad variety of [C/N] and\n[O/N] ratios. From a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C vs. [C/N] diagram, we conclude that\nneither the yields of AGB stars (in binaries or not) nor the yields of classic\nsupernovae can fully account for the observed CNO abundances in CEMP-no stars.\nBetter agreement is obtained once the chemical contribution by stellar winds of\nfast-rotating massive stars is taken into account, where partial mixing takes\nplace, leading to various amounts of CNO being ejected. CEMP--no stars present\na wide variety in the [C/Fe], [N/Fe], [O/Fe], [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], and\n[Sr/Fe] ratios.

We\naim to derive the gas composition in planets to evaluate if the formation of\ngiant planets with an enriched C/O ratio is possible. The study focusses on the\neffects of different processes on the C/O ratio like the disc evolution, the\ndrift of gas, and the migration of the planet. We used our previous models for\ncomputation of the chemical composition together with the planet formation\nmodel of Alibert et al.

The\nstudy focusses on the region where ice lines are present and influence the C/O\nratio of the planets. Modelling shows that the condensation of volatile species\nallows for C/O enrichment in specific parts of the protoplanetary disc, of up\nto 4 times the solar value. This leads to the formation of planets that can be\nenriched in C/O in their envelope up to 3 times the solar value. The migration\nof planets, the evolution of the gas phase, and the irradiation of the disc\nenables the evolution of the initial C/O ratio with a decrease in the outer\npart of the disc and an increase in the inner part. The total C/O ratio of the\nplanets is governed by the contribution of ices accreted, suggesting that high\nC/O ratios measured in planetary atmospheres are indicative of a lack of\nexchange of material between the core of a planet and its envelope or an\nobservational bias, and suggesting that the observed C/O ratio is not\nrepresentative of the total C/O ratio of the planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 10:08:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 10:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-11"}

One approach to address this issue is to\nlook at the Galactic bulge since it is the closest. According to some\ntheoretical models, our bulge may have built up from the merger of\nsubstructures formed from the fragmentation of a gaseous disk in the early\nphases of Galactic evolution. We may have discovered the remnant of one of\nthese substructures in the stellar system Terzan 5. In fact, Terzan 5 hosts two\nstellar populations with quite different iron abundances, thus suggesting it\nonce was far more massive than today. Moreover, its peculiar chemistry\nstrikingly resembles that observed in the Galactic bulge. In this Thesis we\nperformed a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of this cluster to\ndetermine its formation and evolution. Form the photometric point of view we\nbuilt a high-resolution differential reddening map in the direction of the\nsystem and we measured relative proper motions to separate its member\npopulation from the contaminating bulge and disk stars. From the spectroscopic\npoint of view we measured abundances for more than 600 stars belonging to\nTerzan 5 and its surroundings in order to build the largest\nfield-decontaminated metallicity distribution for this system. We find that the\nmetallicity distribution is extremely broad (>1 dex) and we discovered a third,\nmetal-poor and alpha-enhanced population with average [Fe/H]=-0.8 dex. The\nstriking similarity between Terzan 5 and the bulge in terms of their chemical\nformation and evolution that is clearly revealed by this Thesis suggests that\nTerzan 5 formed in situ with the Galactic bulge. In particular its metal-poor\npopulations trace the early stages of the bulge formation, while its most\nmetal-rich component may contain crucial information on the bulge more recent\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 10:45:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-19"}

These distributions are essential to\nunderstand the problem and allow subsequent study of topics such as the\ninfluence of particle shape, the structure of the clogging arches and the\npossible existence of a critical outlet size above which the outpouring will\nnever stop. I shall finally offer some hints about general ideas that can be\nexplored in the next few years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 11:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-19"}

We developed a toy model where internal\nshocks are limited to the collision of only two shells. Synthetic burst\npopulations were constructed for various distributions of the model parameters,\nsuch as the injected power in the relativistic outflow, the average Lorentz\nfactor, and its typical contrast between the shells.

However, due to the\nhigh-dimensional nature of image features that reduces the effectivity of index\nstructures (curse of dimensionality), due to the vast amount of features stored\nin image databases (images are often represented by up to several thousand\nfeatures), this ultimate goal demanded to trade query runtimes for query\nprecision. In this paper we address an approach complementary to indexing in\norder to improve the runtimes of retrieval by querying only the most promising\nkeypoint descriptors, as this affects matching runtimes linearly and can\ntherefore lead to increased efficiency. As this reduction of kNN queries\nreduces the number of tentative correspondences, a loss of query precision is\nminimized by an additional image-level correspondence generation stage with a\ncomputational performance independent of the underlying indexing structure. We\nevaluate such an adaption of the standard recognition pipeline on a variety of\ndatasets using both SIFT and state-of-the-art binary descriptors. Our results\nsuggest that decreasing the number of queried descriptors does not necessarily\nimply a reduction in the result quality as long as alternative ways of\nincreasing query recall (by thoroughly selecting k) and MAP (using image-level\ncorrespondence generation) are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 11:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 10:10:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 07:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

This task is problematic especially in\nhigh-dimensional non-Gaussian problems, where the structure of the posterior\ncan be very chaotic and difficult to analyse. Current inverse problem\nliterature often approaches the problem by considering suitable point\nestimators for the task. Typically the choice is made between the maximum a\nposteriori (MAP) or the conditional mean (CM) estimate.\n  The benefits of either choice are not well-understood from the perspective of\ninfinite-dimensional theory. Most importantly, there exists no general scheme\nregarding how to connect the topological description of a MAP estimate to a\nvariational problem. The results by Dashti et. al. (2013) resolve this issue\nfor non-linear inverse problems in Gaussian framework. In this work we improve\nthe current understanding by introducing a novel concept called the weak MAP\n(wMAP) estimate.

In clustered regions, understanding powering sources\nand outflow components poses a significant problem. Aims: To understand the\ndynamics in the outflow(s) from a cluster in the process of forming massive\nstars. Methods: We use new VLA observations of the molecular gas (SiO, CS, OCS\nand \\molec) in the massive star forming region IRAS 17233-3606 which contains a\nnumber of HII regions. We compare these observations to previously published\nmolecular data for this source in order to get a holistic view of the outflow\ndynamics. Results:We find that the dynamics of the various species can be\nexplained by a single large scale ($\\sim 0.15$ pc) outflow when compared to the\nsizes of the HII regions, with the different morphologies of the blue and red\noutflow components explained with respect to the morphology of the surrounding\nenvelope. We further find that the direction of the velocity gradients seen in\nOCS and \\molec are suggestive of a combination of rotation and outflow motions\nin the warm gas surrounding the HII regions near the base of the large scale\noutflow. Conclusions: Our results show that the massive protostars forming\nwithin this region appear to be contributing to a single outflow on large\nscales. This single large scale outflow is traced by a number of different\nspecies as the outflow interacts with its surroundings. On the small scales,\nthere appear to be multiple mechanisms contributing to the dynamics which could\nbe a combination of either a small scale outflow or rotation with the dynamics\nof the large scale outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 11:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-25"}

In particular the origin of\nthe radio emission and the mechanisms involved are among the open questions in\nastrophysics. In the radio-loud AGN population the radio emission is linked to\nthe presence of bipolar outflows of relativistic jets. However, the large\nmajority of the AGN population do not form powerful highly-relativistic jets on\nkpc scales and are characterized by radio luminosity up to 10^23 W/Hz at 1.4\nGHz, challenging our knowledge on the physical processes at the basis of the\nradio emission in radio-quiet objects. The main mechanisms proposed so far are\nsynchrotron radiation from mildly relativistic mini-jets, thermal\ncyclo-synchrotron emission by low-efficiency accretion flow (like ADAF or\nADIOS), or thermal free-free emission from the X-ray heated corona or wind. The\ndifficulty in understanding the main mechanism involved is related to the\nweakness of these objects, which precludes the study of non-local radio-quiet\nAGN.

Both\nmodels are investigated in the regimes of antiadiabaticity and strong\nHCB-phonon coupling with each site providing a different local optical phonon\nenvironment; furthermore, the HCB systems in both models are taken to be\ninitially uncorrelated with the environment in the polaronic frame of\nreference.

In the case of the\ntwo-site HCB model, we show clearly that the degree of decoherence and decay of\nexcited state are enhanced by the proximity of the site-energy difference to\nthe eigenenergy of phonons and are most pronounced when the site-energy\ndifference is at resonance with twice the polaronic energy; additionally, the\ndecoherence and the decay effects are reduced when the strength of HCB-phonon\ncoupling is increased.

The\ncurrent typical uncertainty in the observations accounts for 1 sigma\nstatistical relative error in age determination which in mean ranges from about\n-35% to +42%, depending on the mass. However, due to the strong dependence on\nthe evolutionary phase, the age relative error can be higher than 120% for\nstars near the ZAMS, while it is typically of the order of 20% or lower in the\nadvanced main-sequence phase. The systematic bias on age determination due to a\nvariation of $\\pm$ 1 in the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio Delta Y/Delta Z is\nabout one-forth of the statistical error in the first 30% of the evolution\nwhile it is negligible for more evolved stages. The maximum bias due to the\npresence of the convective core overshooting is of -7% and -13% for mild and\nstrong overshooting scenarios. For all the examined models the impact of a\nvariation of $\\pm$ 5 in the radiative opacity was found to be negligible. The\nmost important source of bias are the uncertainty in the mixing-length value\nalpha_ml and the neglect of microscopic diffusion. Each of these effects\naccounts for a bias which is nearly equal to the random error uncertainty.\nComparison of the results of our technique with other grid techniques on a set\nof common stars showed a general agreement. However, the adoption of a\ndifferent grid can account for a variation in the mean estimated age up to 1\nGyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 15:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-11"}

Evolving wormhole solutions are obtained when isotropic fluid\nis phantom in nature and there is a big rip singularity at the end. Here the\ndissipative phenomena is due to the particle creation mechanism in\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamics. Using the process to be adiabatic, the\ndissipative pressure is expressed linearly to the particle creation rate. For\ntwo choices of the particle creation rate as a function of the Hubble\nparameter, the equation of state parameter of the isotropic fluid is\nconstrained to be in the phantom domain, except in one choice, it is possible\nto have wormhole configuration with normal isotropic fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 15:40:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Jan 2015 15:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-27"}

Unlike previous empirical studies, our study found that it is not\nalways true that there are more refactoring activities before major project\nrelease date than after. In contrast, we were able to confirm that software\ndevelopers perform different types of refactoring operations on test code and\nproduction code, specific developers are responsible for refactorings in the\nproject, refactoring edits are not very well tested. Further, floss refactoring\nis more popular among the developers, refactoring activity is frequent in the\nprojects, majority of bad smells once occurred they persist up to the latest\nversion of the system. By confirming assumptions by other researchers we can\nhave greater confidence that those research conclusions are generalizable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 01:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-22"}

The proposition that standard quantum\nmechanics is itself nonlocal (more precisely, that it violates `local\ncausality') became divorced from the Bell theorem per se from 1976 on, although\nthis important point is widely overlooked in the literature. In 1990, the year\nof his death, Bell would express serious misgivings about the mathematical form\nof the local causality condition, and leave ill-defined the issue of the\nconsistency between special relativity and violation of the Bell-type\ninequality. In our view, the significance of the Bell theorem, both in its\ndeterministic and stochastic forms, can only be fully understood by taking into\naccount the fact that a fully Lorentz-covariant version of quantum theory, free\nof action-at-a-distance, can be articulated in the Everett interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 16:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-16"}
