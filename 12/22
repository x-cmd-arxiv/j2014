Two incidences $(v,e)$ and\n$(w,f)$ are adjacent if one of the following holds: (i) $v = w$, (ii) $e = f$\nor (iii) $vw = e$ or $f$. An incidence coloring of $G$ assigns a color to each\nincidence of $G$ in such a way that adjacent incidences get distinct colors. In\n2005, Hosseini Dolama \\emph{et al.}~\\citep{ds05} proved that every graph with\nmaximum average degree strictly less than $3$ can be incidence colored with\n$\\Delta+3$ colors.

It is not, however, common practice to account for the effects of\ncosmological parameter value uncertainties. The convention is to instead use a\nsingle fiducial \"concordance cosmology\" and generate lens models assuming zero\nuncertainty in cosmological parameter values. We find that the magnification\nmaps of the individual HFF clusters vary significantly when lens models are\ncomputed using different cosmological parameter values taken from recent\nliterature constraints from space- and ground-based experiments. Specifically,\nthe magnification maps have average variances across the best fit models\ncomputed using different cosmologies that are comparable in magnitude to - and\nas much as 2.5 times larger than - the model fitting uncertainties in each best\nfit model.

Our\nefforts, i.e., with Fran\\c{c}ois Perrot, sought to apply density functional\ntheory (DFT) to SCCS calculations. DFT was then poised to become the major\ncomputational scheme for condensed matter physics. The ion-sphere models of\nSalpeter and others evolved into useful average-atom models for finite-$T$\nCoulomb systems, as in Lieberman's Inferno code. We replaced these by\ncorrelation-sphere models that exploit the description of matter via density\nfunctionals linked to pair-distributions. These methods provided practical\ncomputational means for studying strongly interacting electron-ion Coulomb\nsystems like warm-dense matter (WDM). The staples of SCCS are wide-ranged,\nviz., equation of state, plasma spectroscopy, opacity (absorption, emission),\nscattering, level shifts, transport properties, e.g., electrical and heat\nconductivity, laser- and shock- created plasmas, their energy relaxation and\ntransient properties etc. These calculations need pseudopotentials and\nexchange-correlation functionals applicable to finite-$T$ Coulomb systems that\nmay be used in ab initio codes, molecular dynamics, etc. The search for simpler\ncomputational schemes has proceeded via proposals for orbital-free DFT,\nstatistical potentials, classical maps of quantum systems using classical\nschemes like HNC to include strong coupling effects (CHNC).

Centrality classes are defined\nusing different event activity estimators, i.e. charged particle multiplicities\nmeasured in three disjunct pseudorapidity regions as well as the energy\nmeasured at beam rapidity (zero-degree). The procedures to determine the\ncentrality, quantified by the number of participants ($N_{\\rm part}$), or the\nnumber of nucleon-nucleon binary collisions ($N_{\\rm coll}$), are described. We\nshow that, in contrast to Pb-Pb collisions, in p-Pb collisions large\nmultiplicity fluctuations together with the small range of participants\navailable, generate a dynamical bias in centrality classes based on particle\nmultiplicity. We propose to use the zero-degree energy, which we expect not to\nintroduce a dynamical bias, as an alternative event-centrality estimator. Based\non zero-degree energy centrality classes, the $N_{\\rm part}$ dependence of\nparticle production is studied. Under the assumption that the multiplicity\nmeasured in the Pb-going rapidity region scales with the number of\nPb-participants, an approximate independence of the multiplicity per\nparticipating nucleon measured at mid-rapitity of the number of participating\nnucleons is observed.

In this article, each musical element is\nrelated by equations and algorithms to the discrete-time samples of sounds, and\neach of these relations are implemented in scripts within a software toolbox,\nreferred to as MASS (Music and Audio in Sample Sequences). The fundamental\nelement, the musical note with duration, volume, pitch and timbre, is related\nquantitatively to characteristics of the digital signal. Internal variations of\na note, such as tremolos, vibratos and spectral fluctuations, are also\nconsidered, which enables the synthesis of notes inspired by real instruments\nand new sonorities. With this representation of notes, resources are provided\nfor the generation of higher scale musical structures, such as rhythmic meter,\npitch intervals and cycles. This framework enables precise and trustful\nscientific experiments, data sonification and is useful for education and art.\nThe efficacy of MASS is confirmed by the synthesis of small musical pieces\nusing basic notes, elaborated notes and notes in music, which reflects the\norganization of the toolbox and thus of this article.

Although H2O lines in M\ndwarfs are badly blended each other and the continuum levels are depressed\nappreciably by the collective effect of numerous H2O lines themselves,\nquantitative analysis of H2O lines has been carried out by referring to the\npseudo-continua both on the observed and theoretical spectra. For this purpose,\nthe pseudo-continuum on the theoretical spectrum has been evaluated by the use\nof the recent high-precision H2O line-list. Then, we propose a simple and\nflexible method of analyzing equivalent widths (EWs) of blended features by the\nuse of a mini curve-of-growth (CG), which is a small portion of the usual CG\naround the observed EW. The mini CG is generated by using the theoretical EWs\nevaluated from the synthetic spectrum by exactly the same way as the EWs are\nmeasured from the observed spectrum. The observed EW is converted to the\nabundance by the use of the mini CG, and the process is repeated for all the\nobserved EWs line-by-line or blend-by-blend.

Then the numerous H2O lines are excellent abundance indicators of\noxygen. The oxygen abundances are determined to be logAo between -3.5 and -3.0\nin 38 M dwarfs. The resulting O/C ratios plotted against logAc appear to be\nsystematically smaller in the carbon-rich M dwarfs, showing the different\nformation histories of oxygen and carbon in the chemical evolution of the\nGalactic disk.

Persea is the most recent approach towards designing a\nsocial network based Sybil-resistant DHT. Unlike prior Sybil-resistant P2P\nsystems based on social networks, Persea does not rely on two key assumptions:\n(i) that the social network is fast mixing, and (ii) that there is a small\nratio of attack edges to honest peers. Both assumptions have been shown to be\nunreliable in real social networks. The hierarchical distribution of node IDs\nin Persea confines a large attacker botnet to a considerably smaller region of\nthe ID space than in a normal P2P system and its replication mechanism lets a\npeer to retrieve the desired results even if a given region is occupied by\nattackers. However, Persea system suffers from certain limitations, since it\ncannot handle the scenario, where the malicious target returns an incorrect\nresult instead of just ignoring the lookup request. In this paper, we address\nthis major limitation of Persea through a Sybil detection mechanism built on\ntop of Persea system, which accommodates inspection lookup, a specially\ndesigned lookup scheme to detect the Sybil nodes based on their responses to\nthe lookup query. We design a scheme to filter those detected Sybils to ensure\nthe participation of honest nodes on the lookup path during regular DHT lookup.\nSince the malicious nodes are opt-out from the lookup path in our system, they\ncannot return any incorrect result during regular lookup. We evaluate our\nsystem in simulations with social network datasets and the results show that\ncatster, the largest network in our simulation with 149700 nodes and 5449275\nedges, gains 100% lookup success rate, even when the number of attack edges is\nequal to the number of benign peers in the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 06:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-23"}

Both aspects were mainly studied where thermal population is far weaker\nthan photonic excitation, obscuring the generalization of PL and thermal\nemissions.

To search for a trimer superfluid and trimer\nsupersolid, we load the cold atom into two-dimensional lattices, whose\ncoordinate number $z$ and kinetic energy $-zJ$ are respectively larger and\nlower than those of a one dimensional lattice. Herein, we study the\nBose-Hubbard model, which has an additional trimer tunneling term, a three-body\ninteraction and a next-nearest repulsion. The on-site trimer and trimer\nsuperfluid exist if the on-site two-body repulsion and three-body repulsion are\nsmaller than some thresholds. With atom-tunneling terms, the phase transitions\nfrom trimer superfluid phase to both atom superfluid and atom supersolid phases\nare first order.

The phase transitions from the trimer supersolid phase to quasi\ntrimer solid are first order and the phase transition from the trimer\nsupersolid phase to trimer solid is continuous.

The\ntechnique allows astronomers to chart the distribution of dark matter on large\nand small scales thereby testing predictions of the standard cosmological model\nwhich assumes dark matter comprises a massive weakly-interacting particle. By\nmeasuring distances and tracing the growth of dark matter structure over cosmic\ntime, gravitational lensing also holds great promise in determining whether the\ndark energy, postulated to explain the accelerated cosmic expansion, is a\nvacuum energy density or a failure of General Relativity on large scales. We\nillustrate the wide range of applications which harness the power of\ngravitational lensing, from searches for the earliest galaxies magnified by\nmassive clusters to those for extrasolar planets which temporarily brighten a\nbackground star. We summarise the future prospects with dedicated ground and\nspace-based facilities designed to exploit this remarkable physical phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 10:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

We investigate the effects of ionising photons on accretion and stellar\nmass growth in a young star forming region, using a Monte Carlo radiation\ntransfer code coupled to a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation.\nMethods. We introduce the framework with which we correct stellar cluster\nmasses for the effects of photoionising (PI) feedback and compare to the\nresults of a full ionisation hydrodynamics code. Results. We present results of\nour simulations of star formation in the spiral arm of a disk galaxy, including\nthe effects of photoionising radiation from high mass stars. We find that PI\nfeedback reduces the total mass accreted onto stellar clusters by approximately\n23 per cent over the course of the simulation and reduces the number of high\nmass clusters, as well as the maximum mass attained by a stellar cluster.

On the other hand, the radio-loud\nBALQSOs are more X-ray loud than the radio-quiet ones. This suggests that part\nof the X-ray emission may arise from the radio jet. To investigate this\npossibility, we modelled the nuclear spectra of two radio-loud BALQSOs. We\nfocus on the emission from the very centres of these two objects. The source of\nemission was approximated by a single, homogeneous component that produces\nsynchrotron and inverse-Compton (IC) radiation. The simplicity of the model\nallowed us to estimate the basic physical parameters of the emitting regions,\nusing a universal analytic approach. Such methods have already been used in\nblazars. For the first time we propose this solution for quasars. In addition,\nwe modelled the radiation spectra of the accretion disk and its corona to\ncompare them with the jets' spectra. We find that in the case of luminous\n3C270.1, the nuclear X-ray continuum is dominated by the non-thermal, IC\nemission from the innermost parts of the radio jet. However, the radio core of\nthe lobe-dominated PG 1004+130 is probably too weak to produce significant part\nof the observed X-ray emission. A large contribution from the X-ray emitting\naccretion disk and corona is produced in our model. However, it then exceeds\nthe observed flux. Because the large intrinsic absorption was postulated\nrecently by the NuSTAR observations, we propose that the disk-corona component\nmay still account for the X-rays produced in this source. This part of the\nspectrum must nevertheless be dominated by the X-ray jet. We conclude that the\njet-linked X-ray emission is present in strong and weak radio sources, but its\nfraction seems to scale with the radio jet power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 11:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We also develop a simple\nmethod to quantify geometric frustration in terms of a frustration index\n$\\phi(\\beta,T)$, where $\\beta$ = $J/\\tilde{J}$, the ratio of the two exchange\ncouplings required by the symmetry of the Cairo lattice.

To tackle the problem, we\nintroduce a class of partitions, termed dilute partitions, of formations which\ncluster agents according to the inter- and intra-cluster interaction strengths.\nWe then apply dilute partitions to trajectories of formations generated by the\nmulti-agent system, and show that each of the trajectories remains bounded\nalong the evolution, and converges to the set of equilibria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 12:26:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 01:12:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 00:26:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 19:49:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 03:39:37 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 03:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-15"}

However such models are difficult to analyze. To address this, we\ndevelop a probabilistic analysis method by approximating the mode transitions\nas stochastic events. We assume that the probability of making a mode\ntransition is proportional to the measure of the set of pairs of time points\nand value states at which the mode transition is enabled. To ensure a sound\nmathematical basis, we impose a natural continuity property on the non-linear\nODEs. We also assume that the states of the system are observed at discrete\ntime points but that the mode transitions may take place at any time between\ntwo successive discrete time points. This leads to a discrete time Markov chain\nas a probabilistic approximation of the hybrid system. We then show that for\nBLTL (bounded linear time temporal logic) specifications the hybrid system\nmeets a specification iff its Markov chain approximation meets the same\nspecification with probability $1$. Based on this, we formulate a sequential\nhypothesis testing procedure for verifying -approximately- that the Markov\nchain meets a BLTL specification with high probability. Our case studies on\ncardiac cell dynamics and the circadian rhythm indicate that our scheme can be\napplied in a number of realistic settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 12:27:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2015 03:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

If G the boundary of a three dimensional graph H for example, we can\nrefine the interior until it is colourable with 4 colours. The later goal is\nachieved if all interior edge degrees are even. Using a refinement process\nwhich cuts the interior along surfaces we can adapt the degrees along the\nboundary of that surface. More efficient is a self-cobordism of G with itself\nwith a host graph discretizing the product of G with an interval. It follows\nfrom the fact that Euler curvature is zero everywhere for three dimensional\ngeometric graphs, that the odd degree edge set O is a cycle and so a boundary\nif H is simply connected. A reduction to minimal colouring would imply the four\ncolour theorem. The method is expected to give a reason \"why 4 colours suffice\"\nand suggests that every two dimensional geometric graph of arbitrary degree and\norientation can be coloured by 5 colours: since the projective plane can not be\na boundary of a 3-dimensional graph and because for higher genus surfaces, the\ninterior H is not simply connected, we need in general to embed a surface into\na 4-dimensional simply connected graph in order to colour it.

Astrometric monitoring of directly-imaged exoplanets allows the\nstudy of their orbital parameters and system architectures. Because most\ndirectly-imaged planets have long orbital periods (>20 AU), accurate astrometry\nis challenging when based on data acquired on timescales of a few years and\nusually with different instruments. The LMIRCam camera on the LBT is being used\nfor the LEECH survey to search for and characterize young and adolescent\nexoplanets in L' band, including their system architectures. Aims. We first aim\nto provide a good astrometric calibration of LMIRCam. Then, we derive new\nastrometry, test the predictions of the orbital model of 8:4:2:1 mean motion\nresonance proposed by Go\\'zdziewski & Migaszewski, and perform new orbital\nfitting of the HR 8799 bcde planets. We also present deep limits on a putative\nfifth planet interior to the known planets. Methods. We use observations of HR\n8799 and the Theta1 Ori C field obtained during the same run in October 2013.\nResults. We first characterize the distortion of LMIRCam. We determine a\nplatescale and a true north orientation for the images of 10.707 +/- 0.012\nmas/pix and -0.430 +/- 0.076 deg, respectively. The errors on the platescale\nand true north orientation translate into astrometric accuracies at a\nseparation of 1 of 1.1 mas and 1.3 mas, respectively. The measurements for all\nplanets are usually in agreement within 3 sigma with the ephemeris predicted by\nGo\\'zdziewski & Migaszewski. The orbital fitting based on the new astrometric\nmeasurements favors an architecture for the planetary system based on 8:4:2:1\nmean motion resonance. The detection limits allow us to exclude a fifth planet\nslightly brighter/more massive than HR 8799 b at the location of the 2:1\nresonance with HR 8799 e (~9.5 AU) and about twice as bright as HR 8799 cde at\nthe location of the 3:1 resonance with HR 8799 e (~7.5 AU).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 14:24:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 16:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

An analysis of the Fermi-LAT data has shown an\nextended HE gamma-ray emission with a 0.2-100 GeV spectrum exhibiting no\nsignificant deviation from a power law, unlike most of the GeV-emitting SNRs\nknown to be interacting with molecular clouds. This makes it a promising target\nfor imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) to probe the gamma-ray\nemission above 100 GeV. Very-high-energy (VHE, E >= 0.1 TeV) gamma-ray emission\nfrom Puppis A is for the first time searched for with the High Energy\nStereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). The analysis of the H.E.S.S. data does not\nreveal any significant emission towards Puppis A. The derived upper limits on\nthe differential photon flux imply that its broadband gamma-ray spectrum must\nexhibit a spectral break or cutoff. By combining Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S.\nmeasurements, the 99% confidence level upper limits on such a cutoff are found\nto be 450 and 280 GeV, assuming a power law with a simple exponential and a\nsub-exponential cutoff, respectively. It is concluded that none of the standard\nlimitations (age, size, radiative losses) on the particle acceleration\nmechanism, assumed to be still on-going at present, can explain the lack of VHE\nsignal. The scenario in which particle acceleration has ceased some time ago is\nconsidered as an alternative explanation. The HE/VHE spectrum of Puppis A could\nthen exhibit a break of non-radiative origin, (as observed in several other\ninteracting SNRs, albeit at somewhat higher energies) owing to the interaction\nwith dense and neutral material in particular towards the northeastern region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 14:38:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 12:44:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

The problem is defined as follows. We are given an interconnection\nnetwork and a number of load items, which are arbitrarily distributed among the\nnodes of the network. The goal is to redistribute the load in iterative\ndiscrete steps such that at the end each node has (almost) the same number of\nitems. In diffusion load balancing nodes are only allowed to balance their load\nwith their direct neighbors.\n  We show three main results. Firstly, we present a general framework for\nrandomly rounding the flow generated by continuous diffusion schemes over the\nedges of a graph in order to obtain corresponding discrete schemes. Compared to\nthe results of Rabani, Sinclair, and Wanka, FOCS'98, which are only valid\nw.r.t. the class of homogeneous first order schemes, our framework can be used\nto analyze a larger class of diffusion algorithms, such as algorithms for\nheterogeneous networks and second order schemes. Secondly, we bound the\ndeviation between randomized second order schemes and their continuous\ncounterparts. Finally, we provide a bound for the minimum initial load in a\nnetwork that is sufficient to prevent the occurrence of negative load at a node\nduring the execution of second order diffusion schemes.\n  Our theoretical results are complemented with extensive simulations on\ndifferent graph classes. We show empirically that second order schemes, which\nare usually much faster than first order schemes, will not balance the load\ncompletely on a number of networks within reasonable time. However, the maximum\nload difference at the end seems to be bounded by a constant value, which can\nbe further decreased if first order scheme is applied once this value is\nachieved by second order scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 15:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-23"}
