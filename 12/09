This method\nfits into an abstract framework for space-time discontinuous Galerkin methods\nfor which we can prove consistency, stability, and energy dissipation without\nthe need to completely specify the approximation spaces in detail. Any method\nof such a general form results in an implicit time-stepping scheme with some\nbasic stability properties. For the local approximation on each space-time\nelement, we then consider Trefftz polynomials, i.e., the subspace of\npolynomials that satisfy Maxwell's equations exactly on the respective element.\nWe present an explicit construction of a basis for the local Trefftz spaces in\ntwo and three dimensions and summarize some of their basic properties. Using\nlocal properties of the Trefftz polynomials, we can establish the\nwell-posedness of the resulting discontinuous Galerkin Trefftz method.\nConsistency, stability, and energy dissipation then follow immediately from the\nresults about the abstract framework. The method proposed in this paper\ntherefore shares many of the advantages of more standard discontinuous Galerkin\nmethods, while at the same time, it yields a substantial reduction in the\nnumber of degrees of freedom and the cost for assembling.

These three quantities constitute a full\ncharacterization of the interaction at nanoscale. They are measured\nindependently, simultaneously and quantitatively at the same place. This is\nmade possible thanks to a force feedback method that ensures the DC immobility\nof the tip and to the simultaneous application of a sub-nanometer oscillation\nto the tip. In this established linear regime, stiffness and damping are\ndirectly obtained from amplitude and phase change measurements. The needed\ninformation for this linear transformation is solely the lever properties in\nthe experimental context. Knowledge of k, its stiffness, its damping\ncoefficient and Q0, its first resonance frequency is shown to be sufficient in\nthe frequency range we are here exploring. Finally, we demonstrate that this\nmethod is not restricted to the lever resonance frequency. To the contrary,\nthis interaction characterization whose resolution is limited by the Brownian\nmotion, can be used at any frequencies with essentially the same performances.\nWe believe that simultaneous and independent measurements of force, stiffness\nand damping, out of lever resonance, at nanoscale, and within the context of\nlinear response define a new AFM paradigm that we call Force Feedback\nMicroscopy (FFM).

In fact, the particle beam cross section varies along\nthe wiggler. It is usually stated that the effective photon source size\nincreases accordingly, while the brightness is reduced. Here we claim that this\nis a misconception originating from an analysis of the wiggler source based on\ngeometrical arguments, regarded as almost self-evident. According to\nelectrodynamics, depth-of-field effects do not exist: we demonstrate this\nstatement both theoretically and numerically, using a well-known\nfirst-principle computer code. This fact shows that under the usually accepted\napproximations, the description of the wiggler brightness turns out to be\ninconsistent even qualitatively. Therefore, there is a need for a well-defined\nprocedure for computing the brightness from a wiggler source. We accomplish\nthis task based on the use of a Wigner function formalism. In the geometrical\noptics limit computations can be performed analytically. Within this limit, we\nrestrict ourselves to the case of the beam size-dominated regime, which is\ntypical for synchrotron radiation facilities in the X-ray wavelength range.

In this paper we address this\nquestion by jointly exploring human psychophysics and a cognitively motivated\ncomputer vision model, which can detect the 3D direction of gaze from 2D face\nimages. The synthesis of behavioral study and computer vision yields several\ninteresting discoveries. (1) Human accuracy of discriminating targets\n8{\\deg}-10{\\deg} of visual angle apart is around 40% in a free looking gaze\ntask; (2) The ability to interpret gaze of different lookers vary dramatically;\n(3) This variance can be captured by the computational model; (4) Human\noutperforms the current model significantly. These results collectively show\nthat the acuity of human joint attention is indeed highly impressive, given the\ncomputational challenge of the natural looking task. Moreover, the gap between\nhuman and model performance, as well as the variability of gaze interpretation\nacross different lookers, require further understanding of the underlying\nmechanisms utilized by humans for this challenging task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 17:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-09"}

Several routes to\naddress open-shell nuclei are currently under investigation, including ideas\nwhich exploit spontaneous symmetry breaking. Singly open-shell nuclei can be\nefficiently described via the sole breaking of $U(1)$ gauge symmetry associated\nwith particle number conservation, to account for their superfluid character.\nThe present work formulates and applies Bogoliubov coupled cluster (BCC)\ntheory, which consists of representing the exact ground-state wavefunction of\nthe system as the exponential of a quasiparticle excitation cluster operator\nacting on a Bogoliubov reference state. Equations for the ground-state energy\nand cluster amplitudes are derived at the singles and doubles level (BCCSD)\nboth algebraically and diagrammatically. The formalism includes three-nucleon\nforces at the normal-ordered two-body level. The first BCC code is implemented\nin $m$-scheme, which will eventually permit the treatment of doubly open-shell\nnuclei. Proof-of-principle calculations in an $N_{\\text{max}}=6$ spherical\nharmonic oscillator basis are performed for $^{16,18,20}$O, $^{18}$Ne,\n$^{20}$Mg in the BCCD approximation with a chiral two-nucleon interaction,\ncomparing to results obtained in standard coupled cluster theory when\napplicable. The breaking of $U(1)$ symmetry is monitored by computing the\nvariance associated with the particle-number operator. The newly developed\nmany-body formalism increases the potential span of ab initio calculations\nbased on single-reference coupled cluster techniques tremendously, i.e.\npotentially to reach several hundred additional mid-mass nuclei. The new\nformalism offers a wealth of potential applications and further extensions\ndedicated to the description of ground and excited states of open-shell nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 18:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-02"}

The effects of flux contribution from an unseen\nsecondary were considered for the binary sample. We present the first\nsystematic study of the incidence of binarity for a sample of BSGs across the\ntheoretical terminal age main sequence (TAMS). To account for the distribution\nof effective temperatures of the BSGs it may be necessary to extend the TAMS to\nlower temperatures. This is consistent with the derived distribution of mass\ndiscrepancies, projected rotational velocities (vsini) and N abundances,\nprovided that stars cooler than this temperature are post RSG objects. For the\nBSGs in the Tarantula and previous FLAMES surveys, most have small vsini. About\n10% have larger vsini (>100 km/s) but surprisingly these show little or no N\nenhancement. All the cooler BSGs have low vsini of <70km/s and high N abundance\nestimates, implying that either bi-stability braking or evolution on a blue\nloop may be important. A lack of cool binaries, possibly reflects the small\nsample size. Single star evolutionary models, which include rotation, can\naccount for the N enhancement in both the single and binary samples. The\ndetailed distribution of N abundances in the single and binary samples may be\ndifferent, possibly reflecting differences in their evolutionary history. The\nfirst comparative study of single and binary BSGs has revealed that the main\nsequence may be significantly wider than previously assumed, extending to\nTeff=20000K. Some marginal differences in single and binary atmospheric\nparameters and abundances have been identified, possibly implying non-standard\nevolution for some of the sample.

In this work, we generalize the optimality of\nTIN to compound networks. We show that for a K-user compound Gaussian\ninterference channel, if in every possible state for each receiver, the channel\nalways satisfies the TIN-optimality condition identified by Geng et al., then\nthe GDoF region of the compound channel is the intersection of the GDoF regions\nof all possible network realizations, which is achievable by power control and\nTIN. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a general K-user compound\ninterference channel, regardless of the number of states of each receiver, we\ncan always construct a counterpart K-user regular interference channel that has\nthe same TIN region as the original compound channel. The regular interference\nchannel has only one state for each receiver, which may be different from all\nof the original states. Solving the GDoF-based power control problem for the\ncompound channel is equivalent to solving the same problem in its regular\ncounterpart. Exploring the power control problem further we develop a\ncentralized power control scheme for K-user compound interference channels, to\nachieve all the Pareto optimal GDoF tuples. Finally, based on this scheme, we\ndevise an iterative power control algorithm which requires at most K updates to\nobtain the globally optimal power allocation for any feasible GDoF tuple.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 19:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-09"}

Here we review the current status of\nmodels that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy\nformation: semi-analytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We\nfocus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the\nglobal and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon\n($z\\sim 2-3$) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall,\nmodels show remarkable convergence between different methods and make\npredictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem\nto have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for\nshaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion,\nstrong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole\nfeedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and\nstructural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental\nprocesses. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological\nimplementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to\nobservations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a\nhierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging\nmulti-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and\ncosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded\nfooting. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new\nchallenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining\ninflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 19:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-23"}

The FRI method analyzes protein\nrigidity and flexibility and is capable of predicting protein B-factors without\nresorting to matrix diagonalization. A fundamental assumption used in the FRI\nis that protein structures are uniquely determined by various internal and\nexternal interactions, while the protein functions, such as stability and\nflexibility, are solely determined by the structure. As such, one can predict\nprotein flexibility without resorting to the protein interaction Hamiltonian.\nConsequently, bypassing the matrix diagonalization, the original FRI has a\ncomputational complexity of O(N^2). This work introduces a fast FRI (fFRI)\nalgorithm for the flexibility analysis of large macromolecules. The proposed\nfFRI further reduces the computational complexity to O(N).

In this paper, the\nimpact of user pairing on the performance of two NOMA systems, NOMA with fixed\npower allocation (F-NOMA) and cognitive radio inspired NOMA (CR-NOMA), is\ncharacterized. For FNOMA, both analytical and numerical results are provided to\ndemonstrate that F-NOMA can offer a larger sum rate than orthogonal MA, and the\nperformance gain of F-NOMA over conventional MA can be further enlarged by\nselecting users whose channel conditions are more distinctive. For CR-NOMA, the\nquality of service (QoS) for users with the poorer channel condition can be\nguaranteed since the transmit power allocated to other users is constrained\nfollowing the concept of cognitive radio networks. Because of this constraint,\nCR-NOMA has different behavior compared to F-NOMA. For example, for the user\nwith the best channel condition, CR-NOMA prefers to pair it with the user with\nthe second best channel condition, whereas the user with the worst channel\ncondition is preferred by F-NOMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 22:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

Its main characteristic is to allow the cooperation of\nhabitual and goal-directed behaviors, with the hippocampus primarily involved\nin encoding spatial information and simulating possible navigation paths, and\nthe ventral and dorsal striatum involved in learning stimulus-response\nbehaviors and evaluating the reward expectancies associated to predicted\nlocations and sensed stimuli, respectively. The architecture we present employs\nan unsupervised reinforcement learning rule for the hippocampal-striatal\nnetwork that is able to build a representation of the environment in which\nrewarding sites and informative landmarks produce value gradients that are used\nfor planning and decision making. Additionally, it utilizes an arbitration\nmechanism that balances between exploitation, i.e. stimulus-response behaviors,\nand mental exploration, i.e. motor imagery processes, based on the intensity\nand the variability of the responses of striatal neurons. We interpret these\nresults in light of recent experimental data that show anticipatory activations\nin hippocampal and striatal areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 00:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

In proximal\ninteraction, the human and robot often engage in close coordination; in remote\ninteraction, the human and robot are less coupled due to communication\nconstraints. As a result, providing automation for the robot in remote\ninteraction becomes more important. Thus far, human factor studies on\nautomation in remote human-robot interaction have been restricted to various\nforms of supervision, in which the robot is essentially being used as a smart\nmobile manipulation platform with sensing capabilities. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the incorporation of general planning capability into the robot to\nfacilitate peer-to-peer human-robot teaming, in which the human and robot are\nviewed as teammates that are physically separated. The human and robot share\nthe same global goal and collaborate to achieve it. Note that humans may feel\nuncomfortable at such robot autonomy, which can potentially reduce teaming\nperformance. One important difference between peer-to-peer teaming and\nsupervised teaming is that an autonomous robot in peer-to-peer teaming can\nachieve the goal alone when the task information is completely specified.\nHowever, incompleteness often exists, which implies information asymmetry.\nWhile information asymmetry can be desirable sometimes, it may also lead to the\nrobot choosing improper actions that negatively influence the teaming\nperformance.

As a finite-volume\nscheme, the evolution of the average flow variables in a control volume is\nunder the Eulerian framework, whereas the construction of the numerical flux\nacross the cell interface comes from the Lagrangian perspective. The adoption\nof the Lagrangian aspect makes the collision and the transport mechanisms\nintrinsically coupled together in the flux evaluation. As a result, the time\nstep is independent of the particle collision time and solely determined by the\nCourant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) conditions. A set of simulations are carried out\nto validate the performance of the new scheme. The results show that with\nsecond-order spatial accuracy, the scheme exhibits low numerical dissipation,\nand can accurately capture the Navier-Stokers solutions for the smooth flows\nwith viscous heat dissipation from the low-speed incompressible to hypersonic\ncompressible regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 06:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

Their\nimplementation is a key challenge for quantum science and requires the\ndevelopment of stationary quantum nodes that can send and receive as well as\nstore and process quantum information locally. The nodes are connected by\nquantum channels for flying information carriers, i.e. photons. These channels\nserve both to directly exchange quantum information between nodes as well as to\ndistribute entanglement over the whole network. In order to scale such networks\nto many particles and long distances, an efficient interface between the nodes\nand the channels is required. This article describes the cavity-based approach\nto this goal, with an emphasis on experimental systems in which single atoms\nare trapped in and coupled to optical resonators. Besides being conceptually\nappealing, this approach is promising for quantum networks on larger scales, as\nit gives access to long qubit coherence times and high light-matter coupling\nefficiencies. Thus, it allows one to generate entangled photons on the push of\na button, to reversibly map the quantum state of a photon onto an atom, to\ntransfer and teleport quantum states between remote atoms, to entangle distant\natoms, to detect optical photons nondestructively, to perform entangling\nquantum gates between an atom and one or several photons, and even provides a\nroute towards efficient heralded quantum memories for future repeaters. The\npresented general protocols and the identification of key parameters are\napplicable to other experimental systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 08:59:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 20:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-21"}

Those zones are likely to be differentially\nrotating, which suggests that strong interactions between differential rotation\nand magnetic fields could be at play. We numerically compute the joint\nevolution of the magnetic and velocity fields in a 3D spherical shell starting\nfrom an initial profile for the poloidal magnetic field and differential\nrotation. The poloidal magnetic field is initially wound-up by the differential\nrotation to produce a toroidal field which becomes unstable. In the particular\nsetup studied here where the differential rotation is dominant, the\nmagneto-rotational instability is triggered. The growth rate of the instability\ndepends mainly on the initial rotation rate, while the background state\ntypically oscillates over a poloidal Alfv\\'en time. We thus find that the\naxisymmetric magnetic configuration is strongly modified by the instability\nonly if the ratio between the poloidal Alfv\\'en frequency and the rotation rate\nis sufficiently small. An enhanced transport of angular momentum is found in\nthe most unstable cases: the typical time to flatten the rotation profile is\nthen much faster than the diffusion time scale. We conclude that the\nmagneto-rotational instability is always favored (over the Tayler instability)\nin unstratified spherical shells when an initial poloidal field is sheared by a\nsufficiently strong cylindrical differential rotation. A possible application\nto the magnetic desert observed among A stars is given. We argue that the\ndichotomy between stars exhibiting strong axisymmetric fields (Ap stars) and\nthose harboring a sub-Gauss magnetism could be linked to the threshold for the\ninstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 10:13:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2014 15:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We investigate both tubulin\nsequestering and catastrophe promotion as mechanisms for MT growth inhibition\nby stathmin. For a homogeneous stathmin concentration in the absence of Rac1,\nwe find a switch-like regulation of the MT mean length by stathmin. For\nconstitutively active Rac1 at the cell edge, stathmin is deactivated locally,\nwhich establishes a spatial gradient of active stathmin. In this gradient, we\nfind a stationary bimodal MT length distributions for both mechanisms of MT\ngrowth inhibition by stathmin.

The combination of these physical models\naccurately fit the COS spectrum. Three intrinsic absorbers outflowing with\nvelocities ~500 km/s are identified, two of which are found directly from two\nvelocity components of the N V and C IV doublets, while the third is required\nby the extra absorption in the Lyman alpha. Their outflow velocities,\nionization states and column densities are consistent with the lowest and\nmoderately ionization warm absorbers (WAs) in the X-ray domain found by Chandra\nobservations, suggesting an one-to-one correspondence between the absorbing gas\nin the UV and X-ray bands. The small turbulent velocities of the WAs\n(v_turb~<100 km/s) support our previous argument from the X-ray study that the\nabsorbers originate from the inner side of the torus due to thermal\nevaporation. Given the covering fractions of ~65% for the three WAs, we deduce\nthat the lengths and the thicknesses of the WAs are comparable, which indicates\nthat the geometry of WAs are more likely clouds rather than flat and thin\nlayers.

Other\nthan most previously demonstrated variants of SPIDER, our method is based on a\nthird-order nonlinear optical effect, namely self-diffraction, rather than the\nsecond-order effect of sum-frequency generation. On one hand, self-diffraction\n(SD) substantially simplifies phase-matching capabilities for multi-octave\nspectra that cannot be hosted by second-order processes, given manufacturing\nlimitations of crystal lengths in the few-micrometer range. On the other hand,\nhowever, SD SPIDER imposes an additional constraint as it effectively measures\nthe spectral phase of a self-convolved spectrum rather than immediately\nmeasuring the fundamental phase. Reconstruction of the latter from the measured\nphase and the spectral amplitude of the fundamental turns out to be an\nill-posed problem, which we address by a regularization approach. We discuss\nthe numerical implementation in detail and apply it to measured data from a\nTi:sapphire amplifier system.

It has been hypothesized that fimbriae can, by their ability to\nuncoil under exposure to force, reduce fluid shear stress on the\nadhesin-receptor interaction by which the bacterium adheres to the surface. In\nthis work we develop a model that describes how the force on the\nadhesin-receptor interaction of a type 1 fimbriae varies as a bacterium is\naffected by a time dependent fluid flow mimicking in vivo conditions. The model\ncombines in vivo hydrodynamic conditions with previously assessed biomechanical\nproperties of the fimbriae. Numerical methods are used to solve for the motion\nand adhesion force under the presence of time dependent fluid profiles. It is\nfound that a bacterium tethered with a type 1 pilus will experience\nsignificantly reduced shear stress for moderate to high flow velocities and\nthat the maximum stress the adhesin will experience is limited to ~120 pN,\nwhich is sufficient to activate the conformational change of the FimH adhesin\ninto its stronger state but also lower than the force required for breaking it\nunder rapid loading. Our model thus supports the assumption that the type 1\nfimbriae shaft and the FimH adhesin-receptor interaction are optimized to each\nother, and that they give piliated bacteria significant advantages in rapidly\nchanging fluidic environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 14:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

A more refined definition is then\nconsidered, which takes into account issues of normality and typicality, which\nare well known to affect causal ascriptions. Causality is typically an\nall-or-nothing notion: either A is a cause of B or it is not. An extension of\nthe definition of causality to capture notions of degree of responsibility and\ndegree of blame, due to Chockler and Halpern, is reviewed. For example, if\nsomeone wins an election 11-0, then each person who votes for him is less\nresponsible for the victory than if he had won 6-5. Degree of blame takes into\naccount an agent's epistemic state. Roughly speaking, the degree of blame of A\nfor B is the expected degree of responsibility of A for B, taken over the\nepistemic state of an agent. Finally, the structural-equations definition of\ncausality is compared to Wright's NESS test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 14:58:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

While the notion of\nmost salient object is sensible when multiple objects exist in a scene, current\ndatasets for evaluation of saliency detection approaches often have scenes with\nonly one single object. We introduce three main contributions in this paper:\nFirst, we take an indepth look at the problem of salient object detection by\nstudying the relationship between where people look in scenes and what they\nchoose as the most salient object when they are explicitly asked. Based on the\nagreement between fixations and saliency judgments, we then suggest that the\nmost salient object is the one that attracts the highest fraction of fixations.\nSecond, we provide two new less biased benchmark datasets containing scenes\nwith multiple objects that challenge existing saliency models. Indeed, we\nobserved a severe drop in performance of 8 state-of-the-art models on our\ndatasets (40% to 70%). Third, we propose a very simple yet powerful model based\non superpixels to be used as a baseline for model evaluation and comparison.\nWhile on par with the best models on MSRA-5K dataset, our model wins over other\nmodels on our data highlighting a serious drawback of existing models, which is\nconvoluting the processes of locating the most salient object and its\nsegmentation. We also provide a review and statistical analysis of some labeled\nscene datasets that can be used for evaluating salient object detection models.\nWe believe that our work can greatly help remedy the over-fitting of models to\nexisting biased datasets and opens new venues for future research in this\nfast-evolving field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 23:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

When $\\epsilon\\to 0$, the velocity\nof the moving boundary $v$ in one dimension and that of the radius in the\ncylinder or sphere are shown as the following Stefan problem,\\\\ $$ \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{l} u_t-\\Delta u =0\\\\\\\\ \\displaystyle\nv=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n}\\right]_\\Gamma \\displaystyle\nu=-\\frac{m}{2\\ell}[\\kappa -\\alpha v]_\\Gamma \\end{array} \\right. $$ where\n$\\alpha$ is a positive parameter, $[\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n}]_\\Gamma$ is\nthe jump of the normal derivatives of $u$ (from solid to liquid), and\n$m=\\int_{-1}^1\\left(2W(\\varphi)\\right)^{1/2}d\\varphi$. Since it is sufficient\nto describe the phase transition of single component by the phase-field\nequation, we analyze the phase-field equation, and investigate whether the\nequation shows the Stefan problem or not. The velocity of the moving boundary\nin the cylinder and sphere are determined and the result of the simulation of\nthe equation is also presented. Next, we consider the velocity of interface\nwhich depends on the temperature. The control of width of diffusion layer by\nthe parameter of phase-field equations is investigated in order to realize the\nsingular limit of phase field equations by the numerical method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 07:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-11"}

The latter is related to the derivatives of Jacobi theta function\n$\\theta(z)$, a modular form of weight $1/2$. P\\'olya noticed that when $t$ goes\nto infinity, $e^t$ goes to $e^t+ e^{-t}=2\\cosh t$. He then approximated the\nkernel $\\Phi(t)$ by $\\Phi_{P}(t)$ that contained only the leading term and with\n$\\exp t,\\exp(9t/4)$ replaced by $2\\cosh t,2\\cos(9t/4)$. This procedure captured\nalmost all of the contribution from the tail part (i.e., $t\\to\\infty$) of the\nkernel $\\Phi(t)$.\n  We realize that when $t$ goes to infinity and $0\\leqslant b<1,c\\in\\R$, $\\cosh\nt+c \\cosh(bt)$ goes to $\\cosh t$. Thus we improve P\\'olya's approximation by\nreplacing $\\cosh(9t/4)$ with $\\cosh(9t/4)+b\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1}b_k \\cosh(9kt/(4m))$\nand adjusting the parameters $b,b_k,m$ such that (A) the approximated kernel\n$\\Phi_{S}(b,b_k,m;t)$ goes to $\\Phi(t)$when $t$ goes to infinity;(B)\n$\\Phi_{S}(b,b_k,m;t)$ is identical to $\\Phi(t)$ at $t=0$; (C) the Fourier\ntransform of $\\Phi_{S}(b,b_k,m;t)$,like in P\\'olya's case, has only real zeros.\nSince this procedure also captures almost all of the contribution from the head\npart (i.e., near $t=0$) of the kernel $\\Phi(t)$, we are able to anchor both\nends of the kernel $\\Phi(t)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 16:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

It is important to have a propitious\nsupervision to reduce the feeling of isolation in E-learning.
