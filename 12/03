This results in large amounts of highly redundant\ndata, which needs to be properly handled during encoding and transmission over\nresource-constrained channels. In this work, we study coding and transmission\nstrategies in multicamera systems, where correlated sources send data through a\nbottleneck channel to a central server, which eventually transmits views to\ndifferent interactive users. We propose a dynamic correlation-aware packet\nscheduling optimization under delay, bandwidth, and interactivity constraints.\nThe optimization relies both on a novel rate-distortion model, which captures\nthe importance of each view in the 3D scene reconstruction, and on an objective\nfunction that optimizes resources based on a client navigation model. The\nlatter takes into account the distortion experienced by interactive clients as\nwell as the distortion variations that might be observed by clients during\nmultiview navigation. We solve the scheduling problem with a novel\ntrellis-based solution, which permits to formally decompose the multivariate\noptimization problem thereby significantly reducing the computation complexity.\nSimulation results show the gain of the proposed algorithm compared to baseline\nscheduling policies. More in details, we show the gain offered by our dynamic\nscheduling policy compared to static camera allocation strategies and to\nschemes with constant coding strategies. Finally, we show that the best\nscheduling policy consistently adapts to the most likely user navigation path\nand that it minimizes distortion variations that can be very disturbing for\nusers in traditional navigation systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 16:02:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

The SINR diagram consists of\n$n$ regions where each transmitter can be heard and the remaining space where\nno one can be heard.\n  Efficient point location in the SINR diagram, i.e., building a data structure\nto determine, for a query point, whether any transmitter is heard there, and if\nso, which one, has been recently investigated. Previous such planar data\nstructures are constructed in time at least quadratic in $n$ and support\nlogarithmic-time approximate queries. Moreover, the performance of these\ndepends not only on the number $n$ of transmitters and on the approximation\nparameter $\\varepsilon$, but also on some geometric parameters that cannot be\nbounded a priori as a function of $n$ or $\\varepsilon$.\n  We address the question of batched point location queries, i.e., answering\nmany queries simultaneously. Specifically, in one dimension, we can answer $n$\nqueries exactly in amortized polylogarithmic time per query, while in the plane\nwe can do it approximately.\n  All these results can handle arbitrary power assignments to the transmitters.\nMoreover, the amortized query time in these results depends only on $n$ and\n$\\varepsilon$.\n  We also show how to speed up the preprocessing in a previously proposed\npoint-location structure in SINR diagram for uniform-power sites, by almost a\nfull order of magnitude. For this we obtain results on the sensitivity of the\nreception regions to slight changes in the reception threshold, which are of\nindependent interest.\n  Finally, these results demonstrate the (so far underutilized) power of\ncombining algebraic tools with those of computational geometry and other\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 16:20:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 02:14:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 20:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-11"}

Sub-grid modeling takes a novel\napproach for partial wetting and drying within grid cells, eschewing the\nconventional hydrodynamic modeling method by nesting a sub-grid containing\nhigh-resolution lidar topography and fine scale bathymetry within each\ncomputational grid cell. In doing so, the sub-grid modeling method is heavily\ndependent on building and street configuration provided by the DEM. The results\nof spatial comparisons between the sub-grid model and FEMA's maximum inundation\nextents in New York City yielded an unparalleled absolute mean distance\ndifference of 38m and an average of 75% areal spatial match. An in-depth error\nanalysis reveals that the modeled extent contour is well correlated with the\nFEMA extent contour in most areas, except in several distinct areas where\ndifferences in special features cause significant de-correlations between the\ntwo contours. Examples of these errors were found to be primarily attributed to\nlack of building representation in the New Jersey region of the model grid,\noccluded highway underpasses artificially blocking fluid flow, and DEM source\ndifferences between the model and FEMA. Accurate representation of these urban\ninfrastructural features is critical in terms of sub-grid modeling, because it\nuniquely affects the fluid flux through each grid cell side, which ultimately\ndetermines the water depth and extent of flooding via distribution of water\nvolume within each grid cell. Incorporation of buildings and highway\nunderpasses allow for the model to improve overall absolute mean distance error\nmetrics from 38m to 32m and area comparisons from 75% spatial match to 80% with\nminimal additional effort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 16:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

In general,\nthese models assume that hard process rates and the magnitude of the soft event\nactivity in the underlying $NN$ collisions is uncorrelated. When included,\nthese correlations influence the measured yield in a nominal centrality\ninterval, an effect typically referred to as a \"centrality bias\". In this work,\nthe impact of a positive correlation between the hard scattering yield and the\nunderlying event activity in individual $NN$ collisions is investigated. This\ncorrelation is incorporated into the centrality calculations used by ATLAS and\nPHENIX, both based on a similar Monte Carlo Glauber approach but with different\nmodels of the per-collision or per-participant event activity. It is found that\nthe presence of this correlation tends to increase the yield measured in more\ncentral events and decrease it in peripheral events.

One builds a local coordinate system in which\nspacetime is locally Minkowskian. However, due to the conformal nature of the\nRobertson-Walker metric the conventional transformation to the local inertial\ncoordinates introduces ambiguity in the physical interpretation of the local\ntime coordinate. Therefore, contrary to a common-sense expectation, a\nstraightforward implementation of EEP alone does not allow us to decide whether\natomic clocks ticks at the same rate as the clocks based on EM modes of a\ncavity. To resolve the ambiguity we analyzed the cavity rigidity and the\noscillation of its EM modes in an expanding universe by employing the Maxwell\nequations. We found out that both the size of the cavity and the EM frequency\nexperience an adiabatic drift in conformal coordinates as the universe expands.\nWe set up the oscillation equation for the EM modes, solve it by the WKB\napproximation, and reduce the coordinate-dependent quantities to their\ncounterparts measured by a local observer who counts time with atomic clock.\nThe solution shows that there is a perfect cancellation of the adiabatic drift\nof cavity's frequency by the transformation to local coordinates, and the time\ncounted by the clocks based on EM modes of cavity has the same rate as that of\natomic clocks. We conclude that there should be no cosmological drift of\nfrequency of a standing EM wave oscillating in the cavity resonator as compared\nto the frequency of atomic clocks.

For the most commonly studied cases,\nthe PN barrier for strongly localized solutions becomes large, rendering these\nessentially immobile. Several ways to improve the mobility by reducing the\nPN-barrier have been proposed during the last decade, and the first part gives\na brief review of such scenarios in 1D and 2D. We then proceed to discuss two\nrecently discovered novel mobility scenarios. The first example is the 2D\nKagome lattice, where the existence of a highly degenerate, flat linear band\nallows for a very small PN-barrier and mobility of highly localized modes in a\nsmall-power regime. The second example is a 1D waveguide array in an active\nmedium with intrinsic (saturable) gain and damping, where exponentially\nlocalized, travelling discrete dissipative solitons may exist as stable\nattractors. Finally, using the framework of an extended Bose-Hubbard model, we\nshow that while quantum fluctuations destroy the mobility of slowly moving,\nstrongly localized classical modes, coherent mobility of rapidly moving states\nsurvives even in a strongly quantum regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 17:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

It has been known since the seminal paper of\nPatterson (1950) that when the units are not allowed to return to the sample\nafter leaving it for certain period (there are no gaps in the rotation\npattern), one step recursion for optimal estimator holds. However, in some\nimportant real surveys, e.g. Current Population Survey in the US or Labour\nForce Survey in many countries in Europe, units return to the sample after\nbeing absent in the sample for several occasions (there are gaps in rotation\npatterns). In such situations difficulty of the question of the form of the\nrecurrence for optimal estimator increases drastically. This issue has not been\nresolved yet. Instead alternative sub-optimal approaches were developed, as\nK-composite estimation (see e.g. Hansen et al. (1955)), AK-composite estimation\n(see e.g. Gurney and Daly (1965) or time series approach (see e.g. Binder and\nHidiroglou (1988)).\n  In the present paper we overcome this long-standing difficulty, that is, we\npresent analytical recursion formulas for the optimal linear estimator of the\nmean for schemes with gaps in rotation patterns. It is achieved under some\ntechnical conditions: ASSUMPTION I and ASSUMPTION II (numerical experiments\nsuggest that these assumptions might be universally satisfied). To attain the\ngoal we develop an algebraic operator approach which allows to reduce the\nproblem of recursion for the optimal linear estimator to two issues: (1)\nlocalization of roots (possibly complex) of a polynomial Q_p defined in terms\nof the rotation pattern (Q_p happens to be conveniently expressed through\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind), (2) rank of a matrix S defined in\nterms of the rotation pattern and the roots of the polynomial Q_p.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 17:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

This contrasts with systems in which, for example,\ncharge-density-wave (CDW) order competes for Fermi surface area with\nsuperconductivity. La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ with $x=0.125$ provides an example\nin which the ordering of spin stripes coincides with the onset of\ntwo-dimensional superconducting correlations. The apparent frustration of the\ninterlayer Josephson coupling has motivated the concept of the\npair-density-wave superconductor, a state that theoretical calculations show to\nbe energetically competitive with the uniform $d$-wave superconductor. Even at\n$x=0.095$, where there is robust superconductivity below 32~K in zero field,\nthe coexistence of strong, low-energy, incommensurate spin excitations implies\na spatially modulated and intertwined pair wave function. Recent observations\nof CDW order in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ and other cuprate families have raised\ninteresting questions regarding the general role of charge modulations and the\nrelation to superconductivity. While there are differences in the doping\ndependence of the modulation wave vectors in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ and\nLa$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$, the maximum ordering strength is peaked at the hole\nconcentration of 1/8 in both cases. There are also possible connections with\nthe quantum oscillations that have been detected about the same hole\nconcentration but at high magnetic fields. Resolving these relationships\nremains a research challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 18:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

However, the\nsituation regarding non-asymptotic observers was never completely clear. Also,\nrecently a debate has sprung in the community as to what would infalling\nobservers perceive while crossing the horizon. We set out to settle this\nquestion and more at least semi-classically in the articles [arXiv:1304.2858]\nand [arXiv:1404.0684] with a fresh approach. We introduce a new set of\ncoordinates that are regular everywhere, consider the adiabatic expansion of\ndetector response and its link to the trajectory-dependent `effective'\ntemperature/s and also local invariant observables, energy density and flux,\nbuilt from renormalized stress energy tensor. This paper is a concise summary\nof the new procedure and the results obtained thereof.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 19:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-09"}

The contemporaneous variability of the broadband spectral\nenergy distribution is explored in the context of a simple synchrotron self\nCompton (SSC) model. In the SSC emission scenario, we find that the parameters\nrequired to represent the high state are significantly different than those in\nthe low state. Motivated by possible evidence of gas in the vicinity of the\nblazar, we also investigate a reflected-emission model to describe the observed\nvariability pattern. This model assumes that the non-thermal emission from the\njet is reflected by a nearby cloud of gas, allowing the reflected emission to\nre-enter the blob and produce an elevated gamma-ray state with no simultaneous\nelevated synchrotron flux. The model applied here, although not required to\nexplain the observed variability pattern, represents one possible scenario\nwhich can describe the observations. As applied to an elevated VHE state of 66%\nof the Crab Nebula flux, observed on a single night during the observation\nperiod, the reflected-emission scenario does not support a purely leptonic\nnon-thermal emission mechanism. The reflected emission model does, however,\npredict a reflected photon field with sufficient energy to enable elevated\ngamma-ray emission via pion production with protons of energies between 10 and\n100 TeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 19:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Based on a\ngeneralized Beth-Uhlenbeck approach to mesons and diquarks we present the\nthermodynamics of this system including the Mott dissociation of mesons and\ndiquarks at finite temperature. A striking result is the suppression of the\ndiquark abundance below the chiral restoration temperature by the coupling to\nthe Polyakov loop, because of their color degree of freedom. This is understood\nin close analogy to the suppression of quark distributions by the same\nmechanism. Mesons as color singlets are unaffected by the Polyakov-loop\nsuppression. At temperatures above the chiral restoration mesons and diquarks\nare both suppressed due to the Mott effect, whereby the positive resonance\ncontribution to the pressure is largely compensated by the negative scattering\ncontribution in accordance with the Levinson theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 19:54:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 17:25:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 11:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-08"}

These \"polynomial shift symmetries\" in turn protect\nthe technical naturalness of modes with a higher-order dispersion relation, and\nlead to a refinement of the proposed classification of infrared Gaussian fixed\npoints available to describe NG modes in nonrelativistic theories. Generic\ninteractions in such theories break the polynomial shift symmetry explicitly to\nthe constant shift. It is thus natural to ask: Given a Gaussian fixed point\nwith polynomial shift symmetry of degree $P$, what are the lowest-dimension\noperators that preserve this symmetry, and deform the theory into a\nself-interacting scalar field theory with the shift symmetry of degree $P$? To\nanswer this (essentially cohomological) question, we develop a new\ngraph-theoretical technique, and use it to prove several classification\ntheorems. First, in the special case of $P=1$ (essentially equivalent to\nGalileons), we reproduce the known Galileon $N$-point invariants, and find\ntheir novel interpretation in terms of graph theory, as an equal-weight sum\nover all labeled trees with $N$ vertices.

The baselines used ranged from 11 m to 129 m,\ncorresponding to a maximum resolution of 3mas (0.45 au at 150 pc).\n  Results : Thirteen disks are resolved well and the visibility curves are\nfully sampled as a function of baseline in the range 45-130 m for these 13\nobjects. A simple qualitative examination of visibility profiles allows us to\nidentify a rapid drop-off in the visibilities at short baselines in 8 resolved\ndisks. This is indicative of a significant contribution from an extended\ncontribution of light from the disk. We demonstrate that this component is\ncompatible with scattered light, providing strong support to a prediction made\nby Pinte et al. (2008). The amplitude of the drop-off and the amount of dust\nthermal emission changes from source to source suggesting that each disk is\ndifferent. A by-product of the survey is the identification of a new\nmilli-arcsec separation binary: WW Cha.

Just as electrons undergo Thomson scattering with photons, dark\nmatter particles may experience an analogous form of momentum exchange with\ndark energy. We investigate the influence such an interaction has on the\nformation of linear and nonlinear cosmic structure, by running for the first\ntime a suite of N-body simulations with different dark energy equations of\nstate and scattering cross sections. In models where the linear matter power\nspectrum is suppressed by the scattering, we find that on nonlinear scales the\npower spectrum is strongly enhanced. This is due to the friction term\nincreasing the efficiency of gravitational collapse, which also leads to a\nscale-independent amplification of the concentration and mass functions of\nhalos. The opposite trend is found for models characterised by an increase of\nthe linear matter power spectrum normalisation. More quantitatively, we find\nthat power spectrum deviations at nonlinear scales ($k \\approx 10\\, h/$Mpc) are\nroughly ten times larger than their linear counterparts, exceeding $100%$ for\nthe largest value of the scattering cross section considered in the present\nwork.

Molecular gas is the phase of\nthe interstellar medium from which stars form, so these outflows curtail\nstellar mass growth in galaxies. Previously known outflows, however, involve\nsmall fractions of the total molecular gas content and are restricted to\nsub-kiloparsec scales. It is also apparent that input from active galactic\nnuclei is in at least some cases dynamically important, so pure stellar\nfeedback has been considered incapable of aggressively terminating star\nformation on galactic scales. Extraplanar molecular gas has been detected in\nthe archetype starburst galaxy M82, but so far there has been no evidence that\nstarbursts can propel significant quantities of cold molecular gas to the same\ngalactocentric radius (~10 kpc) as the warmer gas traced by metal absorbers.\nHere we report observations of molecular gas in a compact (effective radius 100\npc) massive starburst galaxy at z=0.7, which is known to drive a fast outflow\nof ionized gas. We find that 35 per cent of the total molecular gas is\nspatially extended on a scale of approximately 10 kpc, and one third of this\nhas a velocity of up to 1000 km/s. The kinetic energy associated with this\nhigh-velocity component is consistent with the momentum flux available from\nstellar radiation pressure.

This mapping fixes the scaling\ndimension of the unparticle to be $d_U=d/2+\\sqrt{d^2+4}/2$ and ensures that the\ncorresponding propagator has zeros with $d$ the spacetime dimension of the\nunparticle field. The general {\\it dynamical} mechanism by which bulk\noperators, such as the Pauli term, couple to the scaling dimension of the\nboundary operator and thereby lead to a vanishing of the spectral weight at\nzero energy is reviewed in the context of unparticles and zeros. The analogue\nof the BCS gap equations with unparticles indicates that the transition\ntemperature increases as the attractive interaction strength decreases,\nindicating that unparticles are highly susceptible to a superconducting\ninstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 21:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

However, theoretical\ncalculations show that when particles reach the size for which the radial\nmigration is the fastest they tend to be accreted very efficiently by the star.\nThis is known as the radial-drift barrier. We explore the photophoresis in the\ninner regions of PPD as a possible mechanism for preventing the accretion of\nsolid bodies onto the star. Photophoresis is the thermal creep induced by the\nmomentum exchange of an illuminated solid particle with the surrounding gas.\nRecent laboratory experiments predict that photophoresis would be able to stop\nthe inward drift of macroscopic bodies (from 1 mm to 1 m in size). This extra\nforce has been included in our two-fluid (gas+dust) SPH code in order to study\nits efficiency. We show that the conditions of pressure and temperature\nencountered in the inner regions of PPD result in strong dynamical effects on\nthe dust particles due to photophoresis. Our simulations show that there is a\nradial and a vertical sorting of the dust grains according to their sizes and\ntheir intrinsic densities. Thus, our calculations support the fact that\nphotophoresis is a mechanism which can have a strong effect on the morphology\nof the inner regions of PPD, ultimately affecting the fate of planetesimals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 23:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-04"}

In the early 1970s it was expected that the\nstraightforward cubic time algorithm for MM will soon be accelerated to enable\nMM in nearly quadratic arithmetic time, with some far fetched implications.\nWhile pursuing this goal the mainstream research had its focus on the decrease\nof the classical exponent 3 of the complexity of MM towards its lower bound 2,\ndisregarding the growth of the input size required to support this decrease.\nEventually, surprising combinations of novel ideas and sophisticated techniques\nenabled the decrease of the exponent to its benchmark value of about 2.38, but\nthe supporting MM algorithms improved the straightforward one only for the\ninputs of immense sizes.

The corona took the low-ellipticity shape typical of solar\nmaximum (flattening index {\\epsilon} = 0.01), showing a change from the\ncomposite coronal images that we had observed and analyzed in this journal and\nelsewhere for the 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2010 eclipses. After crossing the\nnortheast Australian coast, the rest of the path of totality was over the\nocean, so further totality was seen only by shipborne observers. Our results\ninclude measurements of velocities of a coronal mass ejection; during the 36\nminutes of passage from the Queensland coast to a ship north of New Zealand, we\nfind a speed of 413 km/s, and we analyze its dynamics. We discuss the shapes\nand positions of several types of coronal features seen on our\nhigher-resolution composite Queensland images of the solar corona, including,\nmany helmet streamers, very faint bright and dark loops at the base of helmet\nstreamers, voids and radially oriented thin streamers.

Some old SNRs are seen primarily as\na result of a strong shock wave interacting with the ISM.

The most important breakthroughs in this\nfield are expected to arise from the high spectral resolution and sensitivity\nin the Fe-K band, combined with broad-band sensitivity over the full X-ray band\nand spectral capabilities also at lower energies. The sensitivity in the Fe-K\nregion allows to extend the absorption measure distribution of the outflow out\nto the highest ionisation states accessible, where observations with current\nX-ray missions indicate that most of the outflowing gas is to be found. Due to\nthe high-resolution and sensitivity it will also be able to give the definitive\nproof for the existence of ultra-fast outflows, and if so, characterise their\nphysical properties in great detail. These ultra-fast outflows carry very large\namounts of energy and momentum, and are of fundamental importance for feedback\nstudies.

The link to reflection and emission processes is\nalso discussed, as well as the possible relation between outflows and\nrelativistic emission lines.

In this work\nwe give a robust estimate of the number of visible JFCs with q<2.5 AU and\ndiameter D>2.3 km based on recent observational data.

We can simultaneously fit\nthe JFC inclination and semi-major axis distribution accurately with a delayed\npower law fading function and the maximum perihelion distance below which the\nobservational data is complete is q~2.3 AU.

The film is modeled as a fluid surface endowed with constant\ntension and the loop is modeled as an elastic rod resistant to both bending and\ntwist. The first and second energy variations of the underlying energy\nfunctional are derived, leading to governing equilibrium equations and\nstability criteria. The latter criteria are employed to explore the stability\nof flat circular configurations with respect to planar and transverse\nperturbations. Experiments are performed to study post-buckled configurations\nand to explore the validity of the theoretical predictions. Imparting a twist\nto the bounding loop destabilizes flat circular loops which are short-enough to\nbe stable when twist-free. Nevertheless, when the circular disk is perturbed\nmerely radially or merely transversely, the stability condition is indifferent\nto twist. By the equilibrium equations, the twisting angle of a planar\nequilibrium configuration should be distributed uniformly along the loop. The\nstability criteria guarantee that this uniformity is preserved after buckling.\nThe stability with respect to increasing the surface tension of the film or the\nlength of the loop is sensitive to the cross-sectional thickness of the\nbounding loop. However, stability with respect to increasing the total twist is\nindifferent to that thickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 06:31:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 07:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-17"}

Our\nearly work was based on a limited corpus of English travel literature to Greece\nin the 17 th century. This article deals with a late seventeenth century text\nwritten by a woman philosopher and essayist, Mary Astell (1666--1731),\nconsidered as one of the first English feminists. Astell wrote her essay at a\ntime in English history when women were \"the weaker vessel\" and their main\nbusiness in life was to charm and please men by their looks and submissiveness.\nIn this essay we will see how NooJ can help us analyse Astell's rhetoric (what\npoint of view does she adopt, does she speak in her own name, in the name of\nall women, what is her representation of men and women and their relationships\nin the text, what are the goals of education?). Then we will turn our attention\nto the morphology of words in the text and use NooJ commands and graphs to\ncarry out a lexicographic inquiry into Astell's lexemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 07:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-04"}

The developed environment\nis then used, to step by step imbed the physical language, used in Torsten\nEn{\\ss}lin's work, into a mathematical framework. Also a general approach for\nthe approximation of an evolution equation is given, serving as a base to\ndescribe the construction of a simulation scheme with IFD. Simulation errors in\nthe various steps are pointed out, to give an idea where inaccuracies come in\nand which steps therefore lead to the necessity of many degrees of freedom of\nthe signal and of many time steps within the simulation. In the end, IFD is\nillustrated in an example scenario. A matrix relation for the update steps of\nIFD is derived. It allows to simulate a data vector $d(T)$ which averages a\nKlein-Gordon field with one dimension in space and periodic over $[0,2\\pi)$.\nAlso a non-iterative equation for the direct computation of $d(T)$ from $d(0)$\nis constructed. This is reached by the fact that the original problem converts\ninto an ordinary differential equation for the data, if the simulation time\nsteps get infinitesimally small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 08:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-04"}

We focus on the case of linear programs (LPs) in dictionary form,\ngiven by $n$ equality constraints in $n+d$ variables, where the variables are\nconstrained to be nonnegative. A variable $x_r$ is called redundant, if after\nremoving $x_r \\geq 0$ the LP still has the same feasible region. The time\nneeded to solve such an LP is denoted by $LP(n,d)$.\n  It is easy to see that solving $n+d$ LPs of the above size is sufficient to\ndetect all redundancies. The currently fastest practical method is the one by\nClarkson: it solves $n+d$ linear programs, but each of them has at most $s$\nvariables, where $s$ is the number of nonredundant constraints.\n  In the first part we show that knowing all of the finitely many dictionaries\nof the LP is sufficient for the purpose of redundancy detection. A dictionary\nis a matrix that can be thought of as an enriched encoding of a vertex in the\nLP. Moreover - and this is the combinatorial aspect - it is enough to know only\nthe signs of the entries, the actual values do not matter. Concretely we show\nthat for any variable $x_r$ one can find a dictionary, such that its sign\npattern is either a redundancy or nonredundancy certificate for $x_r$.\n  In the second part we show that considering only the sign patterns of the\ndictionary, there is an output sensitive algorithm of running time\n$\\mathcal{O}(d \\cdot (n+d) \\cdot s^{d-1} \\cdot LP(s,d) + d \\cdot s^{d} \\cdot\nLP(n,d))$ to detect all redundancies. In the case where all constraints are in\ngeneral position, the running time is $\\mathcal{O}(s \\cdot LP(n,d) + (n+d)\n\\cdot LP(s,d))$, which is essentially the running time of the Clarkson method.\nOur algorithm extends naturally to a more general setting of arrangements of\noriented topological hyperplane arrangements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 09:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-04"}

The LCE\nproblem asks to preprocess a string into a compact data structure that supports\nfast LCE queries. In this paper we generalize the LCE problem to trees and\nsuggest a few applications of LCE in trees to tries and XML databases. Given a\nlabeled and rooted tree $T$ of size $n$, the goal is to preprocess $T$ into a\ncompact data structure that support the following LCE queries between subpaths\nand subtrees in $T$. Let $v_1$, $v_2$, $w_1$, and $w_2$ be nodes of $T$ such\nthat $w_1$ and $w_2$ are descendants of $v_1$ and $v_2$ respectively.\n\\begin{itemize} \\item $\\LCEPP(v_1, w_1, v_2, w_2)$: (path-path $\\LCE$) return\nthe longest common prefix of the paths $v_1 \\leadsto w_1$ and $v_2 \\leadsto\nw_2$. \\item $\\LCEPT(v_1, w_1, v_2)$: (path-tree $\\LCE$) return maximal\npath-path LCE of the path $v_1 \\leadsto w_1$ and any path from $v_2$ to a\ndescendant leaf. \\item $\\LCETT(v_1, v_2)$: (tree-tree $\\LCE$) return a maximal\npath-path LCE of any pair of paths from $v_1$ and $v_2$ to descendant leaves.\n\\end{itemize} We present the first non-trivial bounds for supporting these\nqueries.

Isoparametric finite elements are used to take into account\ncurved domain boundaries. The discrete pressure is defined on the primal\ntriangular grid and the discrete velocity field is defined on an edge-based\nstaggered dual grid. While staggered meshes are state of the art in classical\nfinite difference approximations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,\ntheir use in the context of high order DG schemes is novel and still quite\nrare. Formal substitution of the discrete momentum equation into the discrete\ncontinuity equation yields a sparse four-point block system for the scalar\npressure, which is conveniently solved with a matrix-free GMRES algorithm. A\nvery simple and efficient Picard iteration is then used in order to achieve\nhigh order of accuracy also in time, which is in general a non-trivial task in\nthe context of high order discretizations for the incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations. The flexibility and accuracy of high order space-time DG methods on\ncurved unstructured meshes allows to discretize even complex physical domains\nwith very coarse grids in both, space and time. The use of a staggered grid\nallows to avoid the use of Riemann solvers in several terms of the discrete\nequations and significantly reduces the total stencil size of the linear system\nthat needs to be solved for the pressure.

Indeed, when\nparameterized by $k := \\text{vc}(G_1)+\\text{vc}(G_2)$ the sum of the vertex\ncover number of the two input graphs, the problem was shown to be\nfixed-parameter tractable, with an algorithm running in time $2^{O(k \\log k)}$.\nWe complement this result by showing that, unless the ETH fails, it cannot be\nsolved in time $2^{o(k \\log k)}$. This kind of tight lower bound has been shown\nfor a few problems and parameters but, to the best of our knowledge, not for\nthe vertex cover number. We also show that MCIS does not have a polynomial\nkernel when parameterized by $k$, unless $NP \\subseteq \\mathsf{coNP}/poly$.\nFinally, we study MCIS and its connected variant MCCIS on some special graph\nclasses and with respect to other structural parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 10:28:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 18:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-23"}

We present the discovery of a gas-rich, star-forming galaxy at z = 2.48,\nthrough the detection of CO(1-0) line emission in the COLDz survey, through a\nsensitive, Ka-band (31 to 39 GHz) VLA survey of a 6.5 square arcminute region\nof the COSMOS field. We argue that the broad line (FWHM ~570 +/- 80 km/s) is\nmost likely to be CO(1-0) at z=2.48, as the integrated emission is spatially\ncoincident with an infrared-detected galaxy with a photometric redshift\nestimate of z = 3.2 +/- 0.4. The CO(1-0) line luminosity is L'_CO = (2.2 +/-\n0.3) x 10^{10} K km/s pc^2, suggesting a cold molecular gas mass of M_gas ~ (2\n- 8)x10^{10}M_solar depending on the assumed value of the molecular gas mass to\nCO luminosity ratio alpha_CO.

The\ninfrared to CO line luminosity ratio is ~114+/-19 L_solar/(K km/s pc^2),\nsimilar to galaxies with similar SFRs selected at UV/optical to radio\nwavelengths.

In particular, in each time slot, the EH node\ntransmits with either a constant desired power or remains silent if not enough\nenergy is available in its energy buffer.

Finally the authors concluded that the observed\nrelation is a universal fact in complex dynamical systems. Here, we test the\nproposed universal relation between skewness and kurtosis with large number of\nsynthetic data and show that in fact it is not universal and originates only\ndue to the small number of data points in the data sets considered. The\nproposed relation is tested using two different non-Gaussian distributions,\nnamely $q$-Gaussian and Levy distributions. We clearly show that this relation\ndisappears for sufficiently large data sets provided that the second moment of\nthe distribution is finite. We find that, contrary to the claims of Cristelli\n\\textit{et al.} regarding a power-law scaling regime, kurtosis saturates to a\nsingle value, which is of course different from the Gaussian case ($K=3$), as\nthe number of data is increased. On the other hand, if the second moment of the\ndistribution is infinite, then the kurtosis seems to never converge to a single\nvalue. The converged kurtosis value for the finite second moment distributions\nand the number of data points needed to reach this value depend on the\ndeviation of the original distribution from the Gaussian case. We also argue\nthat the use of kurtosis to compare distributions to decide which one deviates\nfrom the Gaussian more can lead to incorrect results even for finite second\nmoment distributions for small data sets, whereas it is totally misleading for\ninfinite second moment distributions where the difference depends on $N$ for\nall finite $N$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 12:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-04"}

The flows are forced at large scale and discretized on\nan isotropic grid of 2048^3 points. Stratification makes the flow anisotropic\nand introduces two extra characteristic scales with respect to homogeneous\nisotropic turbulence: the buoyancy scale, L_B, and the Ozmidov scale, l_{oz}.\nThe former is related to the number of layers that the flow develops in the\ndirection of gravity, the latter is regarded as the scale at which isotropy is\nrecovered. The values of L_B and l_{oz} depend on the Froude number and their\nabsolute and relative size affect the repartition of energy among Fourier\nmodes. By contrasting the behavior of the two simulated flows we identify some\nsurprising similarities: after an initial transient the two flows evolve\ntowards comparable values of the kinetic and potential enstrophy, and energy\ndissipation rate. Further similarities emerge at large scales: the same ratio\nbetween potential and total energy (~0.1) is spontaneously selected by the\nflows, and slow modes grow monotonically in both regimes causing a slow\nincrease of the total energy in time. The axisymmetric total energy spectrum\nshows a wide variety of spectral slopes as a function of the angle between the\nimposed stratification and the wave vector.

For this to occur, homologous genes need to\nfind and recognize each other. However, despite its central role in homologous\nrecombination, the mechanism of homology recognition is still an unsolved\npuzzle. While specific proteins are known to play a role at later stages of\nrecombination, an initial coarse grained recognition step has been proposed.\nThis relies on the sequence dependence of the DNA structural parameters, such\nas twist and rise, mediated by intermolecular interactions, in particular\nelectrostatic ones. In this proposed mechanism, sequences having the same base\npair text, or are homologous, have lower interaction energy than those\nsequences with uncorrelated base pair texts; the difference termed the\nrecognition energy. Here, we probe how the recognition energy changes when one\nDNA fragment slides past another, and consider, for the first time, homologous\nsequences in antiparallel alignment. This dependence on sliding was termed the\nrecognition well. We find that there is recognition well for anti-parallel,\nhomologous DNA tracts, but only a very shallow one, so that their interaction\nwill differ little from the interaction between two nonhomologous tracts. This\nfact may be utilized in single molecule experiments specially targeted to test\nthe theory.

INTRODUCTION Today,\nphotogrammetry and 3D modelling are an integral part of the methods used in\narcheology and heritage management. They provide answers to scientific needs in\nthe fields of conservation, preservation, restoration and mediation of\narchitectural, archaeological and cultural heritage [2] [6] [7] [9].\nPhotogrammetry on ceramic fragments was one of the first applications\ncontemporary of the development of this technique applied in the archaeological\ncommunity [3]. More recently and due to its democratization, it was applied\nmore generally to artifacts [5]. Finally joined today by the rise of 3D\nprinting [8] [10], it can restore fragmented artifacts [1] [12]. These examples\ntarget one or several particular objects and use different types of equipment\nthat can be expensive. These aspects can put off uninitiated archaeologists. So\nit would be appropriate to see if these techniques could be generalized to a\nwhole class of geometrically simple and common artifacts, such as ceramics.\nFrom these observations, associated to ceramics specialists with fragments of\nbroken ceramics, we aimed at arranging different tools and methods, including\nphotogrammetry, to explore opportunities for a cheap and attainable\nreconstruction methodology and its possible applications. Our first objective\nwas to establish a protocol for scanning fragments with photogrammetry, and for\nreconstruction of original ceramics.

Our approach is based on a generalization bound criterion for choosing\nthe task order that optimizes the average expected classification performance\nover all tasks.

Both sudden and\ntime-dependent quenches are analyzed in detail. For the case of interaction\nquenches we address the transition from the strong repulsive to the\nweakly-interacting regime, suppressing in this manner the heating of the\nsystem. The excitation modes such as the cradle process and the local breathing\nmode are examined via local density observables. In particular, the cradle mode\nis inherently related to the initial delocalization and, following a negative\ninteraction quench, can be excited only for incommensurate setups with filling\nlarger than unity. Alternatively, a negative quench of the lattice depth which\nfavors the spatial delocalization is used to access the cradle mode for setups\nwith filling smaller than unity.

The crucial step in frequent\npattern mining is frequency counting, which involves a matching operator to\nfind occurrences (instances) of a tree pattern in a given collection of trees.\nA widely used matching operator for tree-structured data is subtree\nhomeomorphism, where an edge in the tree pattern is mapped onto an\nancestor-descendant relationship in the given tree. Tree patterns that are\nfrequent under subtree homeomorphism are usually called embedded patterns. In\nthis paper, we present an efficient algorithm for subtree homeomorphism with\napplication to frequent pattern mining. We propose a compact data-structure,\ncalled occ, which stores only information about the rightmost paths of\noccurrences and hence can encode and represent several occurrences of a tree\npattern. We then define efficient join operations on the occ data-structure,\nwhich help us count occurrences of tree patterns according to occurrences of\ntheir proper subtrees. Based on the proposed subtree homeomorphism method, we\ndevelop an effective pattern mining algorithm, called TPMiner.

Here we relate a lesser-known cognitive bias, the \"outcome\norientation\", to medical questions and describe the harm that the outcome\norientation can do to medical research and practice. People who reason\naccording to an outcome orientation interpret probability as a subjective\ndegree of belief that is constrained to consider events one at a time, in a way\nthat is incompatible with Bayesian reasoning. Instead of accepting that\nuncertainty is inevitable, and generalizing from the frequency of similar\nevents, the outcome orientation prefers one-off causal narratives. In medicine,\nthe outcome orientation therefore erodes support for randomized controlled\ntrials in favor of reductionist approaches. The rhetoric of personalized\nmedicine resonates with, and can promote, the outcome orientation, by\nemphasizing how the measurable attributes of individual patients, rather than\nchance or unknowable factors, causally produce each particular patient's\noutcome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 23:06:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 18:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-20"}

Unary coding\ncan also be seen as spatial coding where the value of the number is determined\nby its place in an array. Motivated by biological finding that several neurons\nin the vicinity represent the same number, we propose a variant of unary\nnumeration in its spatial form, where each number is represented by several 1s.\nWe call this spread unary coding where the number of 1s used is the spread of\nthe code. Spread unary coding is associated with saturation of the Hamming\ndistance between code words.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 22:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-22"}

Within an irreducible unitary two-particle\nrepresentation of the Poincare group, the commutation relations of the Poincare\ngroup require that the two-particle states be momentum entangled. As in gauge\ntheories, momentum entanglement defines a correlation between two particles\nthat can be described as an interaction provided by the exchange of virtual\n(gauge) quanta. The coupling constant of this interaction is uniquely\ndetermined by the structure of the irreducible two-particle state space. For\ntwo massive spin one-half particles, the coupling constant matches the\nempirical value of the electromagnetic coupling constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 10:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In this study we propose a\nsimple method to enable systematic conversions between higher-order continuum\nand car-following models in two steps: equivalent transformations of variables\nbetween Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates, and finite difference\napproximations of first-order derivatives in Lagrangian coordinates. With the\nmethod, we derive higher-order continuum models from a number of well-known\ncar-following models. We also derive car-following models from higher-order\ncontinuum models. For general second-order models, we demonstrate that the\ncar-following and continuum formulations share the same fundamental diagram,\nbut the string stability condition of a car-following model is different from\nthe linear stability condition of a continuum model. This study reveals\nrelationships between many existing models and also leads to a number of new\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 23:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-26"}

In the case of dissipative motion, the action in the exponent of\nthe exponential probability is just the one proposed in a previous work (Q.A.\nWang, R.
