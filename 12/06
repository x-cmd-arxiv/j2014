Should the firm try to increase its\nreputation by making offers to higher-quality candidates, despite the risk that\nthe candidates might reject the offers and leave the firm empty-handed? Or\nshould it concentrate on weaker candidates who are more likely to accept the\noffer? The question acquires an added level of complexity once we take into\naccount the effect one hiring cycle has on the next: hiring better employees in\nthe current cycle increases the firm's reputation, which in turn increases its\nattractiveness for higher-quality candidates in the next hiring cycle. These\nconsiderations introduce an interesting temporal dynamic aspect to the rich\nline of research on matching models for job markets, in which long-range\nplanning and evolving reputational effects enter into the strategic decisions\nmade by competing firms.\n  We develop a model based on two competing firms to try capturing as cleanly\nas possible the elements that we believe constitute the strategic tension at\nthe core of the problem: the trade-off between short-term recruiting success\nand long-range reputation-building; the inefficiency that results from\nunderemployment of people who are not ranked highest; and the influence of\nearlier accidental outcomes on long-term reputations.\n  Our model exhibits all these phenomena in a stylized setting, governed by a\nparameter q that captures the difference in strength between the two top\ncandidates in each hiring cycle. We show that when q is relatively low the\nefficiency of the job market is improved by long-range reputational effects,\nbut when q is relatively high, taking future reputations into account can\nsometimes reduce the efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 16:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-08"}

We report the first detection in this source of HNCO, HNCS,\nHC3N and NO, with the IRAM-30m telescope in a sensitive mm-wavelength survey\ntowards this target. HNCO and HNCS are also first detections in CSEs. The\nobserved line profiles show that the emission arises in the massive central\ncomponent of the envelope and at the base of the fast lobes. The NO profiles\nare broader than those of HNCO, HNCS, and HC3N, and most importantly, broader\nthan the line profiles of 13CO. This indicates that the NO abundance is\nenhanced in the fast lobes relative to the slow, central parts. From LTE and\nnon-LTE excitation analysis, we estimate beam-average rotational temperatures\nof 15-30 K (and, maybe, up to 55 K for HC3N) and fractional abundances of\nX(HNCO)=[0.8-1]E-7, X(HNCS)=[0.9-1]E-8, X(HC3N)=[5-7]E-9 and X(NO)=[1-2]E-6.

We recall in it\nthe representation theory of finite groups and its link with structure\ncoefficients. We show also that the study of the structure coefficients of\ndouble-class algebras is related to the theory of Gelfand pairs and zonal\nspherical functions by giving, in the case of Gelfand pairs, a theorem similar\nto that of Frobenius which writes the structure coefficients of the\ndouble-class algebra associated to a Gelfand pair in terms of zonal spherical\nfunctions.

We give a combinatorial proof to the polynomiality property of\nthe structure coefficients of the Hecke algebra of the pair $(S_{2n},B_n)$ in\nthe third chapter.

In the\nfourth and last chapter we build a general framework which gives us the form of\nthe structure coefficients in the case of a sequence of double-class algebras.\nThis framework implies the polynomiality property of the structure coefficients\nof both the center of the symmetric group algebra and the Hecke algebra of\n$(S_{2n},B_n).$ In addition, we give a polynomiality property for the structure\ncoefficients of both the center of the hyperoctahedral group algebra and the\ndouble-class algebra of $diag(S_{n-1})$ in $S_n\\times S_{n-1}^{opp}.$\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 17:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-08"}

In these devices, data recording is controlled by a bipolar\nvoltage, which tunes electron localization length, thus resistivity, through\nelectron trapping/detrapping. The low-resistance state is a metallic state\nwhile the high-resistance state is an insulating state, as established by\nconductivity studies from 2K to 300K. The material is exemplified by a Si3N4\nthin film with randomly dispersed Pt or Cr. It has been extended to other\nmaterials, spanning a large library of oxide and nitride insulator films,\ndispersed with transition and main-group metal atoms. Nanometallic RRAMs have\nsuperior properties that set them apart from other RRAMs. The critical\nswitching voltage is independent of the film thickness/device\narea/temperature/switching speed. Trapped electrons are relaxed by\nelectron-phonon interaction, adding stability which enables long-term memory\nretention. As electron-phonon interaction is mechanically altered, trapped\nelectron can be destabilized, and sub-picosecond switching has been\ndemonstrated using an electromagnetically generated stress pulse. AC impedance\nspectroscopy confirms the resistance state is spatially uniform, providing a\ncapacitance that linearly scales with area and inversely scales with thickness.\nThe spatial uniformity is also manifested in outstanding uniformity of\nswitching properties. Device degradation, due to moisture, electrode oxidation\nand dielectrophoresis, is minimal when dense thin films are used or when a\nhermetic seal is provided. The potential for low power operation, multi-bit\nstorage and complementary stacking have been demonstrated in various RRAM\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 17:58:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-08"}

The baryonic component of the universe during this period is\nalmost entirely neutral hydrogen, which falls into local regions of higher dark\nmatter density. This seeds the formation of large-scale structures including\nthe cosmic web that we see today in the filamentary distribution of galaxies\nand clusters of galaxies. The only detectable signal from these dark ages is\nthe 21-cm spectral line of hydrogen, redshifted down to frequencies of\napproximately 10-100 MHz. Space-based observations of this signal will allow us\nto determine the formation epoch and physics of the first sources of ionizing\nradiation, and potentially detect evidence for the decay of dark matter\nparticles. JPL is developing deployable low frequency antenna and receiver\nprototypes to enable both all-sky spectral measurements of neutral hydrogen and\nultimately to map the spatial distribution of the signal as a function of\nredshift. Such observations must be done from space because of Earth's\nionosphere and ubiquitous radio interference. A specific application of these\ntechnologies is the Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE) mission. This small\nExplorer class mission is designed to measure the sky-averaged hydrogen signal\nfrom the shielded region above the far side of the Moon. These data will\ncomplement ground-based radio observations of the final stages of intergalactic\nre-ionization at higher frequencies.

However,\nthese algorithms require the assumption on the boundedness of the feasible set\nand their efficiency relies on the solutions of two involved subproblems. These\nhindered the applicability of these algorithms in solving large-scale and\nunconstrained optimization problems. In this paper, we first present a generic\nalgorithmic framework to extend these uniformly optimal level methods for\nsolving unconstrained problems.

As a result, the proposed FAPL and FUSL methods have\nimproved the performance of the APL and USL in practice significantly in terms\nof both computational time and solution quality.

We propose that these remarkable ALMA observations---which may bear\non how planetesimals form---reflect a gravitational global mode in the gas\ndisk. The mode is (1) fast---its pattern speed equals the disk's mean Keplerian\nfrequency; (2) of azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$, displacing the host star from the\nbarycenter; and (3) Toomre-stable. We solve for gas streamlines including the\nindirect stellar potential in the frame rotating with the pattern speed, under\nthe drastic simplification that gas does not feel its own gravity. Near\nco-rotation, the gas disk takes the form of a horseshoe-shaped annulus. Dust\nparticles with aerodynamic stopping times much shorter or much longer than the\norbital period are dragged by gas toward the horseshoe center. For intermediate\nstopping times, dust converges toward a $\\sim$45$^\\circ$-wide arc on the\nco-rotation circle. Particles that do not reach their final accumulation points\nwithin disk lifetimes, either because of gas turbulence or long particle drift\ntimes, conform to horseshoe-shaped gas streamlines.

RNMDP propagates Risk Notification Messages (RNMs) from\ntheir location of origin (called the Risk Zone) to vehicles approaching the\nRisk Zone. RNMDP assumes each node is aware of its current location in the\nnetwork. The protocol works as follows: A RNM is broadcast in the neighborhood\nof the Risk Zone. A node receiving the RNM from another node waits for a\nRebroadcast-Wait-Time before deciding to rebroadcast the message. The\nRebroadcast-Wait-Time for a node is modeled based on the ratio of the distance\nbetween the node and the immediate sender of the RNM and the direction of\nmovement of the node. Priority for rebroadcast is given for nodes farthest away\nfrom the sender and traveling towards the Risk Zone. Nodes that are traveling\nin lanes in direction away from the Risk Zone are also considered for\nrebroadcast, albeit with a larger Rebroadcast-Wait-Time. During the\nRebroadcast-Wait-Time, if a node hears the same RNM again rebroadcast in the\nneighborhood, then the node stops from further broadcasting the message. If a\nnode does not hear the RNM in its neighborhood during the RebroadcastWait-Time,\nthe node broadcasts the message in its neighborhood. A RNM is considered to\nhave been delivered to all the vehicles in the road, if the message reaches the\nTarget Zone. The performance of RNMDP has been compared with that of the\ncommonly used flooding strategy through extensive simulations conducted for\nhighway networks with different number of lanes and lane density. Simulation\nresults indicate that with a slightly larger delay (i.e., no more than 35% of\nthe delay incurred for flooding), RNMDP can achieve the same message delivery\nratio attained by flooding, but at a relatively much lower energy loss compared\nto flooding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 22:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-09"}

Al- though\ncensuses are useful resources for mathematicians, constructing them is\ndifficult: the best algorithms to date have not gone beyond n = 12. The\nunderlying algorithms essentially (i) enumerate all relevant 4-regular\nmultigraphs on n nodes, and then (ii) for each multigraph G they enumerate\npossible 3-manifold triangulations with G as their dual 1-skeleton, of which\nthere could be exponentially many. In practice, a small number of multigraphs\noften dominate the running times of census algorithms: for example, in a\ntypical census on 10 tetrahedra, almost half of the running time is spent on\njust 0.3% of the graphs.\n  Here we present a new algorithm for stage (ii), which is the computational\nbottleneck in this process. The key idea is to build triangulations by\nrecursively constructing neighbourhoods of edges, in contrast to traditional\nalgorithms which recursively glue together pairs of tetrahedron faces. We\nimplement this algorithm, and find experimentally that whilst the overall\nperformance is mixed, the new algorithm runs significantly faster on those\n\"pathological\" multigraphs for which existing methods are extremely slow. In\nthis way the old and new algorithms complement one another, and together can\nyield significant performance improvements over either method alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 22:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-10"}

This is reflected in the Standard Model\nof physics by requiring all particles and fields to be invariant under Lorentz\ntransformations. The most well-known test of this important cornerstone of\nphysics are Michelson-Morley-type experiments\\cite{MM, Herrmann2009,Eisele2009}\nverifying the isotropy of the speed of light. Lorentz symmetry also implies\nthat the kinetic energy of an electron should be independent of the direction\nof its velocity, \\textit{i.e.,} its dispersion relation should be isotropic in\nspace. In this work, we search for violation of Lorentz symmetry for electrons\nby performing an electronic analogue of a Michelson-Morley experiment. We split\nan electron-wavepacket bound inside a calcium ion into two parts with different\norientations and recombine them after a time evolution of 95ms. As the Earth\nrotates, the absolute spatial orientation of the wavepackets changes and\nanisotropies in the electron dispersion would modify the phase of the\ninterference signal. To remove noise, we prepare a pair of ions in a\ndecoherence-free subspace, thereby rejecting magnetic field fluctuations common\nto both ions\\cite{Roos2006}.

In the recent\nliterature, specific noise distributions have been considered and\ncorrespondingly, optimal denoising techniques have been developed. One of the\nsuccessful approaches for denoising relies on the notion of unbiased risk\nestimation, which enables one to obtain a useful substitute for the mean-square\nerror. For the case of additive white Gaussian noise contamination, the risk\nestimation procedure relies on Stein's lemma. Sophisticated wavelet-based\ndenoising techniques, which are essentially nonlinear, have been developed with\nthe help of the lemma. We show that, for linear, shift-invariant denoisers, it\nis possible to obtain unbiased risk estimates of the mean-square error without\nusing Stein's lemma. An interesting consequence of this development is that the\nunbiased risk estimator becomes agnostic to the statistical distribution of the\nnoise. As a proof of principle, we show how the new methodology can be used to\noptimize the parameters of a simple Gaussian smoother. By locally adapting the\nparameters of the Gaussian smoother, we obtain a shift-variant smoother, which\nhas a denoising performance (quantified by the improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)) that is competitive to far more sophisticated\nmethods reported in the literature.

The Li atoms present in the\nthin film are optically pumped to one of the ground hyperfine energy levels so\nthat they can no more absorb light from the resonant light source. Now in\npresence of a RF signal, which quantifies the ambient magnetic field, this\npolarized atomic system is again randomized thus making it reabsorb the\nresonant light. This gives a quantified measurement of the magnetic field\nsurrounding the thin film detector. This is then mapped to the presence of\nmagnetic HEM and hence the HEM are detected. Our approach in this regard starts\nwith verifying the stability of Lithium atoms in various solvents so as to get\na suitable liquid medium to form a thin film. In this regard, various\nUV-visible characterization spectra are presented to finally approach a stable\nsystem for the detection. We have worked on around 10 polar and non- polar\nsolvents to see the stability criteria. UV-Vis probe has been found to be quite\neffective in addressing issue of hosting Lithium atoms by various solvents.\nFurther results on the atomic system size as dispersed in the various solvents\nare presented. Atomic system size gives us a good quantitative estimate of the\ndensity of Lithium dispersed system in the thin film. Finally a separate atomic\nsystem under Ultrahigh vacuum is presented to achieve optical pumping wherein\nthe polarization and depolarization of atomic system is seen using a 670 nm\ndiode laser system which is electronically locked using a double window Hollow\ncathode lamp. These both systems will finally be combined together to give the\nfinal form to the detection system. As this whole system measures relative\nchange in magnetic field due to the presence of HEM,it gives a more reliable\nand accurate detection method compared to the absolute measurement detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Dec 2014 05:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

Although\nthis scaling is mathematically admitted as a unique symmetry transformation by\nthe underlying statistical equations for incompressible Navier-Stokes\nturbulence on the level of the functional Hopf equation, by closer inspection,\nhowever, it leads to physical inconsistencies and erroneous conclusions in the\ntheory of turbulence. The new statistical symmetry is thus misleading in so far\nas it forms within an unmodelled theory an analytical result which at the same\ntime lacks physical consistency. Our investigation will expose this\ninconsistency on different levels of statistical description, where on each\nlevel we will gain new insights for its non-physical transformation behavior.\nWith a view to generate invariant turbulent scaling laws, the consequences will\nbe finally discussed when trying to analytically exploit such a symmetry.

The contradiction\nis an \"equation\" $1/2 = 0$ with its two sides representing probabilities.\nUnlike known paradoxes in mathematics, the revealed contradiction cannot be\nexplained away and actually indicates that measure-theoretic probability is\ninconsistent. Appearing only in the theory, the contradiction does not exist in\nthe physical world. So practical applications of measure-theoretic probability\nwill not be affected by the inconsistency as long as \"ideal events\" in the\ntheory (which will never occur physically) are not mistaken for real events in\nthe physical world. Nevertheless, the inconsistency must be resolved.\nConstructive mathematics can avoid such inconsistency.

In contrast to spin-dependent WIMP scattering, the\nspin-independent channel, at the one-body level, is less sensitive to nuclear\nstructure details. In addition, we explicitly show that the structure factors\nfor inelastic scattering are suppressed by ~ 10^{-4} compared to the coherent\nelastic scattering response.

We choose the Flow-Oriented Routing protocol\n(FORP), Min-Max Battery Cost Routing (MMBCR) and the traffic interference based\nLoad Balancing Routing (LBR) protocol as representatives of the stability-based\nrouting, poweraware routing and load-balancing routing protocols respectively.\nFORP incurs the least number of route transitions; while LBR incurs the\nsmallest hop count and lowest end-to-end delay per data packet. Energy consumed\nper data packet is the least for LBR, closely followed by MMBCR. FORP incurs\nthe maximum energy consumed per data packet, both in the absence and presence\nof power control. Nevertheless, in the presence of power control, the\nend-to-end delay per data packet and energy consumed per data packet incurred\nby FORP are significantly reduced compared to the scenario without power\ncontrol. MMBCR is the most fair in terms of node usage and incurs the largest\ntime for first node failure. FORP tends to repeatedly use nodes lying on the\nstable path and hence is the most unfair of the three routing protocols. FORP\nalso incurs the smallest value for the time of first node failure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 21:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

We prove that for any \"polynomial\" worldline\nthe induced collective dynamics of the system of R-C particles obeys a whole\nset of canonical conservation laws (for total momentum, angular momentum and\nthe analogue of mechanical energy). Explicit formulas for the values of total\nangular momentum and the analogue of total rest energy (rest mass) are\nobtained; the latter is \"self-quantized\", i.e. for any worldline takes only\ninteger values. The dynamics is Lorentz invariant though different from the\ncanonical relativistic mechanics. Asymptotically, at large values of the\nobserver's proper time, the R-C particles gather themselves into pairs and then\nassemble into compact incoming/outgoing clusters. As a whole, the evolution\nresembles the process of (either elastic or inelastic) scattering of a beam of\ncomposite particles.
