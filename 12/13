The reshuffling itself is specified as a distribution\npolicy. We introduce a correctness condition, called parallel-correctness, for\nthe evaluation of queries w.r.t. a distribution policy. We study the complexity\nof parallel-correctness for conjunctive queries as well as transferability of\nparallel-correctness between queries.

But\nmagnetoresistance can also be a powerful probe of electronic and magnetic\ninteractions in matter. For example, magnetoresistance can be used to analyze\nmultiband conductivity, conduction inhomogeneity, localized magnetic moments,\nand (fractional) Landau level structure. For materials with strong spin-orbit\ninteraction, magnetoresistance can be used as a probe for weak antilocalization\nor a nontrivial Berry phase, such as in topological insulator surface states.\nFor the three dimensional topological insulators a large and linear\nmagnetoresistance is often used as indication for underlying non-trivial\ntopology, although the origin of this effect has not yet been established.\nHere, we observe a large magnetoresistance in the conducting bulk state of\nBi$_2$Te$_3$. We show that this type of large magnetoresistance is due to the\ncompetition between helical spin-momentum locking (i.e. spin rotates with\nmomentum direction) and the unidirectional spin alignment by an applied\nmagnetic field.

This\nquestion is at the heart of solid state NMR. There, an initially local\npolarization spreads all over due to spin-spin interactions that conserve the\ntotal spin projection, leading to an equilibration of the polarization. In\nprinciple, this quantum dynamics can be reversed by changing the sign of the\nHamiltonian. However, the reversal is usually perturbed by non reversible\ninteractions that act as a decoherence source. The fraction of the local\nexcitation recovered defines the Loschmidt echo (LE), here evaluated in a\nseries of closed $N$ spin systems with all-to-all interactions. The most\nremarkable regime of the LE decay occurs when the perturbation induces\nproliferated effective interactions. We show that if this perturbation exceeds\nsome lower bound, the decay is ruled by an effective Fermi golden rule (FGR).\nSuch a lower bound shrinks as $ N $ increases, becoming the leading mechanism\nfor LE decay in the thermodynamic limit.

This is based\non the difference of the parsimony scores of a single character on both trees\nunder consideration, and the goal is to find the character which maximizes this\ndifference. Here we show that computation of MP distance on two \\emph{binary}\nphylogenetic trees is NP-hard. This is a highly nontrivial extension of an\nearlier NP-hardness proof for two multifurcating phylogenetic trees, and it is\nparticularly relevant given the prominence of binary trees in the phylogenetics\nliterature. As a corollary to the main hardness result we show that computation\nof MP distance is also hard on binary trees if the number of states available\nis bounded. In fact, via a different reduction we show that it is hard even if\nonly two states are available. Finally, as a first response to this hardness we\ngive a simple Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation which is capable of\ncomputing the MP distance exactly for small trees (and for larger trees when\nonly a small number of character states are available) and which is used to\ncomputationally verify several auxiliary results required by the hardness\nproofs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 18:24:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Jan 2015 09:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-20"}

For closed curves, the affine transport equation defines\na \"generalized holonomy\" that takes the form of an affine map on the tangent\nspace.

These quantities are measured in datasets\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 27.8 nb$^{-1}$ and 4.0 pb$^{-1}$,\nrespectively, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in\n2013. The $p$+Pb collision centrality was characterised using the total\ntransverse energy measured in the pseudorapidity interval $-4.9 < \\eta < -3.2$\nin the direction of the lead beam. Results are presented for the\ndouble-differential per-collision yields as a function of jet rapidity and\ntransverse momentum ($p_\\mathrm{T}$) for minimum-bias and centrality-selected\n$p$+Pb collisions, and are compared to the jet rate from the geometric\nexpectation. The total jet yield in minimum-bias events is slightly enhanced\nabove the expectation in a $p_\\mathrm{T}$-dependent manner but is consistent\nwith the expectation within uncertainties. The ratios of jet spectra from\ndifferent centrality selections show a strong modification of jet production at\nall $p_\\mathrm{T}$ at forward rapidities and for large $p_\\mathrm{T}$ at\nmid-rapidity, which manifests as a suppression of the jet yield in central\nevents and an enhancement in peripheral events. These effects imply that the\nfactorisation between hard and soft processes is violated at an unexpected\nlevel in proton-nucleus collisions. Furthermore, the modifications at forward\nrapidities are found to be a function of the total jet energy only, implying\nthat the violations may have a simple dependence on the hard parton-parton\nkinematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 19:23:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 17:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-27"}

We give a simple\ngeometric understanding that allows us to learn a simplicial structure\nefficiently. Our method requires that the data are unit normalized (and thus\nlie on the unit sphere). We show that under this restriction, building a model\nwith simplices amounts to constructing a convex hull inside the sphere whose\nboundary facets is close to the data.

While the total number of\nbases used to build the simplices is a parameter of the model, the dimensions\nof the individual activated simplices are learned from the data.

These include the finite\nthickness of the layers, the nonlocal properties of the constituent metals, and\nlocal-field corrections associated with an emitter's dielectric environment. In\nparticular, we show that the corresponding effects are non-additive and lead to\nconsiderable modifications of an emitter's luminescence properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 20:48:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 18:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

However, the\ndependence of light curves on energy has not been studied for the high energy\nbands. In this paper we consider the bursts observed by Fermi LAT from 2008\nAugust 4 to 2011 August 1, for which at least $10$ photons were observed with\nthe energy greater than $1\\,\\text{GeV}$. These include $4$ bursts: GRB 080916C,\nGRB 090510, GRB 090902B, and GRB 090926A. We use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to\ncompare the light curves in the two bands, $100\\,\\text{MeV} < E <\n1\\,\\text{GeV}$ and $E > 1\\,\\text{GeV}$. For GRB 080916C and GRB 090510 the\nlight curves in the two bands are statistically compatible. However, for GRB\n090926A, the higher-energy light curve is stretched compared to the\nlower-energy one with a statistical significance of $3.3 \\sigma$ and, for GRB\n090902B, on the contrary, the lower-energy curve is stretched with $2.3 \\sigma$\nsignificance. We argue that the observed diversity of stretching factors may be\nexplained in a simple geometrical model. The model assumes that the jet opening\nangle depends on the emission energy in a way that the most energetic photons\nare radiated near the axis of the jet. All the bursts are considered equivalent\nin their rest frames and the observed light curves differ only due to different\nredshifts and view directions. The model conforms to the total burst energy\nconstraint and matches the Fermi LAT observations of the fraction of GRBs\nvisible in $100\\,\\text{MeV} < E < 1\\,\\text{GeV}$ band, which may be observed at\nhigher energies. The model predicts the distribution of observable stretching\nfactors, which may be tested in the future data. Finally, we propose a method\nto estimate observer's off-axis angle based on the stretching factor and the\nfraction of the high-energy photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 20:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

One such foundation\nis Lorentz symmetry, which can be broken in the gravitational sector by the\nexistence of a preferred time direction, and thus, a preferred frame at each\nspacetime point. This leads to a modification in the orbital decay rate of\nbinary systems, and also in the generation and chirping of their associated\ngravitational waves. We here study whether waves emitted in the late,\nquasi-circular inspiral of non-spinning, neutron star binaries can place\ncompetitive constraints on two proxies of gravitational Lorentz-violation:\nEinstein-\\AE{}ther theory and khronometric gravity. We model the waves in the\nsmall-coupling (or decoupling) limit and in the post-Newtonian approximation,\nby perturbatively solving the field equations in small deformations from\nGeneral Relativity and in the small-velocity/weak-gravity approximation. We\nassume a gravitational wave consistent with General Relativity has been\ndetected with second- and third-generation, ground-based detectors, and with\nthe proposed space-based mission, DECIGO, with and without coincident\nelectromagnetic counterparts. Without a counterpart, a detection consistent\nwith General Relativity of neutron star binaries can only place competitive\nconstraints on gravitational Lorentz violation when using future,\nthird-generation or space-based instruments. On the other hand, a single\ncounterpart is enough to place constraints that are 10 orders of magnitude more\nstringent than current binary pulsar bounds, even when using second-generation\ndetectors. This is because Lorentz violation forces the group velocity of\ngravitational waves to be different from that of light, and this difference can\nbe very accurately constrained with coincident observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 21:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Many approaches have been developed to better estimate the\ncardiac muscle deformation, and to obtain a practical model to be used in\ndiagnostic procedures. But there are some conditions, like in case of\nmyocardial infarction, in which the regular modeling approaches are not useful.\nIn this article, using a point-wise approach, we try to estimate the\ndeformation under some abnormal conditions of cardiac muscle. First, the\nendocardial and epicardial contour points are ordered with respect to the\ncenter of gravity of the endocardial contour and displacement vectors of\nboundary points are extracted. Then to solve the governing equations of the\ndeformation, which is an elliptic equation, we apply boundary conditions in\naccordance with the computed displacement vectors and then the Finite Element\nmethod (FEM) will be used to solve the governing equations. Using the obtained\ndisplacement field of the cardiac muscle, strain map is extracted to show the\nmechanical behavior of the cardiac muscle. Several tests are conducted using\nphantom and real cardiac data in order to show the validity of the proposed\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 04:49:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 22:24:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 04:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-01"}

Inspired by the observation that the homographies of correct\nfeature correspondences vary smoothly along the spatial domain, our approach\nstands on the unsupervised nature of feature matching, and can select a good\ndescriptor for matching each feature point. Specifically, the homography space\nserves as the common domain, in which a correspondence obtained by any\ndescriptor is considered as a point, for integrating various heterogeneous\ndescriptors. Both geometric coherence and spatial continuity among\ncorrespondences are considered via computing their geodesic distances in the\nspace. In this way, mutual verification across different descriptors is\nallowed, and correct correspondences will be highlighted with a high degree of\nconsistency (i.e., short geodesic distances here). It follows that one-class\nSVM can be applied to identifying these correct correspondences, and boosts the\nperformance of feature matching.

The framework, aimed at seamlessly generalizing error\nbackpropagation to the deterministic spiking neuron setting, is based strictly\non spike timing and avoids invoking concepts pertaining to spike rates or\nprobabilistic models of spiking. The derivation is founded on two innovations.\nFirst, an error functional is proposed that compares the spike train emitted by\nthe output neuron of the network to the desired spike train by way of their\nputative impact on a virtual postsynaptic neuron. This formulation sidesteps\nthe need for spike alignment and leads to closed form solutions for all\nquantities of interest.

The observations, between approximately 1 and 10 GHz\nover three epochs spanning approximately 21 months, reveal variability both\nabove the spectral peak at ~3 GHz and below the peak. The combination of the\nlow and high frequency variability cannot be easily explained using a single\nabsorption mechanism, such as free-free absorption or synchrotron\nself-absorption. We find that the PKS 1718-649 spectrum and its variability are\nbest explained by variations in the free-free optical depth on our\nline-of-sight to the radio source at low frequencies (below the spectral peak)\nand the adiabatic expansion of the radio source itself at high frequencies\n(above the spectral peak). The optical depth variations are found to be\nplausible when X-ray continuum absorption variability seen in samples of Active\nGalactic Nuclei is considered. We find that the cause of the peaked spectrum in\nPKS 1718-649 is most likely due to free-free absorption. In agreement with\nprevious studies, we find that the spectrum at each epoch of observation is\nbest fit by a free-free absorption model characterised by a power-law\ndistribution of free-free absorbing clouds. This agreement is extended to\nfrequencies below the 1 GHz lower limit of the ATCA by considering new\nobservations with Parkes at 725 MHz and 199 MHz observations with the newly\noperational Murchison Widefield Array. These lower frequency observations argue\nagainst families of absorption models (both free-free and synchrotron\nself-absorption) that are based on simple homogenous structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 10:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

When the system is\ndescribed by a connected network of N components (nodes) and their L connection\n(links), the reliability of the system becomes a difficult network design\nproblem which solutions are of great practical interest in science and\nengineering. This paper discusses the numerical method of finding the most\nreliable network for a given N and L using genetic algorithm. For a given\ntopology of the network, the reliability is numerically computed using\nadjacency matrix. For a search in the space of all possible topologies of the\nconnected network with N nodes and L links, genetic operators such as mutation\nand crossover are applied to the adjacency matrix through a string\nrepresentation. In the context of graphs, the mutation of strings in genetic\nalgorithm corresponds to the rewiring of graphs, while crossover corresponds to\nthe interchange of the sub-graphs. For small networks where the most reliable\nnetwork can be found by exhaustive search, genetic algorithm is very efficient.\nFor larger networks, our results not only demonstrate the efficiency of our\nalgorithm, but also suggest that the most reliable network will have high\nsymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 10:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}

We construct a two-dimensional,\nsingle phase model for the steady-state mean grain size beneath a mid-ocean\nridge. The mantle rheology is modelled as a composite of diffusion creep,\ndislocation creep, dislocation accommodated grain boundary sliding, and a\nplastic stress limiter. The mean grain size is calculated by the piezometric\nrelationship of Austin and Evans [2007]. We investigate the sensitivity of our\nmodel to global variations in grain growth exponent, potential temperature,\nspreading-rate, and mantle hydration. We interpret the mean mean grain-size\nfield in the context of permeability. The permeability structure due to mean\ngrain size may be approximated as a high permeability region beneath a low\npermeability region. The transition between high and low permeability regions\nforms a boundary that is steeply sloped toward the ridge axis. We hypothesise\nthat such a permeability structure generated from the variability of the mean\ngrain size may be able to focus melt towards the ridge axis, analogous to a\nSparks and Parmentier [1991]-type focusing. This focusing may, in turn,\nconstrain the region where significant melt fractions are observed by seismic\nor magnetotelluric surveys. This interpretation of melt focusing via the\ngrain-size permeability structure is consistent with MT observation of the\nasthenosphere beneath the East Pacific Rise [Baba et al., 2006, Key et al.,\n2013].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 12:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The magnetic field lies in the in-plane\ndirection x, the direction required for a coherent hole spin. The electrical\nfield lies along the growth direction z and is changed over a large range, 100\nkV/cm. Both electron and hole g-factors are determined by high resolution laser\nspectroscopy with resonance fluorescence detection. This, along with the low\nelectrical-noise environment, gives very high quality experimental results. The\nhole g-factor g_xh depends linearly on the electric field Fz, dg_xh/dFz = (8.3\n+/- 1.2)* 10^-4 cm/kV, whereas the electron g-factor g_xe is independent of\nelectric field, dg_xe/dFz = (0.1 +/- 0.3)* 10^-4 cm/kV (results averaged over a\nnumber of quantum dots). The dependence of g_xh on Fz is well reproduced by a\n4x4 k.p model demonstrating that the electric field sensitivity arises from a\ncombination of soft hole confining potential, an In concentration gradient and\na strong dependence of material parameters on In concentration. The electric\nfield sensitivity of the hole spin can be exploited for electrically-driven\nhole spin rotations via the g-tensor modulation technique and based on these\nresults, a hole spin coupling as large as ~ 1 GHz is expected to be envisaged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 14:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The strength of the gravitational\nconstant is $G=G_N(1+\\alpha)$ where $\\alpha$ is a parameter. A regular\nsingularity-free MOG solution is derived using a nonlinear field dynamics for\nthe repulsive gravitational field component and a reasonable physical\nenergy-momentum tensor. The Kruskal-Szekeres completion of the MOG black hole\nsolution is obtained. The Kerr-MOG black hole solution is determined by the\nmass $M$, the parameter $\\alpha$ and the spin angular momentum $J=Ma$. The\nequations of motion and the stability condition of a test particle orbiting the\nMOG black hole are derived, and the radius of the black hole photosphere and\nthe shadows cast by the Schwarzschild-MOG and Kerr-MOG black holes are\ncalculated. A traversable wormhole solution is constructed with a throat\nstabilized by the repulsive component of the gravitational field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 23:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2015 18:46:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 18:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

Seriation is thus\ninherently a problem of finding the optimal solution among a set of\npermutations of objects. In this short technical note, we review the\ncombinatorial structure of the classical seriation problem, which seeks a\nsingle solution out of a set of objects. We then extend those results to the\niterative frequency seriation approach introduced by Lipo (1997), which finds\noptimal subsets of objects which each satisfy the unimodality criterion within\neach subset. The number of possible solutions across multiple solution subsets\nis larger than $n!$, which underscores the need to find new algorithms and\nheuristics to assist in the deterministic frequency seriation problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 00:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-19"}
