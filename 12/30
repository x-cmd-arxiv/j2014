The latter allows us to give a time-domain\ntheory of superradiant reflection. The boundedness of the scattering matrix\nshows in particular that the maximal amplification of solutions associated to\ningoing finite-energy wave packets on past null infinity is bounded. On the\nfrequency side, this corresponds to the novel statement that the suitably\nnormalised reflection and transmission coefficients are uniformly bounded\nindependently of the frequency parameters. We further complement this with a\ndemonstration that superradiant reflection indeed amplifies the energy radiated\nto future null infinity of suitable wave-packets as above.

Because the reference test mass\nis contained within the same spacecraft, it is necessary to apply forces on it\nto maintain its position and attitude relative to the spacecraft. These forces\nare a potential source of acceleration noise in the LISA Pathfinder system that\nare not present in the full LISA configuration.

Many such processes are ongoing,\nalthough event sequences are only available during a finite observation window.\nBecause the observation time window is more likely to begin or end during long\nIETs than during short ones, the analysis of such data is susceptible to a bias\ninduced by the finite observation period. In this paper, we illustrate how this\nlength bias is born and how it can be corrected without assuming any particular\nshape for the IET distribution. To do this, we model event sequences using\nstationary renewal processes, and we formulate simple heuristics for\ndetermining the severity of the bias. To illustrate our results, we focus on\nthe example of empirical communication networks, which are temporal networks\nthat are constructed from communication events. The IET distributions of such\nsystems guide efforts to build models of human behavior, and the variance of\nIETs is very important for estimating the spreading rate of information in\nnetworks of temporal interactions. We analyze several well-known data sets from\nthe literature, and we find that the resulting bias can lead to systematic\nunderestimates of the variance in the IET distributions and that correcting for\nthe bias can lead to qualitatively different results for the tails of the IET\ndistributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2014 16:48:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 15:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

The\ndiscussion focuses on developments beyond the by now well established\ncombination of density functional and dynamical mean field theory dubbed\n\"LDA+DMFT\". It is organized around the description of dynamical screening\neffects in the solid. Indeed, screening in the solid gives rise to dynamical\nlocal Coulomb interactions U(w) (Aryasetiawan et al 2004 Phys. Rev. B 70\n195104), and this frequency-dependence leads to effects that cannot be\nneglected in a truly first principles description.

B 85 035115 (2012), Werner et al.\nNature Phys. 8 331 (2012)). A reliable description of dynamical screening\neffects is also a central ingredient of the \"GW+DMFT\" scheme (Biermann et al.\nPhys.

The resulting\noptimization problem is nonconvex (in the objective function and constraints).\nNevertheless, in the single-user case, we are able to express the global\noptimal solution in closed form.

Whether for fear of judgment or personal endangerment, it is crucial\nto keep anonymous the identity of the user who initially posted a sensitive\nmessage. In this paper, we consider an adversary who observes a snapshot of the\nspread of a message at a certain time. Recent advances in rumor source\ndetection shows that the existing messaging protocols are vulnerable against\nsuch an adversary. We introduce a novel messaging protocol, which we call\nadaptive diffusion, and show that it spreads the messages fast and achieves a\nperfect obfuscation of the source when the underlying contact network is an\ninfinite regular tree: all users with the message are nearly equally likely to\nhave been the origin of the message. Experiments on a sampled Facebook network\nshow that it effectively hides the location of the source even when the graph\nis finite, irregular and has cycles.

First,\nfor a number of the known radial velocity (RV) giants we computed traditional\nforward models of their atmospheric structure and clouds, given various input\nassumptions, and computed model albedo spectra. Such models have been computed\nbefore, but mostly for generic planets. Our new models demonstrate that there\nis likely interesting spectral diversity among those planets that are most\nfavorable for direct detection. Second, we applied a powerful Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) retrieval technique to synthetic noisy data of cool giants\nto better understand how well various atmospheric parameters--particularly\nmolecular abundances and cloud properties--could be constrained. This is the\nfirst time such techniques have been applied to this problem. The process is\ntime consuming, so only a dozen or so cases could be completed in the limited\ntime available. Nevertheless the results clearly show that even at S/N ~ 5,\nscientifically interesting and valuable conclusions can be drawn about the\nproperties of giant planet atmospheres from noisy spectra. We find that\natmospheric abundances are best constrained when the planet gravity is bounded.\nThus direct imaging observations of known radial velocity planets are extremely\nvaluable as limits on a target planet's gravity can be obtained from\nastrometric imaging and reflectivity and mass-radius relationship arguments\n(for mass and radius, respectively). Further retrieval studies are clearly\nwarranted and would be valuable to help guide instrument design decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2014 19:51:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

Continuum models\nfall into two classes: sharp-interface models, where interfaces are singular\nsurfaces; and regularized-interface models, such as phase-field models, where\ninterfaces are smeared out. The former are challenging for numerical solutions\nbecause the interfaces need to be explicitly tracked, but have the advantage\nthat the kinetics of existing interfaces and the nucleation of new interfaces\ncan be transparently and precisely prescribed. In contrast, phase-field models\ndo not require explicit tracking of interfaces, thereby enabling relatively\nsimple numerical calculations, but the specification of kinetics and nucleation\nis both restrictive and extremely opaque. This prevents straightforward\ncalibration of phase-field models to experiment and/or molecular simulations,\nand breaks the multiscale hierarchy of passing information from atomic to\ncontinuum.\n  We present the formulation of a phase-field model -- i.e., a model with\nregularized interfaces that do not require explicit numerical tracking -- that\nallows for easy and transparent prescription of complex interface kinetics and\nnucleation. The key ingredients are a re-parametrization of the energy density\nto clearly separate nucleation from kinetics; and an evolution law that comes\nfrom a conservation statement for interfaces. This enables clear prescription\nof nucleation through the source term of the conservation law and of kinetics\nthrough an interfacial velocity field. A formal limit of the kinetic driving\nforce recovers the classical continuum sharp-interface driving force, providing\nconfidence in both the re-parametrized energy and the evolution statement.\n  We present a number of numerical calculations in one and two dimensions to\ncharacterize and demonstrate the formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2014 21:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-31"}

The conventional treatment is to take a typical momentum\nas the renormalization scale, which assigns an arbitrary range and an arbitrary\nsystematic error to pQCD predictions, leading to the well-known renormalization\nscheme and scale ambiguities. As a practical solution for such scale setting\nproblem, the \"Principle of Minimum Sensitivity\" (PMS), has been proposed in the\nliterature. The PMS suggests to determine an optimal scale for the pQCD\napproximant of an observable by requiring its slope over the scheme and scale\nchanges to vanish. In the paper, we present a detailed discussion on general\nproperties of PMS by utilizing three quantities $R_{e^+e^-}$, $R_\\tau$ and\n$\\Gamma(H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b})$ up to four-loop QCD corrections. After applying\nthe PMS, the accuracy of pQCD prediction, the pQCD convergence, the pQCD\npredictive power and etc., have been discussed. Furthermore, we compare PMS\nwith another fundamental scale setting approach, i.e. the Principle of Maximum\nConformality (PMC)... Our results show that PMS does provide a practical way to\nset the effective scale for high-energy process, and the PMS prediction agrees\nwith the PMC one by including enough high-order QCD corrections, both of which\nshall be more accurate than the prediction under the conventional scale\nsetting. However, the PMS pQCD convergence is an accidental, which usually\nfails to achieve a correct prediction of unknown high-order contributions with\nnext-to-leading order QCD correction only, i.e. it is always far from the\n\"true\" values predicted by including more high-order contributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 00:30:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 01:37:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 13:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

A first\nstep involves dualising a criterion for the reality of the wavefunction\nproposed by Harrigan & Spekkens, which was central to the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph\ntheorem. The resulting criterion has several advantages, including the\navoidance of certain technical difficulties relating to sets of measure zero.\nBy considering the 'reality' not of the wavefunction but of the observable\nproperties of any ontological physical theory a new characterisation of\nnon-locality and contextuality is found. Secondly, a careful analysis of\npreparation independence, one of the key assumptions of the PBR theorem, leads\nto a precise analogy with the kind of locality prohibited by Bell's theorem.\nMotivated by this, we propose a weakening of the assumption to something\nanalogous to no-signalling. This amounts to allowing global or non-local\ncorrelations in the joint ontic state, which nevertheless do not allow for\nsuperluminal signalling. This is, at least, consistent with the Bell and\nKochen-Specker theorems.

Here we conjecture that to all loop orders these\nconstraints give us the key analytic information contained in dual conformal\nsymmetry. We also conjecture that to all loop orders, while N = 8 supergravity\nhas poles at infinity, at least at four points it has only logarithmic\nsingularities at finite locations. We provide nontrivial evidence for these\nconjectures. For the three-loop four-point N = 4 super-Yang-Mills amplitude, we\nexplicitly construct a complete basis of diagram integrands that has only\nlogarithmic singularities and no poles at infinity. We then express the\ncomplete amplitude in terms of the basis diagrams, with the coefficients\ndetermined by unitarity. We also give examples at three loops showing how to\nmake the logarithmic singularity properties manifest via dlog forms. We give\nadditional evidence at four and five loops supporting the nonplanar logarithmic\nsingularity conjecture. Furthermore, we present a variety of examples\nillustrating that these constraints are more restrictive than dual conformal\nsymmetry. Our investigations show that the singularity structures of planar and\nnonplanar amplitudes in N = 4 super-Yang-Mills are strikingly similar. While it\nis not clear how to extend either dual conformal symmetry or a dual formulation\nto the nonplanar sector, these results suggest that related concepts might\nexist and await discovery.

In this model, the edges of a graph are revealed one by one\nand the algorithm is required to always maintain a valid matching. On seeing an\nedge, the algorithm has to either accept or reject the edge. If accepted, then\nthe adjacent edges are discarded. The complexity of the problem is settled for\ndeterministic algorithms.\n  Almost nothing is known for randomized algorithms. A lower bound of $1.693$\nis known for MCM with a trivial upper bound of $2$. An upper bound of $5.356$\nis known for MWM.

Also the proportion factor of\ndistance is proposed to weight the RGB values. By comparing the nearness\ndegrees of the RGB sequences between the samples and the mobile node, samples\ncan be filtered out.

This feature\narises by fluorescence when the accretion disc is illuminated by hot corona\nabove it. Due to central location of the corona the illumination and thus also\nthe line emission decrease with radius. It was reported in the literature that\nthis decrease is very steep in some of the sources, suggesting a highly compact\ncorona.\n  We revisit the lamp-post setup in which the corona is positioned on the axis\nabove the rotating black hole and investigate to what extent the steep\nemissivity can be explained by this scenario. We show the contributions of the\nrelativistic effects to the disc illumination by the primary source - energy\nshift, light bending and aberration. The lamp-post radial illumination pattern\nis compared to the widely used radial broken power-law emissivity profile. We\nfind that very steep emissivities require the primary illuminating source to be\npositioned very near the black hole horizon and/or the spectral power-law index\nof the primary emission to be very high. The broken power-law approximation of\nthe illumination can be safely used when the primary source is located at\nlarger heights. However, for low heights the lamp-post illumination\nconsiderably differs from this approximation.\n  We also show the variations of the iron line local flux over the disc due to\nthe flux dependence on incident and emission angles. The former depends mainly\non the height of the primary source while the latter depends on the inclination\nangle of the observer. Thus the strength of the line varies substantially\nacross the disc. This effect may contribute to the observed steeper emissivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 13:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-31"}

A key point is to endow Banach spaces with reproducing kernels\nsuch that machine learning in RKBSs can be well-posed and of easy\nimplementation. First we verify many advanced properties of the general RKBSs\nsuch as density, continuity, separability, implicit representation, imbedding,\ncompactness, representer theorem for learning methods, oracle inequality, and\nuniversal approximation. Then, we develop a new concept of generalized Mercer\nkernels to construct $p$-norm RKBSs for $1\\leq p\\leq\\infty$. The $p$-norm RKBSs\npreserve the same simple format as the Mercer representation of RKHSs.\nMoreover, the $p$-norm RKBSs are isometrically equivalent to the standard\n$p$-norm spaces of countable sequences. Hence, the $p$-norm RKBSs possess more\ngeometrical structures than RKHSs including sparsity. The generalized Mercer\nkernels also cover many well-known kernels, for example, min kernels, Gaussian\nkernels, and power series kernels. Finally, we propose to solve the support\nvector machines in the $p$-norm RKBSs, which are to minimize the regularized\nempirical risks over the $p$-norm RKBSs. We show that the infinite dimensional\nsupport vector machines in the $p$-norm RKBSs can be equivalently transferred\nto finite dimensional convex optimization problems such that we obtain the\nfinite dimensional representations of the support vector machine solutions for\npractical applications. In particular, we verify that some special support\nvector machines in the $1$-norm RKBSs are equivalent to the classical $1$-norm\nsparse regressions. This gives fundamental supports of a novel learning tool\ncalled sparse learning methods to be investigated in our next research project.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 15:41:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 16:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-27"}

OFDM\nsignals exhibit Gaussian characteristics in time domain and fourth order\ncumulants of Gaussian distributed signals vanish in contrary to the cumulants\nof other signals. Thus fourth order cumulants can be utilized for OFDM signal\nidentification. In this paper, first, formulations of the estimates of the\nfourth order cumulants for OFDM signals are provided. Then it is shown these\nestimates are affected significantly from the wireless channel impairments,\nfrequency offset, phase offset and sampling mismatch. To overcome these\nproblems, a general chi-square constant false alarm rate Gaussianity test which\nemploys estimates of cumulants and their covariances is adapted to the specific\ncase of wireless OFDM signals. Estimation of the covariance matrix of the\nfourth order cumulants are greatly simplified peculiar to the OFDM signals. A\nmeasurement setup is developed to analyze the performance of the identification\nmethod and for comparison purposes. A parametric measurement analysis is\nprovided depending on modulation order, signal to noise ratio, number of\nsymbols, and degree of freedom of the underlying test. The proposed method\noutperforms statistical tests which are based on fixed thresholds or empirical\nvalues, while a priori information requirement and complexity of the proposed\nmethod are lower than the coherent identification techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Dec 2014 22:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-05"}
