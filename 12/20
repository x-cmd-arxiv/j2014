However, as adoption of smFRET techniques becomes more\nwidespread, the lack of available software, whether open source or commercial,\nfor data analysis, is becoming a significant issue. Here, we present pyFRET, an\nopen source Python package for the analysis of data from single-molecule\nfluorescence experiments from freely diffusing biomolecules. The package\nprovides methods for the complete analysis of a smFRET dataset, from burst\nselection and denoising, through data visualisation and model fitting. We\nprovide support for both continuous excitation and alternating laser excitation\n(ALEX) data analysis. pyFRET is available as a package downloadable from the\nPython Package Index (PyPI) under the open source three-clause BSD licence,\ntogether with links to extensive documentation and tutorials, including example\nusage and test data. Additional documentation including tutorials is hosted\nindependently on ReadTheDocs. The code is available from the free hosting site\nBitbucket. Through distribution of this software, we hope to lower the barrier\nfor the adoption of smFRET experiments by other research groups and we\nencourage others to contribute modules for specific analysis needs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 16:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-22"}

We discuss the origin of this new class of pulsars\nwithin the standard picture of LMXBs formation and apply our results to the\ncase of IGR J17480-2446. The magnetothermal evolution of the binary system is\nstudied numerically by taking into account the effect of different accretion\nrates during the Roche-lobe overflow in the framework of the minimal cooling\nscenario. We show that, in addition to standard millisecond pulsars,\nlong-period low magnetic field pulsars should also be expected as a possible\noutcome of the binary evolution, depending on the strength of the accretion\nrate during the Roche-lobe overflow. In particular, we argue that IGR\nJ17480-2446 belongs to this new class of objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 16:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Surprisingly, however, the construction of\nheterotic--string derived models that allow for an extra Z' to remain unbroken\ndown to low scales has proven to be very difficult. The main reason being that\nthe U(1) symmetries that are typically discussed in the literature are either\nanomalous or have to be broken at a high scale to generate light neutrino\nmasses. In this paper we use for that purpose the self duality property under\nthe spinor vector duality, which was discovered in free fermionic\nheterotic-string models. The chiral massless states in the self--dual models\nfill complete 27 representations of E6. The anomaly free gauge symmetry in the\neffective low energy field theory of our string model is $SU(4)_C\\times\nSU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_\\zeta$, where $U(1)_\\zeta$ is the family\nuniversal $U(1)$ symmetry that descends from E6, and is typically anomalous in\nother free fermionic heterotic-string models. Our model therefore allows for\nthe existence of a low scale Z', which is a combination of $B-L$, $T_{3_L}$ and\n$T_{3_R}$. The string model is free of exotic fractionally charged states in\nthe massless spectrum. It contains exotic SO(10) singlet states that carry\nfractional, non--E6 charge, with respect to $U(1)_\\zeta$. These non-E6 states\narise in the string model due to the breaking of the E6 symmetry by discrete\nWilson lines. They represent a distinct signature of the string vacua and\ncannot arise in E6 Grand Unified Theories. They may provide viable dark matter\ncandidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 16:46:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2015 13:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

We further show that\nthese effects hold when translating from both English to French and English to\nGerman, and argue that the desirable properties of translation embeddings\nshould emerge largely independently of the source and target languages.\nFinally, we apply a new method for training neural translation models with very\nlarge vocabularies, and show that this vocabulary expansion algorithm results\nin minimal degradation of embedding quality. Our embedding spaces can be\nqueried in an online demo and downloaded from our web page. Overall, our\nanalyses indicate that translation-based embeddings should be used in\napplications that require concepts to be organised according to similarity\nand/or lexical function, while monolingual embeddings are better suited to\nmodelling (nonspecific) inter-word relatedness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 17:22:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 16:55:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 18:30:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2015 18:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-06"}

The related studies also suggested an\ninteresting form of decoupling of the heavy Kaluza-Klein (KK) fermion states in\nthe warped 5D SM in the limit where the profile of the SM Higgs approaches the\nIR brane. We demonstrate that a similar phenomenon occurs when we include the\nmandatory KK excitations of the SM Higgs in loop diagrams giving dipole\noperators for SM fermions, where the earlier work only considered the SM Higgs\n(zero mode). In particular, in the limit of a quasi IR-localized SM Higgs, the\neffect from summing over KK Higgs modes is unsuppressed (yet finite), in\ncontrast to the naive expectation that KK Higgs modes decouple as their masses\nbecome large. In this case, a wide range of KK Higgs modes have\nquasi-degenerate masses and enhanced couplings to fermions relative to those of\nthe SM Higgs, which contribute to the above remarkable result. In addition, we\nfind that the total contribution from KK Higgs modes in general can be\ncomparable to that from the SM Higgs alone. It is also interesting that KK\nHiggs couplings to KK fermions of the same chirality as the corresponding SM\nmodes have an unsuppressed overall contribution, in contrast to the result from\nthe earlier studies involving the SM Higgs. Our studies suggest that KK Higgs\nbosons are generally an indispensable part of the warped 5D SM, and their\nphenomenology such as signals at the LHC are worth further investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 18:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-22"}

The\nformulation applies to non-ideal mixtures of arbitrary number of species,\nwithout the need to single out a 'solvent' species, and includes contributions\nto the diffusive mass flux due to gradients of composition, temperature and\npressure. Momentum transport and advective mass transport are handled using a\nlow Mach number approach that eliminates fast sound waves (pressure\nfluctuations) from the full compressible system of equations and leads to a\nquasi-incompressible formulation.

Long-range and static CuO6 tilt order with\northogonally inequivalent Cu-O bonds in the CuO2 planes in the low temperature\ntetragonal (LTT) phase is succeeded on warming through the low-temperature\ntransition by one with orthogonally equivalent bonds in the low temperature\northorhombic (LTO) phase. In contrast, the signatures of LTT-type tilts in the\ninstantaneous local atomic structure persist on heating throughout the LTO\ncrystallographic phase on the nanoscale, although becoming weaker as\ntemperature increases. Analysis of the INS spectra for the x = 1/8 composition\nreveals the dynamic nature of the LTT-like tilt fluctuations within the LTO\nphase and their 3D character. The doping dependence of relevant structural\nparameters indicates that the magnitude of the Cu-O bond anisotropy has a\nmaximum at x = 1/8 doping where bulk superconductivity is most strongly\nsuppressed, suggesting that the structural anisotropy might be influenced by\nelectron-phonon coupling and the particular stability of the stripe-ordered\nphase at this composition. The bond-length modulation that pins stripe order is\nfound to be remarkably subtle, with no anomalous bond length disorder at low\ntemperature, placing an upper limit on any in-plane Cu-O bondlength anisotropy.\nThe results further reveal that although appreciable octahedral tilts persist\nthrough the high-temperature transition and into the high temperature\ntetragonal (HTT) phase, there is no significant preference between different\ntilt directions in the HTT regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 20:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-03"}

Noise-contrastive estimation\n(NCE) is an estimation procedure in which a generative model is trained to be\nable to distinguish data samples from noise samples. Generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs) are pairs of generator and discriminator networks, with the\ngenerator network learning to generate samples by attempting to fool the\ndiscriminator network into believing its samples are real data. Both estimation\nprocedures use the same function to drive learning, which naturally raises\nquestions about how they are related to each other, as well as whether this\nfunction is related to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). NCE corresponds to\ntraining an internal data model belonging to the {\\em discriminator} network\nbut using a fixed generator network. We show that a variant of NCE, with a\ndynamic generator network, is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation.\nSince pairing a learned discriminator with an appropriate dynamically selected\ngenerator recovers MLE, one might expect the reverse to hold for pairing a\nlearned generator with a certain discriminator. However, we show that\nrecovering MLE for a learned generator requires departing from the\ndistinguishability game.

How long the accretion persists depends on whether the\nprotostellar outflows are present. We set the mass outflow rate to 1% of the\nstellar sink particle's accretion rate.

The anisotropic thermal conduction is\nmainly proceeding parallel to magnetic fields and suppressed perpendicular to\nthe fields. We derive the SPH formalism for the anisotropic heat transport and\nsolve the corresponding equation with an implicit conjugate gradient scheme. We\ndiscuss several issues of unphysical heat transport in the cases of extreme\nansiotropies or unmagnetized regions and present possible numerical\nworkarounds. We implement our algorithm into the GADGET code and study its\nbehaviour in several test cases. In general, we reproduce the analytical\nsolutions of our idealised test problems, and obtain good results in\ncosmological simulations of galaxy cluster formations. Within galaxy clusters,\nthe anisotropic conduction produces a net heat transport similar to an\nisotropic Spitzer conduction model with an efficiency of one per cent. In\ncontrast to isotropic conduction our new formalism allows small-scale structure\nin the temperature distribution to remain stable, because of their decoupling\ncaused by magnetic field lines. Compared to observations, isotropic conduction\nwith more than 10 per cent of the Spitzer value leads to an oversmoothed\ntemperature distribution within clusters, while the results obtained with\nanisotropic thermal conduction reproduce the observed temperature fluctuations\nwell. A proper treatment of heat transport is crucial especially in the\noutskirts of clusters and also in high density regions.

In particular, the complete\nobser- vations in data with censoring, truncation or missing covariates can be\nregarded as response-biased sampling under certain conditions. This paper\nproposes to use transformation models, known as the generalized accelerated\nfailure time model in econometrics, for regression analysis with\nresponse-biased sampling. With unknown error distribution, the transformation\nmodels are broad enough to cover linear re- gression models, the Cox's model\nand the proportional odds model as special cases. To the best of our knowledge,\nexcept for the case-control logistic regression, there is no report in the\nliterature that a prospective estimation approach can work for biased sampling\nwithout any modification. We prove that the maximum rank corre- lation\nestimation is valid for response-biased sampling and establish its consistency\nand asymptotic normality. Unlike the inverse probability methods, the proposed\nmethod of estimation does not involve the sampling probabilities, which are\noften difficult to obtain in practice. Without the need of estimating the\nunknown trans- formation function or the error distribution, the proposed\nmethod is numerically easy to implement with the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm,\nwhich does not require convexity or continuity.
