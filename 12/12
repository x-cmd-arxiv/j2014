It might not be possible to disclose the process.\nIn addition, even if the process is open, it might be hard to elucidate in a\nlegal setting how the algorithm makes its decisions. Instead of requiring\naccess to the algorithm, we propose making inferences based on the data the\nalgorithm uses.\n  We make four contributions to this problem. First, we link the legal notion\nof disparate impact to a measure of classification accuracy that while known,\nhas received relatively little attention. Second, we propose a test for\ndisparate impact based on analyzing the information leakage of the protected\nclass from the other data attributes. Third, we describe methods by which data\nmight be made unbiased. Finally, we present empirical evidence supporting the\neffectiveness of our test for disparate impact and our approach for both\nmasking bias and preserving relevant information in the data. Interestingly,\nour approach resembles some actual selection practices that have recently\nreceived legal scrutiny.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 18:42:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 03:48:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 00:54:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-17"}

We\nfind ranges of the parameters, depending mildly on the renormalization scale,\nwith adjustable values of the spectral index ns, tensor-to-scalar ratio\nr=(2-4)x10^-3, and an inflaton mass close to 3x10^13 GeV.

Even under the simplifying assumptions of no\nconfounding, no feedback loops, and no selection bias, such bivariate causal\ndiscovery problems are challenging.

This increased\ngrowth allows the black hole to efficiently evacuate gas from the central\nregion of the galaxy, driving strong winds up to ~2500 km/s, producing outflows\n~10x stronger than the smooth accretion case, suppressing the inflow of gas\nonto the host galaxy, and suppressing the star formation within the galaxy by\nas much as a factor of two.

Here we provide the\nfirst derivation of a general unattainability principle, which applies to\narbitrary cooling processes, even those exploiting the laws of quantum\nmechanics or involving an infinite-dimensional reservoir. We quantify the\nresources needed to cool a system to any particular temperature, and translate\nthese resources into a minimal time or number of steps by considering the\nnotion of a Thermal Machine which obeys similar restrictions to universal\ncomputers. We generally find that the obtainable temperature can scale as an\ninverse power of the cooling time. Our argument relies on the heat capacity of\nthe bath being positive, and we show that if this is not the case then perfect\ncooling in finite time is in principle possible.

The He II 1640 line strength can\nconstrain the mass and IMF of Pop III stars. We use F132N narrowband filter on\nthe Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) to look for\nstrong He II lambda 1640 emission in the galaxy BDF-521 at z=7.01, one of the\nmost distant spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies to date. Using deep F132N\nnarrowband imaging, together with our broadband imaging with F125W and F160W\nfilters, we do not detect He II emission from this galaxy, but place a 2-sigma\nupper limit on the flux of 5.3x10^-19 ergs s^-1 cm^-2. This measurement\ncorresponds to a 2-sigma upper limit on the Pop III star formation rate\n(SFR_PopIII) of ~ 0.2 M_solar yr^-1, assuming a Salpeter IMF with 50< M/M_solar\n< 1000. From the high signal-to-noise broadband measurements in F125W and\nF160W, we fit the UV continuum for BDF-521. The spectral flux density is ~ 3.6x\n10^-11 lambda^-2.32 ergs s^-1 cm^-2 A^-1, which corresponds to an overall\nunobscured SFR of ~ 5 M_solar yr^-1. Our upper limit on SFR_PopIII suggests\nthat massive Pop III stars represent < 4% of the total star formation. Further,\nthe HST high resolution imaging suggests that BDF-521 is an extremely compact\ngalaxy, with a half-light radius of 0.6 kpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 22:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Our large sample contains galaxies in a wide range of\nenvironments, with stellar masses 8 < log(M*/Msun) < 12, spanning the entire\nmorphological spectrum from pure disks to spheroids. We derive estimates for\nthe black hole masses from measured central velocity dispersions and bulge\nmasses, using a variety of published empirical relationships. We find a very\nstrong dependence of the passive fraction on black hole mass, which is largely\nunaffected by the details of the black hole mass estimate. Moreover, the\npassive fraction relationship with black hole mass remains strong and tight\neven at fixed values of galaxy stellar mass (M*), dark matter halo mass\n(Mhalo), and bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio (B/T). Whereas, the passive\nfraction dependence on M*, Mhalo and B/T is weak at fixed MBH. These\nobservations show that, for central galaxies, MBH is the strongest correlator\nwith the passive fraction, consistent with quenching from AGN feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 00:24:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-15"}

In this paper I\ndiscuss another, less obvious situation, in which large relativistic effects\nmay arise due to a complicated, multiscale structure of the matter\ndistribution. I present an exact solution with an inhomogeneous energy density\ndistribution in the form of a hierarchy of nested voids and overdensities of\nvarious sizes, extending from the homogeneity scale down to arbitrary small\nscales. I show that although each of the voids and overdensities seems to be\nvery weakly relativistic, and thus easy to describe using the linearized\ngeneral relativity, the solution taken as a whole lies in fact in the nonlinear\nregime. Its nonlinear properties are most easily seen when we compare the ADM\nmass of the solution and the integral of the local mass density: the difference\nbetween them, i.e. the relativistic mass deficit, can be significant provided\nthat the inhomogeneities extend to sufficiently small scales. The\nnon-additivity of masses implies a large backreaction effect, i.e. significant\ndiscrepancy between the averaged, large-scale effective stress-energy tensor\nand the naive average of the local energy density.

In this paper, we propose a simple model of\ndust enrichment in a galaxy with a simplified treatment of grain size\ndistribution by imposing a `two-size approximation'; that is, all the grain\npopulation is represented by small (grain radius a < 0.03 micron) and large (a\n> 0.03 micron) grains. We include in the model dust supply from stellar ejecta,\ndestruction in supernova shocks, dust growth by accretion, grain growth by\ncoagulation and grain disruption by shattering, considering how these processes\nwork on the small and large grains. We show that this simple framework\nreproduces the main features found in full calculations of grain size\ndistributions as follows. The dust enrichment starts with the supply of large\ngrains from stars. At a metallicity level referred to as the critical\nmetallicity of accretion, the abundance of the small grains formed by\nshattering becomes large enough to rapidly increase the grain abundance by\naccretion. Associated with this epoch, the mass ratio of the small grains to\nthe large grains reaches the maximum. After that, this ratio converges to the\nvalue determined by the balance between shattering and coagulation, and the\ndust-to-metal ratio is determined by the balance between accretion and shock\ndestruction. With a Monte Carlo simulation, we demonstrate that the simplicity\nof our model has an advantage in predicting statistical properties. We also\nshow some applications for predicting observational dust properties such as\nextinction curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 01:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

While techniques have been proposed for selecting input nodes\nbased on either performance metrics or controllability, a unifying approach\nbased on joint consideration of performance and controllability is an open\nproblem. In this paper, we develop a submodular optimization framework for\nselecting input nodes based on joint performance and controllability in\nstructured linear descriptor systems. We develop our framework for arbitrary\nlinear descriptor systems. In developing our framework, we first prove that\nselecting a minimum-size set of input nodes for controllability is a matroid\nintersection problem that can be solved in polynomial-time in the network size.\nWe then prove that input selection to maximize a performance metric with\ncontrollability as a constraint is equivalent to maximizing a monotone\nsubmodular function with two matroid basis constraints, and derive efficient\napproximation algorithms with provable optimality bounds for input selection.\nFinally, we present a graph controllability index metric, which characterizes\nthe largest controllable subgraph of a given complex network, and prove its\nsubmodular structure, leading to input selection algorithms that trade-off\nperformance and controllability.

The main contribution of\nour work is a novel combinatorial technique that enables us to use any\nSelect-Project-Join query plan for a given CQ without inequalities in answering\nthe CQ with inequalities, with an additional factor in running time that only\ndepends on the query. The key idea is to define a new projection operator,\nwhich keeps a small representation (independent of the size of the database) of\nthe set of input tuples that map to each tuple in the output of the projection;\nthis representation is used to evaluate all the inequalities in the query.\nSecond, we generalize a result by Papadimitriou-Yannakakis [17] and give an\nalternative algorithm based on the color-coding technique [4] to evaluate a CQ\nwith inequalities by using an algorithm for the CQ without inequalities. Third,\nwe investigate the structure of the query graph, inequality graph, and the\naugmented query graph with inequalities, and show that even if the query and\nthe inequality graphs have bounded treewidth, the augmented graph not only can\nhave an unbounded treewidth but can also be NP-hard to evaluate. Further, we\nillustrate classes of queries and inequalities where the augmented graphs have\nunbounded treewidth, but the CQ with inequalities can be evaluated in\npoly-time. Finally, we give necessary properties and sufficient properties that\nallow a class of CQs to have poly-time combined complexity with respect to any\ninequality pattern.

One can simply model\na temporal network as either a single aggregate static network, or as a series\nof time-specific snapshots, each of which is an aggregate static network over\nthe corresponding time window. The advantage of modeling the temporal data in\nthese two ways is that one can use existing well established methods for static\nnetwork analysis to study the resulting aggregate network(s). Here, we develop\na novel approach for studying temporal network data more explicitly. We base\nour methodology on the well established notion of graphlets (subgraphs), which\nhave been successfully used in numerous contexts in static network research.\nHere, we take the notion of static graphlets to the next level and develop new\ntheory needed to allow for graphlet-based analysis of temporal networks. Our\nnew notion of dynamic graphlets is quite different than existing approaches for\ndynamic network analysis that are based on temporal motifs (statistically\nsignificant subgraphs). Namely, these approaches suffer from many limitations.\nFor example, they can only deal with subgraph structures of limited complexity.\nAlso, their major drawback is that their results heavily depend on the choice\nof a null network model that is required to evaluate the significance of a\nsubgraph. However, choosing an appropriate null network model is a non-trivial\ntask. Our dynamic graphlet approach overcomes the limitations of the existing\ntemporal motif-based approaches. At the same time, when we thoroughly evaluate\nthe ability of our new approach to characterize the structure and function of\nan entire temporal network or of individual nodes, we find that the dynamic\ngraphlet approach outperforms the static graphlet approach, which indicates\nthat accounting for temporal information helps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 04:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-15"}

After the MeV/GeV detection from 3C 120 in MJD 56240-56300, 43 GHz VLBA\nmonitoring revealed a brightening of the radio core, followed by the ejection\nof a superluminal knot. Since we observed the gamma-ray and VLBA phenomena in\ntemporal proximity to each other, it is naturally assumed that they are\nphysically connected. This assumption was further supported by the subsequent\nobservation that the 43 GHz core brightened again after a gamma-ray flare\noccurred around MJD 56560. We can then infer that the MeV/GeV emission took\nplace inside an unresolved 43 GHz core of 3C 120 and that the jet dissipation\noccurred at sub-parsec distances from the central black hole, if we take the\ndistance of the 43 GHz core from the central black hole as ~ 0.5 pc, as\npreviously estimated from the time lag between X-ray dips and knot ejections\n(Marscher et al. 2002; Chatterjee et al. 2009).

The energy transfers\nare evaluated from two-point third-order three-component velocity structure\nfunctions, which we measure using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry in\nthe rotating frame. Without global rotation, the energy is transferred from\nlarge to small scales, as in classical three-dimensional turbulence. For\nnonzero rotation rates, the horizontal kinetic energy presents a double\ncascade: a direct cascade at small horizontal scales and an inverse cascade at\nlarge horizontal scales. By contrast, the vertical kinetic energy is always\ntransferred from large to small horizontal scales, a behavior reminiscent of\nthe dynamics of a passive scalar in two-dimensional turbulence. At the largest\nrotation rate the flow is nearly two-dimensional, and a pure inverse energy\ncascade is found for the horizontal energy.

Although a\nrelationship between solar activity and the brightness of the Sun had long been\nsuspected, it was only directly observed after regular satellite measurements\nbecame available with the launch of Nimbus-7 in 1978. The measurement of solar\nirradiance from space is accompanied by the development of models aimed at\ndescribing the apparent variability by the intensity excess/deficit effected by\nmagnetic structures in the photosphere. The more sophisticated models, termed\nsemi-empirical, rely on the intensity spectra of photospheric magnetic\nstructures generated with radiative transfer codes from semi-empirical model\natmospheres. An established example of such models is SATIRE-S (Spectral And\nTotal Irradiance REconstruction for the Satellite era). One key limitation of\ncurrent semi-empirical models is the fact that the radiant properties of\nnetwork and faculae are not adequately represented due to the use of\nplane-parallel model atmospheres (as opposed to three-dimensional model\natmospheres). This thesis is the compilation of four publications, detailing\nthe results of investigations aimed at setting the groundwork necessary for the\neventual introduction of three-dimensional atmospheres into SATIRE-S and a\nreview of the current state of the measurement and modelling of solar\nirradiance.

A critical issue is to rigorously bound the error of\nsuch approximations, not with respect to a fixed finite dimensional discrete\nbackground problem, but with respect to the exact solution of the continuous\nproblem. While the energy norm offers a natural error measure corresponding to\nthe underlying operator considered as an isomorphism from the energy space onto\nits dual, this norm requires a careful treatment in its interplay with the\ntensor structure of the problem. In this paper we build on our previous work on\nenergy norm-convergent subspace-based tensor schemes contriving, however, a\nmodified formulation which now enforces convergence only in $L_2$. In order to\nstill be able to exploit the mapping properties of elliptic operators, a\ncrucial ingredient of our approach is the development and analysis of a\nsuitable asymmetric preconditioning scheme. We provide estimates for the\ncomputational complexity of the resulting method in terms of the solution error\nand study the practical performance of the scheme in numerical experiments. In\nboth regards, we find that controlling solution errors in this weaker norm\nleads to substantial simplifications and to a reduction of the actual numerical\nwork required for a certain error tolerance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 11:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-15"}

Reasonable values of lattice\nparameters and chalcogen atomic positions in the tetragonal unit cell of iron\nchalcogenides have been obtained with the use of norm-conserving\npseudopotentials. The well known discrepancies between experimental data and\nDFT-calculated results for structural parameters of iron chalcogenides are\nrelated to the semicore atomic states which were frozen in the used here\napproach. Such an approach yields valid results of the electronic structures of\nthe investigated compounds. The Ru-based chalcogenides exhibit the same\ntopology of the Fermi surface (FS) as that of FeSe, differing only in subtle FS\nnesting features.

We consider how brief\ntransient signals (on the order of seconds or minutes) originating from this\nlocation would appear in our data. We also consider how automatic radio\nfrequency interference (RFI) flagging at radio telescope observatories might\naffect these and other transient observations in the future, particularly with\nbrief transients of a few seconds duration.\n  Methods: We observed the field in the low-frequency regime at 149 MHz with\ndata obtained over several months with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). We also\npresent simulations where a brief transient is injected into the data in order\nto see how it would appear in our measurement sets, and how it would be\naffected by RFI flagging. Finally, both based on simulation work and the\nweighted average of the observed background over the course of the individual\nobservations, we present the possibility of brief radio transients in the data.\n  Results: Our observations of Swift J1644+57 yielded no detection of the\nsource and a peak flux density at this position of 24.7 $\\pm$ 8.9 mJy. Our\nupper limit on the transient rate of the snapshot surface density in this field\nat sensitivities < 0.5 Jy is $\\rho < 2.2 \\times10^{-2}$ deg$^{-2}$. We also\nconclude that we did not observe any brief transient signals originating\nspecifically from the Swift J1644+57 source itself, and searches for such\ntransients are severely limited by automatic RFI flagging algorithms which flag\ntransients of less than 2 minutes duration. As such, careful consideration of\nRFI flagging techniques must occur when searching for transient signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 13:28:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-15"}

Contribution of the exchange part of the\nelectric dipole interaction is found. Hence we obtain a model of dipolar\nfermions beyond the self-consistent field approximation. It is shown that the\nexchange interaction of electric dipolar fermions depends on the\nspin-polarisation of the system. For instance the electric dipole exchange\ninteraction equals to zero for spin-unpolarised systems, namely all low laying\nquantum states occupied by two-particles with opposite spins. In opposite limit\nof the full spin polarisation of the degenerate fermions, then we have one\nparticle in each quantum states, the exchange interaction has maximum value,\nwhich is comparable with the self-consistent field part of the dipole-dipole\ninteraction.

In\nfact, it has recently been theoretically predicted that superimposing quantum\ncircuits, each with a different gate order, could provide quantum computers\nwith an even further computational advantage [3-5]. Here, we experimentally\ndemonstrate this enhancement by applying two quantum gates in a superposition\nof both possible orders to determine whether the two gates commute or\nanti-commute. We are able to make this determination with only a single use (or\nquery) of each gate, while all quantum circuits with a fixed order of gates\nwould require at least two uses of one of the gates [3]. Remarkably, when the\nproblem is scaled to N gates, creating a superposition of quantum circuits is\nlikely to provide an exponential advantage over classical algorithms, and a\nlinear advantage over quantum algorithms with fixed gate order [4]. The new\nresource that we exploit in our experiment can be interpreted as a\n\"superposition of causal orders\". We demonstrate such a superposition could\nallow some quantum algorithms to be implemented with an efficiency that is\nunlikely to be achieved on a quantum computer with a fixed gate order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 14:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-23"}

Nevertheless, the quantum physicist\nHenry Stapp promoted the view that the mind could utilize quantum Zeno effect\nto influence brain dynamics and that the efficacy of such mental efforts would\nnot be undermined by environmental decoherence of the brain. To address the\nphysical plausibility of Stapp's claim, we modeled the brain using quantum\ntunneling of an electron in a multiple-well structure such as the voltage\nsensor in neuronal ion channels and performed Monte Carlo simulations of\nquantum Zeno effect exerted by the mind upon the brain in the presence or\nabsence of environmental decoherence. The simulations unambiguously showed that\nthe quantum Zeno effect breaks down for timescales greater than the brain\ndecoherence time. To generalize the Monte Carlo simulation results for any\nn-level quantum system, we further analyzed the change of brain entropy due to\nthe mind probing actions and proved a theorem according to which local\nprojections cannot decrease the von Neumann entropy of the unconditional brain\ndensity matrix. The latter theorem establishes that Stapp's model is physically\nimplausible but leaves a door open for future development of quantum mind\ntheories provided the brain has a decoherence-free subspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 20:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

The observed behavior\nof antineutron-nucleus annihilations is similar to what would be expected for\nantiproton-nucleus annihilations, where Coulomb attraction focusses antiproton\ntrajectories towards the nucleus, enhancing the inelastic cross section by a\nfactor O(1/p) with respect to antineutrons on the same target. This results in\na 1/p^2 behavior at small energies. The presence of a similar enhancement in\nthe antineutron case may only be justified by an interaction with a longer\nrange than strong interactions.
