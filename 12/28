For low-mass\nplanets in an isothermal disk, it is known that there is a strong negative\ntorque on the planet due to its linear perturbation to the disk, causing fast\ninward migration. The current investigation demonstrates that in these same\nisothermal disks, for intermediate-mass planets, there is a strong positive\nnonlinear corotation torque due to the effects of gas being pulled through a\ngap on horseshoe orbits. For intermediate-mass planets, this positive torque\ncan partially or completely cancel the linear (Type I) torque, leading to\nslower or outward migration, even in an isothermal disk. The effect is most\nsignificant for Super-Earth and Sub-Jovian planets, during the transition from\na low-mass linear perturber to a non-linear gap-opening planet, when the planet\nhas opened a so-called 'partial gap'.

Bayesian\nhierarchical models \\cite{Zhang:Efficient} learn user profiles jointly and have\nthe advantage of being able to borrow discriminative information from other\nusers through a Bayesian prior. However, the standard Bayesian hierarchical\nmodels assume all user profiles are generated from the same prior. Considering\nthe diversity of user interests, this assumption could be improved by\nintroducing more flexibility. Besides, most existing content-based filtering\napproaches implicitly assume that each user profile corresponds to exactly one\nuser interest and fail to capture a user's multiple interests (information\nneeds).\n  In this paper, we present a flexible Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach\nto model both commonality and diversity among users as well as individual\nusers' multiple interests. We propose two models each with different\nassumptions, and the proposed models are called Discriminative Factored Prior\nModels (DFPM). In our models, each user profile is modeled as a discriminative\nclassifier with a factored model as its prior, and different factors contribute\nin different levels to each user profile. Compared with existing content-based\nfiltering models, DFPM are interesting because they can 1) borrow\ndiscriminative criteria of other users while learning a particular user profile\nthrough the factored prior; 2) trade off well between diversity and commonality\namong users; and 3) handle the challenging classification situation where each\nclass contains multiple concepts.

The scalar\ncurvature R of the spacetime, which arises in the integrand of the\nEinstein-Hilbert functional, is replaced by a function f=f(R). The field\nequations involve up to fourth-order derivatives of the spacetime metric, and\nthe challenge is to understand the structure of these high-order terms. We\npropose a formulation of the initial value problem in modified gravity when the\ninitial data are prescribed on a hypersurface. In addition to the induced\nmetric and second fundamental form of the initial slice and the initial matter\ncontent, an initial data set must also provide the spacetime scalar curvature\nand its time-derivative. We introduce an augmented conformal formulation, as we\ncall it, in which the spacetime curvature is an independent variable. In the\nso-called wave gauge, the field equations of modified gravity reduce a coupled\nsystem of nonlinear wave-Klein-Gordon equations with defocusing potential,\nwhose unknowns are the conformally-transformed metric and the scalar curvature,\nas well as the matter fields. We are able to establish the existence of maximal\nglobally hyperbolic developments when the matter is represented by a scalar\nfield. We analyze the so-called Jordan coupling and work with the Einstein\nmetric, which is conformally equivalent to the physical metric --the conformal\nfactor depending upon the scalar curvature. Our analysis leads us to a rigorous\nvalidation of the theory of modified gravity. We derive quantitative estimates,\nwhich are uniform in terms of the nonlinearity f(R), and we prove that\nasymptotically flat spacetimes of modified gravity are `close' to Einstein\nspacetimes, when the function f(R) in the action functional of modified gravity\nis `close' to the Einstein-Hilbert integrand R.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Dec 2014 11:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

Optimality of Bayes estimates and posterior concentration\nproperties in terms of the minimax risk in the $l_2$ norm corresponding to a\nvery general class of continuous shrinkage priors are studied in this work. The\nclass of priors considered is rich enough to include a great variety of heavy\ntailed prior distributions, such as, the three parameter beta normal mixtures\n(including the horseshoe), the generalized double Pareto, the inverse gamma and\nthe normal-exponential-gamma priors.

Predictions fail when the orbital motion is included in the\nanalysis, because emitters and energy budgets that are too large are required.\nValues of X-ray and TeV fluxes that are too high are predicted in such a case,\nalong half of the orbit.\n  Conclusions: We show that the radiation in LS 5039 does not come from only\none electron population, and the emitter is likely extended and inhomogeneous\nwith a low magnetic field. We suggest that the emitter moves at relativistic\nvelocities with Doppler boosting playing a significant role.\n  Key words.

Many large stellar surveys have been and are still being carried\nout, providing huge amounts of data, for which stellar physical parameters will\nbe derived. Solar twins and analogues provide a means to test the calibration\nof these stellar catalogues because the Sun is the best-studied star and\nprovides precise fundamental parameters. Solar twins should be centred on the\nsolar values. Aims. This spectroscopic study of solar analogues selected from\nthe Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS) at a resolution of 48,000 provides effective\ntemperatures and metallicities for these stars. We test whether our\nspectroscopic parameters, as well as the previous photometric calibrations, are\nproperly centred on the Sun. In addition, we search for more solar twins in our\nsample. Methods. The methods used in this work are based on literature methods\nfor solar twin searches and on methods we developed in previous work to\ndistinguish the metallicity-temperature degeneracies in the differential\ncomparison of spectra of solar analogues versus a reference solar reflection\nspectrum. Results. We derive spectroscopic parameters for 148 solar analogues\n(about 70 are new entries to the literature) and verify with a-posteriori\ndifferential tests that our values are well-centred on the solar values. We use\nour dataset to assess the two alternative calibrations of the GCS parameters;\nour methods favour the latest revision. We show that the choice of spectral\nline list or the choice of asteroid or time of observation does not affect the\nresults. We also identify seven solar twins in our sample, three of which are\npublished here for the first time. Conclusions. Our methods provide an\nindependent means to differentially test the calibration of stellar catalogues\naround the values of a well-known benchmark star, which makes our work\ninteresting for calibration tests of upcoming Galactic surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Dec 2014 14:13:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 14:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-11"}
