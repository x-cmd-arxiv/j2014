A manifestation of\nthis effect is that in such a cosmology the turnaround radius has an upper\nbound. Recently, a new, local, test for the existence of dark energy in the\nform of a cosmological constant was proposed based on this turnaround bound.\nBefore designing an experiment that, through high-precision determination of\nmasses and turnaround radii, will challenge $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we have to\nanswer two important questions: first, when turnaround-scale structures are\npredicted to be close enough to their maximum size, so that a possible\nviolation of the bound may be observable. Second, which is the best mass scale\nto target for possible violations of the bound. Using the Press-Schechter\nformalism, we find that turnaround structures have in practice already stopped\nforming, and consequently, the turnaround radius of structures must be very\nclose to the maximum value today. We also find that the mass scale of $\\sim\n10^{13} M_\\odot$ characterizes turnaround structures that start to form in a\nstatistically important number density today. This mass scale also separates\nturnaround structures with different cosmological evolution: smaller structures\nare no longer readjusting their mass distribution inside the turnaround scale,\nthey asymptotically approach their ultimate abundance from higher values, and\nthey are common enough to have, at some epoch, experienced major mergers with\nstructures of comparable mass; larger structures exhibit the opposite behavior.\nWe call this mass scale the transitional mass scale and we argue that it is the\noptimal for the purpose outlined above.

However, this technique suffers from a major\ndrawback which is the high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the output\nsignals. In order to overcome this issue, several methods that require the\ntransmission of explicit Side Information (SI) bits have been proposed. In\nfact, the transmitted bits must be channel-encoded as they are particularly\ncritical to the performance of the considered OFDM system. This\nchannel-encoding highly increases the system complexity and also decreases the\ntransmission data rate. For these reasons, we propose in this paper, two robust\nblind techniques that embed the (SI) implicitly into the OFDM frame. First, we\ninvestigate a new technique referred as Blind Space Time Bloc Codes (BSTBC)\nthat is inspired from the conventional Selected Mapping (SLM) approach.

In recent times the research community has\nshown significant interest in modeling such interdependent networks and\nstudying the impact of failures on these networks. Although a number of models\nhave been proposed, many of them are simplistic in nature and fail to capture\nthe complex interdependencies that exist between the entities of these\nnetworks. To overcome the limitations, recently an Implicative Interdependency\nModel that utilizes Boolean Logic, was proposed and a number of problems were\nstudied. In this paper we study the entity hardening problem, where by entity\nhardening we imply the ability of the network operator to ensure that an\nadversary (be it Nature or human) cannot take a network entity from operative\nto inoperative state. Given that the network operator with a limited budget can\nonly harden k entities, the goal of the entity hardening problem is to identify\nthe set of k entities whose hardening will ensure maximum benefit for the\noperator, i.e. maximally reduce the ability of the adversary to degrade the\nnetwork. We show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time for some\ncases, whereas for others it is NP-complete. We provide the optimal solution\nusing ILP, and propose a heuristic approach to solve the problem. We evaluate\nthe efficacy of our heuristic using power and communication network data of\nMaricopa County, Arizona.

Recently, the use of the timing channel\nhas been proposed as a countermeasure to reactive jamming attacks performed by\nan energy-constrained malicious node. In fact, whilst a jammer is able to\ndisrupt the information contained in the attacked packets, timing information\ncannot be jammed and, therefore, timing channels can be exploited to deliver\ninformation to the receiver even on a jammed channel.\n  Since the nodes under attack and the jammer have conflicting interests, their\ninteractions can be modeled by means of game theory. Accordingly, in this paper\na game-theoretic model of the interactions between nodes exploiting the timing\nchannel to achieve resilience to jamming attacks and a jammer is derived and\nanalyzed. More specifically, the Nash equilibrium is studied in the terms of\nexistence, uniqueness, and convergence under best response dynamics.\nFurthermore, the case in which the communication nodes set their strategy and\nthe jammer reacts accordingly is modeled and analyzed as a Stackelberg game, by\nconsidering both perfect and imperfect knowledge of the jammer's utility\nfunction.

These methods study the pattern of allele sharing\namong modern and archaic genomes. They are sensitive to \"ghost\" admixture,\nwhich occurs when a population receives archaic DNA from sources not\nacknowledged by the statistical model. The effect of ghost admixture depends on\ntwo factors: branch-length bias and population-size bias. Branch-length bias\noccurs because a given amount of admixture has a larger effect if the two\npopulations have been separated for a long time. Population-size bias occurs\nbecause differences in population size distort branch lengths in the gene\ngenealogy. In the absence of ghost admixture, these effects are small. They\nbecome important, however, in the presence of ghost admixture. Estimators\ndiffer in the pattern of response. Increasing a given parameter may inflate one\nestimator but deflate another.

Namely, the metric becomes a direct sum of the\nmetric on a unit sphere and the metric of 2D anti-de Sitter space. The method\nof the heat kernels is used to find the Green function in this new space, that\nallows one, after dimensional reduction, to obtain a static Green function in\nthe original space of the static black hole. The general useful representation\nof static Green functions is obtained in the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini\nspacetimes of arbitrary dimension. The exact explicit expressions for the\nstatic Green functions are obtained in such metrics for D < 6. It is shown that\nin the four dimensional case the corresponding Green function coincides with\nthe Copson solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Dec 2014 03:17:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-23"}

For example, in the Prisoner's Dilemma, people often\ncooperate. Are there rules underlying cooperative behavior? In an effort to\nanswer this question, we propose a new equilibrium concept: perfect cooperative\nequilibrium (PCE), and two related variants: max-PCE and cooperative\nequilibrium. PCE may help explain players' behavior in games where cooperation\nis observed in practice. A player's payoff in a PCE is at least as high as in\nany NE. However, a PCE does not always exist. We thus consider {\\alpha}-PCE,\nwhere {\\alpha} takes into account the degree of cooperation; a PCE is a 0-PCE.\nEvery game has a Pareto-optimal max-PCE (M-PCE); that is, an {\\alpha}-PCE for a\nmaximum {\\alpha}. We show that M-PCE does well at predicting behavior in quite\na few games of interest. We also consider cooperative equilibrium (CE), another\ngeneralization of PCE that takes punishment into account. Interestingly, all\nPareto-optimal M-PCE are CE. We prove that, in 2-player games, a PCE (if it\nexists), a M-PCE, and a CE can all be found in polynomial time using bilinear\nprogramming. This is a contrast to Nash equilibrium, which is PPAD complete\neven in 2-player games [Chen, Deng, and Teng 2009]. We compare M-PCE to the\ncoco value [Kalai and Kalai 2009], another solution concept that tries to\ncapture cooperation, both axiomatically and in terms of an algebraic\ncharacterization, and show that the two are closely related, despite their very\ndifferent definitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Dec 2014 04:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-23"}

The vectors that result from the\nprojection can then be used as features in any classifier of choice.\nMathematically, I formulate the proposed method as the minimisation of an\nobjective function which can be interpreted, in the ANN output space, as a\nnegative factor of the sum of the squares of the pair-wise distances between\noutput vectors belonging to different classes, added to a positive factor of\nthe sum of squares of the pair-wise distances between output vectors belonging\nto the same classes, plus sparsity and weight decay terms.

PCA without discarding eigen- vector rows\npreserves pair-wise distances, but tends to cause pair-wise distances to shrink\nwhen eigenvector rows are discarded. 3). For any pair of points, the shrinkage\nin pair-wise distance is bounded above by an L1 norm reconstruction error\nassociated with the points.

Our proposals derive from the\nobservation that the SC framework enforces a one-to-one correspondence between\nsample points, and that this leads to two possible drawbacks. First, this\ndenies the framework the opportunity to effect advantageous many-to-many\nmatching between points on the two shapes being compared. Second, this calls\nfor the Hungarian algorithm which unfortunately usurps cubic time. While the\ndynamic-space-warping dynamic programming algorithm has provided a standard\nsolution to the first problem above, it demands quintic time for general\nmulti-contour shapes, and w times quadratic time for the special case of\nsingle-contour shapes, even after an heuristic search window of width w has\nbeen chosen. Therefore, in this work, we propose a simple method for computing\n\"many-to-many\" correspondences for the class of all 2-d shapes in quadratic\ntime. Our approach is to explicitly let each point on the first shape choose a\nbest match on the second shape, and vice versa. Along the way, we also propose\nthe use of data-clustering techniques for dealing with the outliers problem,\nand, from another viewpoint, it turns out that this clustering can be seen as\nan autonomous, rather than pre-computed, sampling of shape boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Dec 2014 10:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-23"}

Hence, related optimizations are currently\ncritical to improve the performance of applications requiring numerical\ncomputation. Moreover, the use of a Java run-time environment such as the\nHotSpot Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in high performance computing is a promising\nalternative. It benefits from its programming flexibility, productivity and the\nperformance is ensured by the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler. Though, the JIT\ncompiler suffers from two main drawbacks. First, the JIT is a black box for\ndevelopers. We have no control over the generated code nor any feedback from\nits optimization phases like vectorization. Secondly, the time constraint\nnarrows down the degree of optimization compared to static compilers like GCC\nor LLVM. So, it is compelling to use statically compiled code since it benefits\nfrom additional optimization reducing performance bottlenecks. Java enables to\ncall native code from dynamic libraries through the Java Native Interface\n(JNI). Nevertheless, JNI methods are not inlined and require an additional cost\nto be invoked compared to Java ones. Therefore, to benefit from better static\noptimization, this call overhead must be leveraged by the amount of computation\nperformed at each JNI invocation. In this paper we tackle this problem and we\npropose to do this analysis for a set of micro-kernels. Our goal is to select\nthe most efficient implementation considering the amount of computation defined\nby the calling context. We also investigate the impact on performance of\nseveral different optimization schemes which are vectorization, out-of-order\noptimization, data alignment, method inlining and the use of native memory for\nJNI methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Dec 2014 11:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-23"}

For plant traits heritability is\ntraditionally estimated by comparing within and between genotype variability.\nThis approach estimates broad-sense heritability, and does not account for\ndifferent genetic relatedness. With the availability of high-density markers\nthere is growing interest in marker based estimates of narrow-sense\nheritability, using mixed models in which genetic relatedness is estimated from\ngenetic markers. Such estimates have received much attention in human genetics\nbut are rarely reported for plant traits. A major obstacle is that current\nmethodology and software assume a single phenotypic value per genotype, hence\nrequiring genotypic means. An alternative that we propose here, is to use mixed\nmodels at individual plant or plot level. Using statistical arguments,\nsimulations and real data we investigate the feasibility of both approaches,\nand how these affect genomic prediction with G-BLUP and genome-wide association\nstudies. Heritability estimates obtained from genotypic means had very large\nstandard errors and were sometimes biologically unrealistic. Mixed models at\nindividual plant or plot level produced more realistic estimates, and for\nsimulated traits standard errors were up to 13 times smaller. Genomic\nprediction was also improved by using these mixed models, with up to a 49%\nincrease in accuracy. For GWAS on simulated traits, the use of individual plant\ndata gave almost no increase in power. The new methodology is applicable to any\ncomplex trait where multiple replicates of individual genotypes can be scored.\nThis includes important agronomic crops, as well as bacteria and fungi.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Dec 2014 13:15:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 11:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-17"}

These concepts play a key role in the the\ninterpretation of proofs as programs, a.k.a. the Curry-Howard correspondence,\nin the context of classical logic. Arising from linear logic, they allow the\nconstruction of meaningful semantics for cut-elimination in classical logic,\nsome of which relate to the Call-by-Name and Call-by-Value disciplines of\nfunctional programming. The first part of this dissertation provides an\nintroduction to these interpretations, highlighting the roles of polarities and\nfocussing. For instance: proofs of positive formulae provide structured data,\nwhile proofs of negative formulae consume such data; focussing allows the\ndescription of the interaction between the two kinds of proofs as pure\npattern-matching. This idea is pushed further in the second part of this\ndissertation, and connected to realisability semantics, where the structured\ndata is interpreted algebraically, and the consumption of such data is modelled\nwith the use of an orthogonality relation. Most of this part has been proved in\nthe Coq proof assistant. Polarities and focussing were also introduced with\napplications to logic programming in mind, where computation is proof-search.\nIn the third part of this dissertation, we push this idea further by exploring\nthe roles that these concepts can play in other applications of proof-search,\nsuch as theorem proving and more particularly automated reasoning. We use these\nconcepts to describe the main algorithm of SAT-solvers and SMT-solvers: DPLL.\nWe then describe the implementation of a proof-search engine called Psyche. Its\narchitecture, based on the concept of focussing, offers a platform where smart\ntechniques from automated reasoning (or a user interface) can safely and\ntrustworthily be implemented via the use of an API.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Dec 2014 13:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-23"}

We prove that it can be converted into the\nproblem of equivalence of two permutation-symmetric states, not necessarily\nrestricted to the same operation on all parties. We show that the problem can\nbe formulated in terms of symmetries of complex polynomials of many variables,\nand provide two families of invariants, which are straightforward to compute\nand provide analytical results.\n  Second, we study a family of recursive visualization schemes for\nmany-particle systems, for which we have coined the name 'qubism'. While all\nmany-qudit states can be plotted with qubism, it is especially useful for spin\nchains and one-dimensional translationally invariant states. This symmetry\nresults in self-similarity of the plot, making it more comprehensible and\nallowing to discover certain structures.\n  Third, we study quantum walks of a single particle on graphs, which are\nclassical analogues of random walks. Our focus is on the long-time limit of the\nprobability distribution and we study how (especially in the long-time limit)\noff-diagonal elements of the density matrix behave. We use them to perform\nquantum community detection - splitting of a graph into subgraphs in such a way\nthat the coherence between them is small. Our method captures properties that\nclassical methods cannot - the impact of constructive and destructive\ninterference, as well as the dependence of the results on the tunneling phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Dec 2014 15:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-23"}

In a C-RAN,\na central unit (CU) performs the baseband processing for a cluster of radio\nunits (RUs) that receive compressed baseband samples from the CU through\nlow-latency fronthaul links. Most previous works on the design of fronthaul\ncompression and precoding assume constant channels and instantaneous channel\nstate information (CSI) at the CU. This work, in contrast, concentrates on a\nmore practical scenario with block-ergodic channels and considers either\ninstantaneous or stochastic CSI at the CU. Moreover, the analysis encompasses\nboth the Compression-After-Precoding (CAP) and the Compression-Before-Precoding\n(CBP) schemes. With the CAP approach, which is the standard C-RAN solution, the\nCU performs channel coding and precoding and then the CU compresses and\nforwards the resulting baseband signals on the fronthaul links to the RUs. With\nthe CBP scheme, instead, the CU does not perform precoding but rather forwards\nseparately the information messages of a subset of mobile stations (MSs) along\nwith the compressed precoding matrices to the each RU, which then performs\nprecoding. Optimization algorithms over fronthaul compression and precoding for\nboth CAP and CBP are proposed that are based on a stochastic successive\nupper-bound minimization approach.

It is based on the analytically\ndetermined threshold that precisely separates signal and non-signal components\nin the 2D DFT domain. The algorithm operates fast in a single iteration\nproviding the accurate signal reconstruction. In the situations that are not\ncomprised by the analytic derivation and constrains, the algorithm is still\nefficient and need just a couple of iterations. The proposed solution shows\npromising results in ISAR imaging (simulated data are used), where the\nreconstruction is achieved even in the case when less than 10% of data is\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Dec 2014 12:44:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2015 17:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}
