Laboratory experiments and\nnumerical simulations have demonstrated that heavy particles respond in\nintricate ways to turbulent fluctuations of the carrying fluid: non-interacting\nparticles may cluster together and form spatial patterns even though the fluid\nis incompressible, and the relative speeds of nearby particles can fluctuate\nstrongly. Both phenomena depend sensitively on the parameters of the system.\nThis parameter dependence is difficult to model from first principles since\nturbulence plays an essential role. Laboratory experiments are also very\ndifficult, precisely since they must refer to a turbulent environment. But in\nrecent years it has become clear that important aspects of the dynamics of\nheavy particles in turbulence can be understood in terms of statistical models\nwhere the turbulent fluctuations are approximated by Gaussian random functions\nwith appropriate correlation functions. In this review we summarise how such\nstatistical-model calculations have led to a detailed understanding of the\nfactors that determine heavy-particle dynamics in turbulence. We concentrate on\nspatial clustering of heavy particles in turbulence. This is an important\nquestion because spatial clustering affects the collision rate between the\nparticles and thus the long-term fate of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 16:04:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 11:11:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 08:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Often, the entities involved in the data\nmining process are end-users or organizations with limited computing and\nstorage resources. As a result, such entities may want to refrain from\nparticipating in the PPDM process. To overcome this issue and to take many\nother benefits of cloud computing, outsourcing PPDM tasks to the cloud\nenvironment has recently gained special attention. We consider the scenario\nwhere n entities outsource their databases (in encrypted format) to the cloud\nand ask the cloud to perform the clustering task on their combined data in a\nprivacy-preserving manner. We term such a process as privacy-preserving and\noutsourced distributed clustering (PPODC).

The main novelty of our solution lies in avoiding the secure\ndivision operations required in computing cluster centers altogether through an\nefficient transformation technique. Our solution builds the clusters securely\nin an iterative fashion and returns the final cluster centers to all entities\nwhen a pre-determined termination condition holds. The proposed solution\nprotects data confidentiality of all the participating entities under the\nstandard semi-honest model. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first\nwork to discuss and propose a comprehensive solution to the PPODC problem that\nincurs negligible cost on the participating entities.

However, most research so far has been focused on metallic bulk\nmaterials that are known to possess ultra-high mobility and giant\nmagnetoresistance but limited carrier transport tunability.

Compressive sensing (CS) is a novel data\nacquisition method whereby the compression is done in a sensor simultaneously\nwith the sampling. If the original sensed signal is sufficiently sparse in\nterms of some basis, the decompression can be done essentially perfectly up to\nsome critical compression ratio. In this article, a Bayesian compressive\nsensing (BCS) method is investigated that uses sparse Bayesian learning to\nreconstruct signals from a compressive sensor. By explicitly quantifying the\nuncertainty in the reconstructed signal, the BCS technique exhibits an obvious\nbenefit over existing regularized norm-minimization CS methods that provide a\nsingle signal estimate. However, current BCS algorithms suffer from a\nrobustness problem: sometimes the reconstruction errors are very large when the\nnumber of measurements is a lot less than the number of signal degrees of\nfreedom that are needed to capture the signal accurately in a directly sampled\nform. In this paper, we present improvements to the BCS reconstruction method\nto enhance its robustness so that even higher compression ratios can be used\nand we examine the tradeoff between efficiently compressing data and accurately\ndecompressing it. Synthetic data and actual acceleration data collected from a\nbridge SHM system are used as examples. Compared with the state-of-the-art BCS\nreconstruction algorithms, the improved BCS algorithm demonstrates superior\nperformance. With the same reconstruction error, the proposed BCS algorithm\nworks with relatively large compression ratios and it can achieve perfect\nlossless compression performance with quite high compression ratios.\nFurthermore, the error bars for the signal reconstruction are also quantified\neffectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 17:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}

Many prior CoMP works do not consider\ninter-cell overhead message delays such that a seemingly astonishing CoMP\nthroughput gain is attained. In this paper, the quantization error and delay\nthat actually exist in overhead messages was modeled and we developed a much\ntractable SIR model based on the stochastic geometry framework. We proposed\nadaptive CoMP that is applied to downlink zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and\nit can mitigate the interference from the coordinated cells with delayed\noverhead messages. The bounds on the complementary cumulative distribution\nfunction (CCDF) of the SIR of a user are characterized such that the average\nthroughput of a user is able to be analytically evaluated.

Owing to the mixing of\ndifferent partial wave channels, scattering with SOC is in general a coupled\nmultichannel problem. A systematic method is introduced to analytically solve a\nclass of coupled differential equations by recasting the coupled channel\nproblem as a simple eigenvalue problem. The exact Green's matrix in the\npresence of SOC is found, which readily gives the scattering solutions for any\ntwo identical particles in any total angular momentum subspace having\nnegligible center of mass momentum. Application of this formalism to two spin-1\nbosons shows the ubiquitous low energy threshold behavior for systems with\nisotropic SOC. A modified threshold behavior shows up, which does not occur for\nthe spin-orbit coupled spin-1/2 system. We also confirm the parity-breaking\nmechanism for the spontaneous emergency of handedness, that has been proposed\nby Duan et. al. [1].

Our\nidentified candidate, Ba$_2$BiTaO$_6$, has an optical band gap larger than 4 eV\nand a Hall hole mobility above 30 cm$^2$/Vs. We rationalize this finding with\nmolecular orbital intuitions; Bi$^{3+}$ with filled s-orbitals strongly overlap\nwith the oxygen p, increasing the extent of the metal-oxygen covalency and\neffectively reducing the valence effective mass, while Ta$^{5+}$ forms a\nconduction band with low electronegativity, leading to a high band gap beyond\nthe visible range. Our concerted theory-experiment effort points to the growing\nutility of a data-driven materials discovery and the combination of both\ninformatics and chemical intuitions as a way to discover future technological\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 00:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

The origin of these close-in\nsuper-Earths and mini-Neptunes is a major unanswered question in planet\nformation. Unlike Earth, whose atmosphere contains $<10^{-6}$ its total mass, a\nlarge fraction of close-in planets have significant gaseous envelopes,\ncontaining $1 -10\\%$ or more of their total mass. It has been proposed that\nthese close-in planets formed in situ either by delivery of $50-100M_{\\oplus}$\nof rocky material to the inner disc, or in a disc enhanced relative to the\nMMSN. In both cases, final assembly of the planets occurs by giant impacts\n(GIs). Here we test the viability of these scenarios. We show that atmospheres\naccreted by isolation masses are small ($10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ the core mass) and\nthat atmospheric mass-loss during GIs is significant, with typical post-GI\natmospheres that are $8 \\times 10^{-4}$ the core mass. Such values are\nconsistent with terrestrial planet atmospheres but more than an order of\nmagnitude below atmospheric masses of $1-10\\%$ inferred for many close-in\nexoplanets. In the most optimistic scenario with no core luminosity, post-GI\nenvelope accretion from a depleted gas disc yields atmospheric masses that are\nseveral per cent the core mass. If the gravitational potential energy due to\nthe last mass doubling of the planet by GIs is released over the disc\ndissipation time-scale as core luminosity, then envelope masses are reduced by\nabout an order of magnitude. Finally we show that radial drift time-scales due\nto gas drag for many isolation masses are shorter than typical disc lifetimes.\nGiven these challenges, we conclude that most observed close-in planets with\nenvelopes larger than several per cent likely formed at larger separations from\ntheir host stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 01:23:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 06:50:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 17:52:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 00:04:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2016 22:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Evaluating a query on a graph results in a relation on the set of its\nnodes. In other words, a query is a mechanism for defining relations on a\ngraph. Some relations may not be definable by any query in a given language.\nThis leads to the following question: given a graph, a query language and a\nrelation on the graph, does there exist a query in the language that defines\nthe relation? This is called the definability problem. When the given query\nlanguage is standard regular expressions, the definability problem is known to\nbe PSPACE-complete.\n  The model of graphs can be extended by labeling nodes with values from an\ninfinite domain. These labels induce a partition on the set of nodes: two nodes\nare equivalent if they are labeled by the same value. Query languages can also\nbe extended to make use of this equivalence. Two such extensions are Regular\nExpressions with Memory (REM) and Regular Expressions with Equality (REE).\n  In this paper, we study the complexity of the definability problem in this\nextended model when the query language is either REM or REE.

A long-standing issue that has been seen here is significant\ninstrumental Stokes leakage after calibration, particularly in Stokes Q at high\nfrequencies. A simple model that accounts for inter-element mutual coupling is\npresented which explains the prominence of Q leakage seen when the array is\nscanned away from zenith in the principal planes. On these planes, the model\npredicts current imbalance in the X (E-W) and Y (N-S) dipoles and hence the Q\nleakage. Although helpful in concept, we find that this model is inadequate to\nexplain the full details of the observation data. This finding motivates\nfurther experimentation with more rigorous models that account for both mutual\ncoupling and embedded element patterns. Two more rigorous models are discussed:\nthe \"full\" and \"average\" embedded element patterns. The viability of the \"full\"\nmodel is demonstrated by simulating current MWA practice of using a Hertzian\ndipole model as a Jones matrix estimate. We find that these results replicate\nthe observed Q leakage to approximately 2 to 5%.

On the\nother hand, the QCD vacuum instantons generate heavy-light quark interactions\nterms, which are responsible for the effects of S\\chiSB in a heavy-light quark\nsystem. Summing the re-scattering series that lead to the total light quark\npropagator and making few further steps, we get the fermionized representation\nof low-frequencies light quark determinant in the presence of the quark\nsources, which is relevant for our problems. The next important step in the\nline of this strategy is to derive the equation and calculate the heavy quark\npropagator in the instanton media and in the presence of light quarks.

The main reason for the\nfeasibility to develop such a high-order scheme with compact stencil, which\ninvolves only neighboring cells, is due to the use of a high-order gas\nevolution model. Besides the evaluation of the time-dependent flux function\nacross a cell interface, the high-order gas evolution model also provides an\naccurate time-dependent solution of the flow variables at a cell interface.\nTherefore, the current scheme not only updates the cell averaged conservative\nflow variables inside each control volume, but also tracks the flow variables\nat the cell interface at the next time level. As a result, with both cell\naveraged and cell interface values the high-order reconstruction in the current\nscheme can be done compactly. Different from using a weak formulation for\nhigh-order accuracy in the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, the current\nscheme is based on the strong solution, where the flow evolution starting from\na piecewise discontinuous high-order initial data is precisely followed. The\ncell interface time-dependent flow variables can be used for the initial data\nreconstruction at the beginning of next time step. Even with compact stencil,\nthe current scheme has third-order accuracy in the smooth flow regions, and has\nfavorable shock capturing property in the discontinuous regions. Many test\ncases are used to validate the current scheme. In comparison with many other\nhigh-order schemes, the current method avoids the use of Gaussian points for\nthe flux evaluation along the cell interface and the multi-stage Runge-Kutta\ntime stepping technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 07:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}

For pixelwise classification tasks, such as image segmentation and\nobject detection, surrounding image patches are fed into CNN for predicting the\nclasses of centered pixels via forward propagation and for updating CNN\nparameters via backward propagation. However, forward and backward propagation\nwas originally designed for whole-image classification. Directly applying it to\npixelwise classification in a patch-by-patch scanning manner is extremely\ninefficient, because surrounding patches of pixels have large overlaps, which\nlead to a lot of redundant computation.\n  The proposed algorithms eliminate all the redundant computation in\nconvolution and pooling on images by introducing novel d-regularly sparse\nkernels. It generates exactly the same results as those by patch-by-patch\nscanning. Convolution and pooling operations with such kernels are able to\ncontinuously access memory and can run efficiently on GPUs. A fraction of\npatches of interest can be chosen from each training image for backward\npropagation by applying a mask to the error map at the last CNN layer. Its\ncomputation complexity is constant with respect to the number of patches\nsampled from the image.

We show, both theoretically and numerically that, when all the\nparticles have been trapped in the wave potential, the distribution in action\nexhibits a very sharp peak about the smallest action. Moreover, as the wave\nkeeps growing, the most probable action tends towards a constant, $I_f$, which\nwe estimate theoretically. In particular, we show that $I_f$ may be calculated\nvery accurately, when the particles' motion before trapping is far from\nadiabatic, by making use of a perturbation analysis in the wave amplitude. This\nfills a gap regarding the computation of the action change which, in the past,\nhas only been addressed for slowly varying dynamics. Moreover, when the\nvariations of the dynamics are fast enough, we show that the Fourier components\nof the particles' distribution function can be calculated by connecting\nestimates from our perturbation analysis with those obtained by assuming that\nall the particles have the same constant action, $I=I_f$. This result is used\nto compute theoretically the imaginary part of the electron susceptibility of\nan electrostatic wave in a plasma. Moreover, using our formula for the electron\nsusceptibility, we can extend the range in $\\epsilon_a$ (the parameter that\nquantifies the slowness of the dynamics) for our perturbative estimate of\n$I_f-I_0$. This range can actually be pushed down to values of $\\epsilon_a$\nallowing the use of neo-adiabatic techniques to compute the jump in action.\nHence, this paper shows that the action change due to trapping can be\ncalculated theoretically, whatever the rate of variation of the dynamics, by\nconnecting perturbative results with neo-adiabatic ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 13:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In our previous work we found that in\nflows surrounding supermassive black holes, thermal synchrotron radiation is\nnot capable of providing a sufficient seed photons flux to explain the X-ray\nspectral indices as well as the cut-off energies measured in several\nbest-studied AGNs. In this work we complete the model by including seed photons\nprovided by nonthermal synchrotron radiation and we find that it allows to\nreconcile the hot flow model with the AGN data. We take into account two\npossible sources of nonthermal electrons. First, we consider e+- produced by\ncharged-pions decay, which should be always present in the innermost part of a\ntwo-temperature flow due to proton-proton interactions. We find that for a weak\nheating of thermal electrons (small delta) the synchrotron emission of\npion-decay e+- is much stronger than the thermal synchrotron emission in the\nconsidered range of bolometric luminosities, L Ledd.

To improve the scalability of\nC-RAN networks, it is very important to take the fronthaul loading into\nconsideration in the signal detection, and it is very desirable to reduce the\nfronthaul loading in C-RAN systems. In this paper, we consider uplink C-RAN\nsystems and we propose a distributed fronthaul compression scheme at the\ndistributed RRHs and a joint recovery algorithm at the BBUs by deploying the\ntechniques of distributed compressive sensing (CS). Different from conventional\ndistributed CS, the CS problem in C-RAN system needs to incorporate the\nunderlying effect of multi-access fading for the end-to-end recovery of the\ntransmitted signals from the users.

Spectral fitting of neutron star atmosphere models to the\nthermal component is one of the leading methods for measuring the neutron star\nradius. However, it has been known for years that the X-ray spectra of\nquiescent neutron stars vary between observations. While most quiescent\nvariability is explained through a variable power-law component, the brightest\nand best-studied object, Cen X-4, requires a change in the thermal component\nand such thermal variability could be a problem for measuring neutron star\nradii.

This notion can be generalized to the confinement of a system into a\nmanifold of quantum states, consisting of all coherent superpositions of\nmultiple stable steady states. We have experimentally confined the state of a\nharmonic oscillator to the quantum manifold spanned by two coherent states of\nopposite phases.

We investigate the occurrence rate of substellar\ncompanions around giant stars as a function of stellar mass and metallicity. We\nprobe the stellar mass range from about 1 to beyond 3 M_Sun, which is not being\nexplored by main-sequence samples. We fit the giant planet occurrence rate as a\nfunction of stellar mass and metallicity with a Gaussian and an exponential\ndistribution, respectively. We find strong evidence for a planet-metallicity\ncorrelation among the secure planet hosts of our giant star sample, in\nagreement with the one for main-sequence stars. However, the planet-metallicity\ncorrelation is absent for our sample of planet candidates, raising the\nsuspicion that a good fraction of them might indeed not be planets. Consistent\nwith the results obtained by Johnson for subgiants, the giant planet occurrence\nrate increases in the stellar mass interval from 1 to 1.9 M_Sun. However, there\nis a maximum at a stellar mass of 1.9 +0.1/-0.5 M_Sun, and the occurrence rate\ndrops rapidly for masses larger than 2.5-3.0 M_Sun. We do not find any planets\naround stars more massive than 2.7 M_Sun, although there are 113 stars with\nmasses between 2.7 and 5 M_Sun in our sample (corresponding to a giant planet\noccurrence rate < 1.6% at 68.3% confidence in that stellar mass bin). We also\nshow that this result is not a selection effect related to the planet\ndetectability being a function of the stellar mass. We conclude that giant\nplanet formation or inward migration is suppressed around higher mass stars,\npossibly because of faster disk depletion coupled with a longer migration\ntimescale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 15:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

In addition to the well known substructures, e.g.,\nSirius, Coma Berenices, Hyades-Pleiades over-densities, several new\nsubstructures are unveiled. A ripple-like structure from (U, V) = (-120, -5) to\n(103, -32)km/s is clearly seen in the U-V distribution. This structure seems\nassociated with resonance induced by the Galactic bar, since it is extended in\nU while having a small dispersion in V at the same time. A ridge structure\nbetween (U, V) = (-60, 40) and (-15, 15) km/s is also found. Although similar\nsubstructures have been seen in the Hipparcos data, their origin is still\nunclear. Another compact over-density is seen at (U, V) = (-102, -24). With\nthis large data sample, we find that the substructure located at V~70 km/s and\nthe Arcturus group are essentially parallel in V, which may indicate that they\noriginate from an unrelaxed disk component perturbed by the rotating bar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 04:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-17"}

Each CSS rule consists of a node selector (given in an\nXPath-like query language) and a declaration block (assigning values to\nselected nodes' display attributes). As web applications evolve, maintaining\nCSS files can easily become problematic. Some CSS rules will be replaced by new\nones, but these obsolete (hence redundant) CSS rules often remain in the\napplications. Not only does this \"bloat\" the applications, but it also\nsignificantly increases web browsers' processing time. Most works on detecting\nredundant CSS rules in HTML5 applications do not consider the dynamic behaviors\nof HTML5 (specified in JavaScript); in fact, the only proposed method that\ntakes these into account is dynamic analysis (a.k.a. testing), which cannot\nsoundly prove redundancy of CSS rules. In this paper, we introduce an\nabstraction of HTML5 applications based on monotonic tree-rewriting and study\nits \"redundancy problem\". We establish the precise complexity of the problem\nand various subproblems of practical importance (ranging from P to EXP). In\nparticular, our algorithm relies on an efficient reduction to an analysis of\nsymbolic pushdown systems (for which highly optimised solvers are available),\nwhich yields a fast method for checking redundancy in practice.

It is proposed to use the examined\npacking of balls as an initial condition for the calculations by the Discrete\nElements Method (DEM) in technological processes in the fluidized bed in\nindustry, as well as in the modeling of processes that occur in hydraulic and\npneumatic transport of granular materials. Filtration properties of such\npacking required for its use as an initial condition in calculations by DEM are\nestimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 12:20:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 12:13:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 07:25:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}
