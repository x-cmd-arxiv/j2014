In particular,\nthey can be used for computing the so-called reactive trajectories\ncorresponding to direct transitions from one metastable state to another. The\nalgorithm is based on successive selection-mutation steps performed on the\nsystem in a controlled way. It has two intrinsic parameters, the number of\nparticles/trajectories and the reaction coordinate used for discriminating good\nor bad trajectories. We investigate first the convergence in law of the\nalgorithm as a function of the timestep for several simple stochastic models.\nSecond, we consider the average duration of reactive trajectories for which no\ntheoretical predictions exist. The most important aspect of this work concerns\nsome systems with two degrees of freedom. They are studied in details as a\nfunction of the reaction coordinate in the asymptotic regime where the number\nof trajectories goes to infinity. We show that during phase transitions, the\nstatistics of the algorithm deviate significatively from known theoretical\nresults when using non-optimal reaction coordinates. In this case, the variance\nof the algorithm is peaking at the transition and the convergence of the\nalgorithm can be much slower than the usual expected central limit behavior.\nThe duration of trajectories is affected as well. Moreover, reactive\ntrajectories do not correspond to the most probable ones. Such behavior\ndisappears when using the optimal reaction coordinate called committor as\npredicted by the theory. We finally investigate a three-state Markov chain\nwhich reproduces this phenomenon and show logarithmic convergence of the\ntrajectory durations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 16:45:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 13:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-25"}

We show that this model contains four different\neffective spin-1 SPT phases, corresponding to different representations of the\n$(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2) + T$ symmetry group, where $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nis some $\\pi$-rotation in the spin internal space and $T$ is time-reversal. One\nof these phases is equivalent to the usual spin-1 Haldane phase, while the\nother three are different but also typical of spin-1 systems. The model also\nexhibits an $SO(5)$-Haldane phase. Moreover, we also find that the transitions\nbetween the different effective spin-1 SPT phases are continuous, and can be\ndescribed by a $c=2$ conformal field theory. At such transitions, indirect\nevidence suggests a possible effective field theory of four massless Majorana\nfermions. The results are obtained by approximating the ground state of the\nsystem in the thermodynamic limit using Matrix Product States via the infinite\nTime Evolving Block Decimation method, as well as by effective field theory\nconsiderations.

For multi-dimensional bounded\ndomains, we prove the global existence and boundedness of time-dependent\nsolutions. For one-dimensional finite domains, we study the effect of diffusion\nand advection on the existence and stability of nonconstant positive steady\nstates to the strongly coupled elliptic system. In particular, our stability\nresult of these nontrivial steady states provides a selection mechanism for\nstable wavemodes of the time-dependent system. In the limit of diffusion rates,\nwe show that the steady states of this full elliptic system can be approximated\nby nonconstant positive solutions of a shadow system and then we construct\nboundary spike solutions to this shadow system.

This is troubling\nbecause, in the context of LCDM cosmologies, all galaxies should have a large\ndark matter component. We use penalised pixel fitting software to extract\nvelocities and velocity dispersions from GMOS slit mask spectra. Using Jeans\nand MONDian modelling we produce best fit models to the velocity dispersion. We\nfind that NGC 7507 has a two component stellar halo, with the outer halo and\ninner haloes counter rotating. The velocity dispersion profile exhibits an\nincrease at ~70\" (~7.9 kpc), reminiscent of several other elliptical galaxies.\nOur best fit models are those under mild anisotropy which include ~100 times\nless dark matter than predicted by LCDM, although mildly anisotropic models\nthat are completely dark matter free fit almost equally well. Our MONDian\nmodels, both isotropic and anisotropic, systematically fail to reproduce the\nmeasured velocity dispersions at almost all radii. The counter rotating outer\nhalo implies a merger remnant, as does the increase in velocity dispersion at\n~70\". From simulations it seems plausible that the merger that caused the\nincrease in velocity dispersion was a spiral-spiral merger. Our Jeans models\nare completely consistent with a no dark matter scenario, however, some dark\nmatter can be accommodated, although at much lower concentrations that\npredicted by LCDM simulations. This indicates that NGC 7507 may be a dark\nmatter free elliptical galaxy. Whether NGC 7507 is completely dark matter free\nor very dark matter poor, this is at odds with predictions from current LCDM\ncosmological simulations. It may be possible that the observed velocity\ndispersions could be reproduced if the galaxy is significantly flattened along\nthe line of sight (e.g. due to rotation), however, invoking this flattening is\nproblematic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 18:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In this study, we\nexplore students ideas of electric fields pre-instruction as shown by students\nrepresentations produced in open-ended activities. 92 participant students\ncompleted a worksheet that involved drawing comic strips about electric charges\nas characters of a cartoon series. Three students who had spontaneously\nproduced arrow diagrams were interviewed individually after class.

In this paper, we describe\nin detail each idea and its situated context. As most research in the\nliterature has understood students as having relatively fixed conceptions and\nmostly identified divergences in those conceptions from canonical targets, this\nstudy shows students reasoning to be more variable in particular moments, and\nthat variability includes common sense resources that can be productive for\nlearning about electric fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 18:51:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 20:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

Following this sentiment, we train deep\nconvolutional neural networks to play Go by training them to predict the moves\nmade by expert Go players. To solve this problem we introduce a number of novel\ntechniques, including a method of tying weights in the network to 'hard code'\nsymmetries that are expect to exist in the target function, and demonstrate in\nan ablation study they considerably improve performance. Our final networks are\nable to achieve move prediction accuracies of 41.1% and 44.4% on two different\nGo datasets, surpassing previous state of the art on this task by significant\nmargins. Additionally, while previous move prediction programs have not yielded\nstrong Go playing programs, we show that the networks trained in this work\nacquired high levels of skill. Our convolutional neural networks can\nconsistently defeat the well known Go program GNU Go, indicating it is state of\nthe art among programs that do not use Monte Carlo Tree Search.

In this paper we investigate whether planets can be held\nresponsible for the excitation mechanism of the observed spirals. We use\nlocally isothermal hydrodynamic simulations as well as analytic formulae to\nmodel the spiral waves launched by planets. Then H-band scattered light images\nare calculated using a 3D continuum radiative transfer code to study the effect\nof surface density and pressure scale height perturbation on the detectability\nof the spirals.

This value is a factor of eight higher than what is seen in\nhydrodynamic simulations. We also find that a relative change of only 0.2 in\npressure scale height is sufficient to create detectable signatures under the\nsame conditions.

We would\nlike to locate a facility on a closed interval. There are n agents located on\nthat interval, divided into two types: type 1 agents, who wish for the facility\nto be as far from them as possible, and type 2 agents, who wish for the\nfacility to be as close to them as possible. Our goal is to maximize a form of\naggregated social benefit: maxisum- the sum of the agents' utilities, or the\negalitarian objective- the minimal agent utility. The strategic aspect of the\nproblem is that the agents' locations are not known to us, but rather reported\nto us by the agents- an agent might misreport his location in an attempt to\nmove the facility away from or towards to his true location. We therefore\nrequire the facility-locating mechanism to be strategyproof, namely that\nreporting truthfully is a dominant strategy for each agent. As simply\nmaximizing the social benefit is generally not strategyproof, our goal is to\ndesign strategyproof mechanisms with good approximation ratios.\n  For the maxisum objective, in the deterministic setting, we provide a\nbest-possible 3- approximate strategyproof mechanism; in the randomized\nsetting, we provide a 23/13- approximate strategyproof mechanism and a lower\nbound of \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}. For the egalitarian objective, we provide a lower\nbound of 3/2 in the randomized setting, and show that no bounded approximation\nratio is attainable in the deterministic setting. To obtain our deterministic\nlower bounds, we characterize all deterministic strategyproof mechanisms when\nall agents are of type 1. Finally, we consider a generalized model that allows\nan agent to control more than one location, and provide best-possible 3- and\n3/2- approximate strategyproof mechanisms for maxisum, in the deterministic and\nrandomized settings respectively, when only type 1 agents are present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 19:08:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2015 18:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-20"}

By manipulating and\nutilizing the entire dataset of \"atlases\" (training images that have been\npreviously labeled, e.g., manually by an expert), rather than some model-based\naverage representation, MAS has the flexibility to better capture anatomical\nvariation, thus offering superior segmentation accuracy.

Nanongkai presented in [STOC'14] a randomized\n$(2+o(1))$-approximation algorithm to compute all pairs shortest paths (APSP)\nin time $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ on weighted graphs, where we use the convention\nthat $\\tilde{\\Omega}(f(n))$ is essentially $\\Omega(f(n)/$polylog$f(n))$ and\n$\\tilde{O}(f(n))$ is essentially $O(f(n) $polylog$f(n))$.

It is usual to model the mass distribution and use time-delay\nobservations to infer cosmological parameters, but it is naturally also\npossible to take the cosmological parameters as given and use time delays as\nconstraints on the mass distribution. This paper develops a method to isolate\nwhat exactly those constraints are, using a principal-components analysis of\nensembles of free-form mass models. We find that time delays provide tighter\nconstraints on the distribution of matter in the very high dense regions of the\nlensing clusters. We apply it to the cluster lens SDSS J1004+4112, whose rich\nlensing data includes two time delays. We find, assuming a concordance\ncosmology, that the time delays constrain the central region of the cluster to\nbe rounder and less lopsided than would be allowed by lensed images alone. This\ndetailed information about the distribution of the matter is very useful for\nstudying the dense regions of the galaxy clusters which are very difficult to\nstudy with direct measurements. A further time-delay measurement, which is\nexpected, will make this system even more interesting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 21:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The stabilities of the binding structures are further confirmed by\nperforming ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations at elevated temperatures,\nexcept for stanene which is subject to structural instability upon the\nadsorption of adatoms. Depending on the row number of the adatoms and\nsubstrates we find three types of binding structures, which lead to significant\nchanges in the electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of substrates. In\nparticular, Si, Ge and Sn adatoms adsorbed on silicene and germanene form\ndumbbell structures. Furthermore, dumbbell structures occur not only on single\nlayer, monatomic honeycomb structures, but also on their compounds like SiC and\nSiGe. We show that the energy barrier to the migration of a dumbbell structure\nis low due to the concerted action of atoms. This renders dumbbells rather\nmobile on substrates to construct new single and multilayer Si and Ge phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 21:53:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-12"}

We develop a new particle filter, called the\n\\emph{space-time particle filter}, for a specific family of state-space models\nin discrete time. This new class of particle filters provide consistent Monte\nCarlo estimates for any fixed $d$, as do standard particle filters. Moreover,\nwe expect that the state-space particle filter will scale much better with $d$\nthan the standard filter. We illustrate this analytically for a model of a\nsimple i.i.d. structure and one of a Markovian structure in the $d$-dimensional\nspace-direction, when we show that the algorithm exhibits certain stability\nproperties as $d$ increases at a cost $\\mathcal{O}(nNd^2)$, where $n$ is the\ntime parameter and $N$ is the number of Monte Carlo samples, that are fixed and\nindependent of $d$. Similar results are expected to hold, under a more general\nstructure than the i.i.d.~one. independently of the dimension. Our theoretical\nresults are also supported by numerical simulations on practical models of\ncomplex structures. The results suggest that it is indeed possible to tackle\nsome high dimensional filtering problems using the space-time particle filter\nthat standard particle filters cannot handle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 00:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-12"}

This leads\nto Cohen's $d$ estimates for which interpretation is simple. However, this\nsimplicity should not be used as a justification for the assumption of equal\nvariances in situations where evidence may suggest that it is incorrect. Until\nnow, researchers have either used an $F$-test for each individual study as a\njustification for the equality of variances or perhaps even conveniently\nignored such tools altogether. In this paper we propose using a meta-analysis\nof F-test statistics to estimate the ratio of variances prior to the\ncombination of SMD's. This procedure allows some studies to be included that\nmight otherwise be omitted by individual fixed level tests for unequal\nvariances, sometimes occur even when the assumption of equal variances holds.\nThe estimated ratio of variances, as well as associated confidence intervals,\ncan be used as guidance as to whether the assumption of equal variances is\nviolated. The estimators considered include variance stabilization\ntransformations (VST) of the $F$-test statistics as well as MLE estimators. The\nVST approaches enable the use of QQ-plots to visually inspect for violations of\nequal variances while the MLE estimator easily allows for the introduction of a\nrandom effect. When there is evidence of unequal variances, this work provides\na means to formally justify the use of less common methods such as log ratio of\nmeans when studies are measured on a different scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 00:05:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2015 22:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-14"}

In this work we argue\nthat the fermion bag also gives insight into a new mechanism of fermion mass\ngeneration, especially at strong couplings where fermion masses are related to\nthe fermion bag size. On the other hand, chiral condensates arise due to zero\nmodes in the Dirac operator within a fermion bag. Although in traditional\nfour-fermion models the two quantities seem to be related, we show that they\ncan be decoupled. While fermion bags become small at strong couplings, the\nability of zero modes of the Dirac operator within fermion bags to produce a\nchiral condensate, can be suppressed by the presence of additional zero modes\nfrom other fermions. Thus, fermions can become massive even without a chiral\ncondensate. This new mechanism of mass generation was discovered long ago in\nlattice field theory, but has remained unappreciated. Recent work suggests that\nit may be of interest even in continuum quantum field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 04:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-12"}

Since one of the\nmain targets of our analysis is to test the consistency of the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel with Planck 2013 data, we use the nuisance parameters associated with the\nbest-fit $\\Lambda$CDM angular power spectrum to remove foreground contributions\nfrom the data at multipoles $\\ell \\geq50$.

When additional planets\nare added to the system, the time-dependent perturbations from these additional\nsatellites can stir up gas in the gap, suppressing cavity opening. In this\nstudy, we perform two-dimensional numerical hydro calculations of gap opening\nfor single and multiple planets, showing the effect that additional planets\nhave on the gap depths.

We model the day-scale\nSEDs with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models,\ninvestigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observed\nbroadband SED variability can be associated to variations in the relativistic\nparticle population.\n  Flux variability was remarkable in the X-ray and VHE bands while it was minor\nor not significant in the other bands. The one-zone SSC model can describe\nreasonably well the SED of each day for the 13 consecutive days. This flaring\nactivity is also very well described by a two-zone SSC model, where one zone is\nresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which is\nspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variable\nemission occurring in X-rays and VHE gamma-rays.\n  Both the one-zone SSC and the two-zone SSC models can describe the daily SEDs\nvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesis\nthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particle\npopulation. This shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanism\nproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for the\nbroadband SED variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. The two-zone\nSSC model provides a better agreement to the observed SED at the narrow peaks\nof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although the\nreported one-zone SSC model could be further improved by the variation of the\nparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\\delta$, $B$ and $R$), in\naddition to the parameters related to the particle population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 08:59:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2015 01:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-16"}

A set of generalized transformations is\nderived in this paper which maps the NC problem to an equivalent commutative\nproblem. In this set up, we study the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the Landau\nlevels. For the Aharonov-Bohm effect, the phase-shift is found to contain\ncorrections due to phase-space noncommutativity and also depends on the scaling\nparameter appearing in the generalized transformations. The result agrees with\nthose in the literature upto first order in the noncommutative parameters when\nproper choice of the scaling parameter is taken.

The size and shape of the growing aggregates\ndetermine the efficiency of this early growth. It has been proposed that fluffy\nice aggregates can grow very efficiently, suffering less from the bouncing and\nradial drift barriers. While the collision velocity between icy aggregates of\nsimilar size is thought to stay below the fragmentation threshold, they may\nnonetheless lose mass from collisions with much smaller projectiles. We\ninvestigate the effect of these erosive collisions on the ability of porous ice\naggregates to cross the radial drift barrier. We develop a Monte Carlo code\nthat calculates the evolution of the growing aggregates, while resolving the\nentire mass distribution at all times. The aggregate's porosity is treated\nindependently of its mass, and is determined by collisions, gas compaction, and\neventually self-gravity compaction. For erosion threshold velocities of 20-40\nm/s, high-velocity collisions with small projectiles prevent the largest\naggregates from growing when they start to drift. In these cases, our local\nsimulations result in a steady-state distribution, with the majority of the\ndust mass in particles with Stokes numbers close to unity. Only for the highest\nerosion threshold considered (60 m/s), do porous aggregates manage to cross the\nradial drift barrier in the inner 10 AU of MMSN-like disks. Erosive collisions\nare more effective in limiting the growth than fragmentary collisions between\nsimilar-size particles. Conceivably, erosion limits the growth before the\nradial drift barrier, although the robustness of this statement depends on\n(uncertain) material properties of icy aggregates. If erosion inhibits\nplanetesimal formation through direct sticking, the sea of ${\\sim}10^9$ g,\nhighly porous particles appears well-suited for triggering streaming\ninstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 10:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

Such methods are typically computationally intensive. Recent work\nin the penalised optimisation setting has focussed on developing a\npruning-based approach which gives an improved computational cost that, under\ncertain conditions, is linear in the number of data points. Such an approach\nnaturally requires the specification of a penalty to avoid under/over-fitting.\nWork has been undertaken to identify the appropriate penalty choice for data\ngenerating processes with known distributional form, but in many applications\nthe model assumed for the data is not correct and these penalty choices are not\nalways appropriate. Consequently it is desirable to have an approach that\nenables us to compare segmentations for different choices of penalty. To this\nend we present a method to obtain optimal changepoint segmentations of data\nsequences for all penalty values across a continuous range. This permits an\nevaluation of the various segmentations to identify a suitably parsimonious\npenalty choice. The computational complexity of this approach can be linear in\nthe number of data points and linear in the difference between the number of\nchangepoints in the optimal segmentations for the smallest and largest penalty\nvalues.

All major components have been made at the\nWMI. The DR offers lots of space at the various stages of the apparatus for\nmicrowave components and cables. E. g., the usable space at the mixing chamber\nhas a height of more than 60 cm and a diameter of 30 cm (mixing chamber\nmounting plate). To cool cables and cold amplifiers, the DR is equipped with a\nseparate 4He-1K-loop which offers a cooling power of up to 100 mW near 1K. The\nrefrigeration power of the still is 18 mW at 0.9 K; the diameter of its\nmounting plate is 35 cm. The cryostat rests in an aluminum trestle on air\nsprings to attenuate building vibrations.

More precisely, the\nproblem is to determine the asymptotics of the expectation (and the variance)\nof $T_{m}(N)$, as well as its limit distribution, as the number $N$ of\ndifferent coupons becomes arbitrarily large. The classical case of the problem,\nnamely the case of equal coupon probabilities, is here extended to the general\ncase, where the probabilities of the selected coupons are unequal.\n  In the beginning of the article we give a brief review of the formulas for\nthe moments and the moment generating function of the random variable\n$T_{m}(N)$.

This is done in two steps: First we convert elements in\n$\\Lambda^{\\prime}$ to elements in $\\Sigma_n$. Then, using conjugation and the\nstabilization moves, we convert these elements to linear combinations of\nelements in $\\Lambda$ by managing gaps in the indices of the looping elements\nand by eliminating braiding tails in the words. Further, we define an ordering\nrelation in $\\Lambda^{\\prime}$ and $\\Lambda$ and prove that the sets are\ntotally ordered. Finally, using this ordering, we relate the sets\n$\\Lambda^{\\prime}$ and $\\Lambda$ via a block diagonal matrix, where each block\nis an infinite lower triangular matrix with invertible elements in the diagonal\nand we prove linear independence of the set $\\Lambda$. The infinite matrix is\nthen \"invertible\" and thus, the set $\\Lambda$ is a basis for $\\mathcal{S}({\\rm\nST})$.

Besides the robustness\nof the N=126 neutron shell closure, it is shown that the onset of static\ndeformations in those isotopic chains with increasing neutron number leads to\nan enhanced stability and further extends the corresponding two-neutron\ndriplines far beyond what could be expected from spherical calculations.\nIndependence of the mean field predictions with respect to the particular\nversion of the Gogny energy density functional employed is demonstrated by\ncomparing results based on the D1S and D1M parameter sets.

We describe a pulse tube precooled DR where a separate\nHe-4 circuit condenses the He-3 of the dilution loop. Whereas in our previous\nwork the dilution circuit and the He-4 circuit were separate, we show how the\ntwo circuits can be combined. Originally, the He-4 loop with a base temperature\nof ~ 1 K was installed to make an additional cooling power of up to 100 mW\navailable to cool cold amplifiers and electrical lines. In the new design, the\ndilution circuit is run through a heat exchanger in the vessel of the He-4\ncircuit so that the condensation of the He-3 stream of the DR is done by the\nHe-4 stage. A much reduced condensation time (factor of 2) of the He-3/He-4 gas\nmixture at the beginning of an experiment is achieved. A compressor is no\nlonger needed with the DR as the condensation pressure remains below\natmospheric pressure at all times; thus the risk of losing expensive He-3 gas\nis small. The performance of the DR has been improved compared to previous\nwork: The base temperature of the mixing chamber at a small He-3 flow rate is\nnow 4.1 mK; at the highest He-3 flow rate of 1.2 mmol/s this temperature\nincreases to 13 mK. Mixing chamber temperatures were measured with a cerium\nmagnesium nitrate (CMN) thermometer which was calibrated with a superconducting\nfixed point device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 14:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-12"}

Introducing the notion of exterior\nalgebraic(differential) system of a generalized Lie algebra(algebroid), the\ninvolutivity of an IAS(IDS) is characterized in a result of Cartan type.\nFinally, new directions by research in algebraic(differential) symplectic\nspaces theory are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 06:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2016 10:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-09"}

The corresponding infinitesimal quantities in this case must be\nreplaced by the \"minimal variations possible\" -- finite quantities dependent on\nthe existent energies. As a result, the initial low-energy theory (quantum\ntheory or general relativity) inevitably must be replaced by a minimal-length\ntheory that gives very close results but operates with absolutely other\nmathematical apparatus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 16:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-29"}
