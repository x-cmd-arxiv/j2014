However, there is\nconsiderable challenge in making reliable contacts to these atomically thin\nmaterials. Here we present a new strategy by using graphene as back electrodes\nto achieve Ohmic contact to MoS2. With a finite density of states, the Fermi\nlevel of graphene can be readily modified by gate potential to ensure a nearly\nperfect band alignment with MoS2.

However, it is also a time-consuming and challenging task that\nrequires advanced skills beyond the abilities of casual photographers. Using an\nautomated algorithm is an appealing alternative to manual work but such an\nalgorithm faces many hurdles. Many photographic styles rely on subtle\nadjustments that depend on the image content and even its semantics. Further,\nthese adjustments are often spatially varying. Because of these\ncharacteristics, existing automatic algorithms are still limited and cover only\na subset of these challenges. Recently, deep machine learning has shown unique\nabilities to address hard problems that resisted machine algorithms for long.\nThis motivated us to explore the use of deep learning in the context of photo\nediting.

As in the\nprograde coplanar case, Lindblad resonances play a key role in tidal\ntruncation. We analyze the tidal torque acting on a misaligned nearly circular\ndisk in a circular orbit binary system. We concentrate on the 2:1 inner\nLindblad resonance associated with the m=2 tidal forcing (for azimuthal\nwavenumber m) that plays a major role in the usual coplanar case. We determine\nthe inclination dependence of this torque, which is approximately cos^8(i/2)\nfor misalignment angle i. Compared to the prograde coplanar case (i=0), this\ntorque decreases by a factor of about 2 for i = pi/6 and by a factor of about\n20 for i=pi/2. The Lindblad torque decreases to zero for a tilt angle of pi\n(counter-rotation), consistent with previous investigations. The effects of\nhigher order resonances associated with m>2 tidal forcing may contribute\nsomewhat, but are much more limited than in the i=0 case. These results suggest\nthat misaligned disks in binary systems can be significantly extended compared\nto their coplanar counterparts. In cases where a disk is sufficiently inclined\nand viscous, it can overrun all Lindblad resonances and overflow the Roche lobe\nof the disk central object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2014 19:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We obtain a stringent statistical constraint on changes in\n$\\mu$ by comparing the redshifted 12.179 GHz and 60.531 GHz lines, $[\\Delta\nmu/\\mu] \\leq 1.1 \\times 10^{-7}$ ($2\\sigma$) over $0 < z \\leq 0.88582$, a\nfactor of $\\approx 2.5$ more sensitive than the best earlier results. However,\nthe higher signal-to-noise ratio (by a factor of $\\approx 2$) of the VLA\nspectrum in the 12.179 GHz transition also indicates that this line has a\ndifferent shape from that of the other three CH$_3$OH lines (at $> 4\\sigma$\nsignificance). The sensitivity of the above result, and that of all earlier\nCH$_3$OH studies, is thus likely to be limited by unknown systematic errors,\nprobably arising due to the frequency-dependent structure of PKS1830-211. A\nrobust result is obtained by combining the three lines at similar frequencies,\n48.372, 48.377 and 60.531 GHz, whose line profiles are found to be in good\nagreement. This yields the $2\\sigma$ constraint $[\\Delta \\mu/\\mu] \\lesssim 4\n\\times 10^{-7}$, the most stringent current constraint on changes in $\\mu$. We\nthus find no evidence for changes in the proton-electron mass ratio over a\nlookback time of $\\approx 7.5$ Gyrs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2014 21:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

WASP-85 b orbits its host star every 2.66 days,\nand has a mass of 1.25 M_Jup and a radius of 1.25 R_Jup. The host star is of G5\nspectral type, with magnitude V = 11.2, and lies 141 pc distant. The system has\na K-dwarf binary companion, WASP-85 B, at a separation of ~1.5\". The close\nproximity of this companion leads to contamination of our photometry,\ndecreasing the apparent transit depth that we account for during our analysis.\nAnalysis of the Ca II H+K lines shows strong emission that implies that both\nbinary components are strongly active. WASP-116 b is a warm, mildly inflated\nsuper-Saturn, with a mass of 0.59 M_Jup and a radius of 1.43 R_Jup. It was\ndiscovered orbiting a metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -0.28 dex), cool (T_eff = 5950 K) G0\ndwarf every 6.61 days. WASP-149 b is a typical hot Jupiter, orbiting a G6 dwarf\nwith a period of 1.33 days. The planet has a mass and radius of 1.05 M_Jup and\n1.29 R_Jup, respectively. The stellar host has an effective temperature of\nT_eff = 5750 K and has a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.16 dex. WASP photometry of\nthe system is contaminated by a nearby star; we therefore corrected the depth\nof the WASP transits using the measured dilution. WASP-149 lies inside the\n'Neptune desert' identified in the planetary mass-period plane by Mazeh,\nHolczer & Faigler (2016).\n  We model the modulation visible in the K2 lightcurve of WASP-85 using a\nsimple three-spot model consisting of two large spots on WASP-85 A, and one\nlarge spot on WASP-85 B, finding rotation periods of 13.1+/-0.1 days for\nWASP-85 A and 7.5+/-0.03 days for WASP-85 B. We estimate stellar inclinations\nof I_A = 66.8+/-0.7 degrees and I_B = 39.7+/-0.2 degrees, and constrain the\nobliquity of WASP-85 A b to be psi<27 degrees. We therefore conclude that\nWASP-85 A b is very likely to be aligned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2014 21:31:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 14:11:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 17:01:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 10 Feb 2019 00:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

In this paper, I analyze the MIT data with a thermodynamic theory of\nunitary thermodynamics based on ideas from critical phenomena. This theory was\nintroduced in the first paper of this sequence, and characterizes the scaled\nthermodynamics by the entropy per particle $z= S/N k_B$, and energy per\nparticle $Y(z)$, in units of the Fermi energy. $Y(z)$ is in two segments,\nseparated by a second-order phase transition at $z=z_c$: a \"normal\" segment for\n$z>z_c$, and a \"superfluid\" segment for $z<z_c$. For small $z$, the theory\nobeys a series $Y(z)=y_0+y_1 z^{\\alpha }+y_2 z^{2 \\alpha}+\\cdots,$ where\n$\\alpha$ is a constant exponent, and $y_i$ ($i\\ge 0$) are constant series\ncoefficients.

The proposed algorithm\nis implemented on two types of THP structures, the decentralized THP (dTHP)\nwith diagonal weighted filters at the receivers of the users, and the\ncentralized THP (cTHP) with diagonal weighted filter at the transmitter.\nSimulation results show that a much better bit error rate (BER) and sum-rate\nperformances can be achieved by the proposed iterative coordinate THP compared\nto the previous linear art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Dec 2014 00:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

Compared to state-of-the\nart related systems, the proposed metasurface system is more compact as it\nrequires only one dispersive structure, while maintaining the high frequency\nresolution that characterizes 2-D spatial-temporal mapping systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Dec 2014 06:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

The modified Bloch-Redfield\nmaster equation allows an unambiguous distinction between the regimes of\nquantum coherent vs. incoherent energy transfer under incoherent light\nillumination.

The\nstellar-like remnant is presumably embedded in a disc-like dusty envelope seen\nalmost face-on. The observed optical spectrum is assumed to result from\ninteractions of the central-star radiation with dust and gas in the disc and\noutflows initiated in 1994. We reduced and measured a high-resolution (R = ~40\n000) spectrum of V4332 Sgr obtained with VLT/UVES in April/May 2005. The\nspectrum comes from the ESO archives and is the best quality spectrum of the\nobject ever obtained. We identified and measured over 200 emission features\nbelonging to 11 elements and 6 molecules. The continuous, stellar-like\ncomponent can be classified as ~M3. The interstellar reddening was estimated to\nbe 0.35 < E(B-V) < 0.75. From radial velocities of interstellar absorption\nfeatures in the NaI D lines, we estimated a lower limit of ~5.5 kpc to the\ndistance of V4332 Sgr. The spectrum of V4332 Sgr considerably evolved between\n2005 and 2009. The object significantly faded in the optical, which resulted\nfrom cooling of the main remnant by 300-350 K, corresponding to its\nspectral-type change from M3 to M5-6. The object increased in luminosity by\n~50%, however, implying a significant expansion of its dimensions. Most of the\nemission features seen in 2005 significantly faded or even disappeared from the\nspectrum of V4332 Sgr in 2009. These resulted from fading of the optical\ncentral-star radiation and a decrease of the optical thickness of the\ncirumstellar matter. V4332 Sgr bears several resemblances to V1309 Sco, which\nerupted in 2008. This can indicate a similar nature of the eruptions of the two\nobjects.

The axions\nhave been shown to form miniclusters with masses $\\sim 10^{-12}M_{\\odot}$ and\nto become dominant component of dark matter. Some of the axion miniclusters\ncondense to form axion stars. We have recently shown a possible origin of fast\nradio bursts ( FRBs ) by assuming that the axion stars are main component of\nhalos: FRBs arise from the collisions between the axion stars and neutron\nstars. It is remarkable that the masses of the axion stars obtained by the\ncomparison of the theoretical and observational event rates are coincident with\nthe mass $\\sim 10^{-12}M_{\\odot}$. In this paper, we describe our model of FRBs\nin detail. We derive the approximate solutions of the axion stars with large\nradii and constraint their masses for the approximation to be valid. The FRBs\nare emitted by electrons in atmospheres of neutron stars. By calculating the\noptical depth of the atmospheres, we show that they are transparent for the\nradiations with the frequency given by the axion mass $m_a$ such as\n$m_a/2\\pi\\simeq 2.4$GHz$(m_a/10^{-5}\\rm eV)$. Although the radiations are\nlinearly polarized when they are emitted, they are shown to be circularly\npolarized after they pass magnetospheres of neutron stars. We also show that\nthe FRBs are not broadband and their frequencies have finite bandwidths owing\nto the thermal fluctuations of the electrons in the atmospheres of the neutron\nstars. The presence of the finite bandwidths is a distinctive feature of our\nmodel and can be tested observationally. Furthermore, we show that similar FRBs\nmay arise when the axion stars collide with magnetic white dwarfs $B\\sim\n10^9$G. The distinctive feature is that the durations of the bursts are of the\norder of $0.1$second.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Dec 2014 13:42:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 13:34:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2015 03:08:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 07:34:59 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 00:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

This is\nexacerbated by the fact that, in general, a given protein cannot be defined by\na fixed sequence of amino acids due to the existence of splice variants and\nisoforms of that protein. Therefore, the problem of protein inference could be\nconsidered as one of identifying sequences of amino acids with some limited\ntolerance. Two problems arise from this: a) due to these variations, the\napplicability of exact string matching methodologies could be questioned and b)\nthe difficulty of defining a reference sequence for a particular set of\nproteins that are functionally indistinguishable, but with some variation in\nfeatures. This paper presents a model-based inference approach that is\ndeveloped and validated to solve the inference problem. Our approach starts\nfrom an examination of the known set of splice variants and isoforms of a\ntarget protein to identify the Greatest Common Stable Substring (GCSS) of amino\nacids and the Substrings Subjects to Limited Variation (SSLV) and their\nrespective locations on the GCSS. Then we define and solve the Sub-string\nMatching Problem with Limited Tolerance (SMPLT). This approach is validated on\nidentified peptides in a labelled and clustered data set from UNIPROT.\nIdentification of Baylisascaris Procyonis infection was used as an application\ninstance that achieved up to 70 times speedup compared to a software only\nsystem. This workflow can be generalised to any inexact multiple pattern\nmatching application by replacing the patterns in a clustered and distributed\nenvironment which permits a distance between member strings to account for\npermitted deviations such as substitutions, insertions and deletions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Dec 2014 11:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-31"}

Calculations\nmodel the interaction of a fully-resolved premixed flame with a highly\nsubsonic, statistically steady, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. We consider\na wide range of turbulent intensities and system sizes, corresponding to the\nDamk\\\"ohler numbers Da = 0.1-6.0. These calculations show that turbulent flames\nin the regimes considered are intrinsically unstable. In particular, we find\nthree effects. 1) Turbulent flame speed develops pulsations with the observed\npeak-to-peak amplitude > 10 and a characteristic time scale close to a\nlarge-scale eddy turnover time. Such variability is caused by the interplay\nbetween turbulence, which continuously creates the flame surface, and highly\nintermittent flame collisions, which consume the flame surface. 2) Unstable\nburning results in the periodic pressure build-up and the formation of pressure\nwaves or shocks, when the flame speed approaches or exceeds the speed of a\nChapman-Jouguet deflagration. 3) Coupling of pressure gradients formed during\npulsations with density gradients across the flame leads to the anisotropic\namplification of turbulence inside the flame volume and flame acceleration.\nSuch process, which is driven by the baroclinic term in the vorticity transport\nequation, is a reacting-flow analog of the mechanism underlying the\nRichtmyer-Meshkov instability. With the increase in turbulent intensity, the\nlimit-cycle instability discussed here transitions to the regime described in\nour previous work, in which the growth of the flame speed becomes unbounded and\nproduces a detonation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2014 21:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-16"}

Standard technology comparisons using\nthe global warming potential (GWP) emissions equivalency metric do not reveal\nthese dynamic impacts, and may not provide the information needed to assess\ntechnologies and emissions mitigation opportunities in the context of broader\nclimate policy goals. Here we formulate a portfolio optimization model that\nincorporates changes in technology impacts as a radiative forcing (RF)\nstabilization target is approached. An optimal portfolio, maximizing allowed\nenergy consumption while meeting the RF target, is obtained by year-wise\nminimization of the marginal RF impact in an intended stabilization year. The\noptimal portfolio calls for using certain higher methane-emitting technologies\nprior to an optimal switching year, followed by methane-light technologies as\nthe stabilization year approaches. The model is applied to transportation\ntechnology pairs and shows that, by accounting for the differing decay behavior\nof gases, optimal switching portfolios allow energy consumption gains of up to\n50% compared to relying on the higher methane-emitting technology alone. The\nresults allow for estimates of target timelines for mitigating methane\nemissions from energy technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Dec 2014 10:32:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 21:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-06"}
