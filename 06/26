We propose a game theoretic framework that\naddresses these questions and show that the lognormal distribution is the\nfairest inequality of pay in an organization comprising of homogenous agents,\nachieved at equilibrium, under ideal free market conditions. We also show that\nfor a population of two different classes of agents, the final distribution is\na combination of two different lognormal distributions where one of them,\ncorresponding to the top 3-5% of the population, can be misidentified as a\nPareto distribution. Our theory also shows the deep and direct connection\nbetween potential game theory and statistical mechanics through entropy, which\nis a measure of fairness in a distribution.

The emissivity profile of the accretion disc, illuminated by the\nX-ray emitting corona, along with previous measurements of reverberation time\nlags are used to infer the spatial extent of the X-ray source. By fitting a\ntwice-broken power law emissivity profile to the relativistically-broadened\niron K fluorescence line, it is inferred that the X-ray emitting corona expands\nradially, over the plane of the accretion disc, by 25 to 30 per cent as the\nluminosity increases, contracting again as the luminosity decreases, while\nincreases in the measured reverberation lag as the luminosity increases would\nrequire also variation in the vertical extent of the source above the disc.

The generalized theory (C-SALT) is able to\ntreat atomic and molecular gain media with diffusion and multiple lasing\ntransitions, and semiconductor gain media in the free carrier approximation\nincluding fully the effect of Pauli blocking. The key assumption of the theory\nis stationarity of the level populations, which leads to coupled\nself-consistent equations for the populations and the lasing modes that fully\ninclude the effects of openness and non-linear spatial hole-burning. These\nequations can be solved efficiently for the steady-state lasing properties by a\nsimilar iteration procedure as in SALT, where a static gain medium with a\nsingle transition is assumed. The theory is tested by comparison to much less\nefficient Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) methods and excellent agreement\nis found.

The\nsample consists of high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra covering both\ndwarfs and giants from [Fe/H]=-0.63 down to -3.16. Thus we provide information\non the behaviour of Mo I and Ru I at higher and lower metallicity than is\ncurrently known. We find a wide spread in the Mo and Ru abundances, which is\ntypical of heavy elements. This indicates that several formation processes, in\naddition to high entropy winds, can be responsible for the formation of Mo and\nRu. The formation processes are traced by comparing Mo and Ru to elements (Sr,\nZr, Pd, Ag, Ba, and Eu) with known formation processes. We find contributions\nfrom different formation channels, namely p-, slow (s-), and rapid (r-)\nneutron-capture processes. Molybdenum is a highly convolved element that\nreceives contributions from several processes, whereas Ru is mainly formed by\nthe weak r-process as is silver. We also compare our absolute elemental stellar\nabundances to relative isotopic abundances of presolar grains extracted from\nmeteorites. Their isotopic abundances can be directly linked to the formation\nprocess (e.g. r-only isotopes) providing a unique comparison between\nobservationally derived abundances and the nuclear formation process. The\ncomparison to abundances in presolar grains shows that the r-/s-process ratios\nfrom the presolar grains match the total elemental chemical composition derived\nfrom metal-poor halo stars with [Fe/H]~ -1.5 to -1.1 dex.

These light curves are characterised by a long-lived\n($\\gtrsim10^2$ seconds) emission, whose luminosity decays in time as a\npower-law. While the decay rate is similar for all GRBs (i.e. $L_{LAT}\\propto\nt^{-1.2}$), the normalisation spans about two orders of magnitude in\nluminosity. However, after re-normalising the luminosities to the prompt\nenergetics $E_{iso}$ the light curves overlap. We consider the scenario in\nwhich the temporally extended LAT emission is dominated by synchrotron\nradiation from electrons accelerated at the forward external shock. According\nto this model, at high-energies (i.e. above the typical synchrotron\nfrequencies) a small dispersion of the $E_{iso}$-normalised light curves is\nexpected. The fact that the LAT temporally extended emission follows this\nbehaviour reinforces its interpretation in terms of afterglow radiation from\nexternal shocks. Assuming this scenario, we argue that the parameters\n$\\epsilon_e$ and $\\eta_\\gamma$ (i.e., the fraction of shock-dissipated energy\ngained by the electrons, and the efficiency of the mechanism producing the\nprompt radiation, respectively) must be narrowly distributed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2014 20:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Our analysis suggests that directional EW\nboosting can occur, and that this is mostly driven by reduced escape fractions\nof UV photons (which gives rise to UV-continuum `shadows'), and less due to an\nenhanced Ly$\\alpha$ escape fraction (or beaming), in certain directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2014 20:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 16:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-01"}

In response, we describe BiMAT, an object-oriented MATLAB\npackage for the study of the structure of bipartite ecological networks. BiMAT\ncan analyze the structure of networks, including features such as modularity\nand nestedness, using a selection of widely-adopted algorithms. BiMAT also\nincludes a variety of null models for evaluating the statistical significance\nof network properties. BiMAT is capable of performing multi-scale analysis of\nstructure - a potential (and under-examined) feature of many biological\nnetworks. Finally, BiMAT relies on the graphics capabilities of MATLAB to\nenable the visualization of the statistical structure of bipartite networks in\neither matrix or graph layout representations. BiMAT is available as an\nopen-source package at http://ecotheory.biology.gatech.edu/cflores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2014 23:06:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 01:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-18"}

When our models attempt to fit both the NIFS kinematics and\nadditional low spatial resolution kinematics, our results depend sensitively on\nhow chi-squared is computed--probably a consequence of complex bar kinematics\nthat manifest immediately outside the nuclear region. The most robust results\nare obtained when only the high spatial resolution kinematic constraints in the\nnuclear region are included in the fit. Our best estimates for the BH mass and\nH-band mass-to-light ratio are Mbh~(3.76+/-1.15)E7 Msun (1-sigma error) and\nM/L(H-band)~0.34+/-0.03 Msun/Lsun (3-sigma error), respectively (the quoted\nerrors reflect the model uncertainties).

Using these models\nand field strengths, we derive an average isochronal age between 15 and 28 Myr\nand we confirm a clear Lithium Depletion Boundary from which an age of\n26$\\pm$3~Myr is derived, consistent with previous age estimates based on this\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 02:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Though the first three of the four basic laws are\napparent, the forth basic law has been uncertain. This paper shows first that\nthis forth basic law can be deduced from the law which is called in this paper\nthe conservation law of circulation.\n  It is then demonstrated that, within the framework of the equations, an\ninternal bore is represented by a shock satisfying the shock conditions that\nfollow from the four basic laws. A gravity current can also be treated within\nthe framework of the equations if the front conditions, i.e. the boundary\nconditions to be imposed at the front of the current, are known. Basically, the\nfront conditions for a gravity current also follow from the four basic laws.\nWhen the gravity current is advancing along a no-slip boundary, however, it is\nnecessary to take into account the influence of the thin boundary layer formed\non the boundary; this paper describes how this influence can be evaluated.\n  It is verified that the theory can satisfactorily explain the behaviour of\ninternal bores advancing into two stationary layers of fluid. The theory also\nprovides a formula for the rate of advance of a gravity current along a no-slip\nlower boundary; this formula proves to be consistent with some empirical\nformulae. In addition, some well-known theoretical formulae on gravity currents\nturn out to be obtainable on the basis of the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 03:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-27"}

The quadratic measurement becomes\nlinear in terms of the rank-one matrix $X = x x^*$. Phase retrieval is then a\nrank-one minimization problem subject to linear constraint for which a convex\nrelaxation based on trace-norm minimization (PhaseLift) has been extensively\nstudied recently. At $m=O(n)$, PhaseLift recovers with high probability the\nrank-one solution.

A localized potential can interact\nwith a magnetic field in an unexpected way in graphene. It can lead to\nformation of anomalous boundstates that have a sharp peak with a width $R$ in\nthe probability density inside the potential and a broad peak of size magnetic\nlength $\\ell$ outside the potential. We investigate optical matrix elements of\nanomalous states, and find that they are unusually small and depend sensitively\non magnetic field. The effect of many-body interactions on their optical\nconductivity is investigated using a self-consistent time-dependent\nHartree-Fock approach (TDHFA). For a completely filled Landau level we find\nthat an excited electron-hole pair, originating from the optical transition\nbetween two anomalous impurity states, is nearly uncorrelated with other\nelectron-hole pairs, although it displays a substantial exchange self-energy\neffects. This absence of correlation is a consequence of a small vertex\ncorrection in comparison to the difference between renormalized transition\nenergies computed within the one electron-hole pair approximation. However, an\nexcited electron-hole pair originating from the optical transition between a\nnormal and an anomalous impurity states can be substantially correlated with\nother electron-hole states with a significant optical strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 04:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-25"}

The thesis of this paper is\nthat approximately optimal mechanisms allow us to reason about fundamental\nquestions that seem out of reach of the traditional theory.\n  This survey has three main parts. The first part describes the approximately\noptimal mechanism design paradigm --- how it works, and what we aim to learn by\napplying it. The second and third parts of the survey cover two case studies,\nwhere we instantiate the general design paradigm to investigate two basic\nquestions.

The second example considers\nwelfare maximization with multiple items. Our goal here is similar in spirit:\nwhen is complexity --- in the form of high-dimensional bid spaces --- an\nessential feature of every auction that guarantees reasonable welfare? Are\nthere interesting cases where low-dimensional bid spaces suffice?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 05:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-23"}

In this work, the well-tested\njet quenching Monte-Carlo (MC) framework YaJEM is utilized to compute the\nrapidity dependence of R_AA for three test cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 06:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-27"}

It is shown how the potential of the cavity\nchanges by tuning the system to a regime where conductance quantization in the\nconstrictions formed by the tip and the top gates occurs. This conductance\nquantization leads to a unprecedented rich fringe pattern over the entire\nstructure. Finally, the effect of electrostatic screening of the metallic top\ngates is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 09:41:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 17:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-11"}

This constitutes a necessary preliminary step towards the\ncorrect quantization in non-linear cases, where the success of Canonical\nQuantization is not guaranteed in general. To achieve this task \"point\nsymmetries\" of the Lagrangian are generally not enough, and the notion of\ncontact transformations is in order: the solution manifold can not be in\ngeneral parametrized by means of Noether invariants associated with basic point\nsymmetries. The use of the contact structure given by the Poincar\\'e-Cartan\nform permits the definition of the symplectic form on the solution manifold,\nthrough some sort of Hamilton-Jacobi transformation. It also provides the\nrequired basic symmetries, realized as Hamiltonian vector fields associated\nwith global functions on the solution manifold (thus constituting an inverse of\nthe Noether Theorem), lifted back to the evolution space through the inverse of\nthis Hamilton-Jacobi mapping. In this framework, solutions and symmetries, as a\nwhole, are somehow identified and this correspondence is also kept at a\nperturbative level. We present non-trivial examples of this interplay between\nsymmetries and solutions pointing out the usefulness of this mechanism in\napproaching the corresponding quantization. In particular, we achieve the\nproper generalization of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra for the non-linear\nparticle sigma model in $S^3$ within this framework, and notice that a subset\nof the classical symmetries corresponding with this quantizing algebra (those\ngeneralizing boosts) are necessarily of non-point character.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 10:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2015 10:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2015 17:09:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

In this\ncontext, fundamental practical limitations, namely the rigid framing structure\nof satellite communication standards and the on-board per-antenna power\nconstraints, are herein considered. Therefore, the concept of optimal frame\nbased precoding under per-antenna constraints, is discussed. This consists in\nprecoding the transmit signals without changing the underlying framing\nstructure of the communication standard. In the present work, the connection of\nthe frame based precoding problem with the generic signal processing problem of\nconveying independent sets of common data to distinct groups of users is\nestablished.

By using the code, the beam\nloading effect on the rf system of the CSNS/RCS has been investigated. Some\nsimulation results have been obtained and conclusions have been drawn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 13:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Using systematic uncertainties of red the MAGIC and\nFermi-LAT measurements we determine the position of the Inverse Compton peak to\nbe at (53 $\\pm$ 3stat + 31syst -13syst) GeV, which is the most precise\nestimation up to date and is dominated by the systematic effects. There is no\nhint of the integral flux variability on daily scales at energies above 300 GeV\nwhen systematic uncertainties are included in the flux measurement. We consider\nthree state- of-the-art theoretical models to describe the overall spectral\nenergy distribution of the Crab Nebula. The constant B-field model cannot\nsatisfactorily reproduce the VHE spectral measurements presented in this work,\nhaving particular difficulty reproducing the broadness of the observed IC peak.\nMost probably this implies that the assumption of the homogeneity of the\nmagnetic field inside the nebula is incorrect. On the other hand, the\ntime-dependent 1D spectral model provides a good fit of the new VHE results\nwhen considering a 80 {\\mu}G magnetic field. However, it fails to match the\ndata when including the morphology of the nebula at lower wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 14:03:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Feb 2015 10:01:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2015 10:25:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 10:19:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 10:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

A natural approach to this problem\nis to look for efficient gluing computation approaches, with independent\ncomponents developed by researchers in numerical analysis, dynamical systems,\nscientific computing and mathematical modelling. In this paper, we shall study\nseveral elliptic PDEs (Lane-Emden-Fowler, Lane-Emden-Fowler with microscopic\nforce, Caginalp) via the numerical continuation software pde2path and develop a\ngluing component to determine a set of starting solutions for the continuation\nby exploting the variational structures of the PDEs. In particular, we solve\nthe initialization problem of numerical continuation for PDEs via a minimax\nalgorithm to find multiple unstable solution. Furthermore, for the Caginalp\nsystem, we illustrate the efficient gluing link of pde2path to the underlying\nmesh generation and the FEM MatLab pdetoolbox. Even though the approach works\nefficiently due to the high-level programming language and without developing\nany new algorithms, we still obtain interesting bifurcation diagrams and\ndirectly applicable conclusions about the three elliptic PDEs we study, in\nparticular with respect to symmetry-breaking. In particular, we show for a\nmodified Lane-Emden-Fowler equation with an asymmetric microscopic force, how a\nfully connected bifurcation diagram splits up into C-shaped isolas on which\nlocalized pattern deformation appears towards two different regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 14:37:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 17:48:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2014 14:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

The collective dynamics of this systems is studied by agent-based\nsimulations and kinetic mean field theory. We demonstrate that the reduction of\nthe restriction angle leads to a critical noise amplitude decreasing\nmonotonically with that angle, turning into a power law with exponent 3/2 for\nsmall angles. Moreover, for small system sizes we show that upon decreasing the\nrestriction angle, the kind of the transition to polar collective motion\nchanges from continuous to discontinuous.

The method is built with high-performance\ncomputing (HPC) implementation in mind that implies a high level of parallelism\nand greatly reduced communication requirements compared to the traditional\nhigh-order finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods. The approach is\ninherently multiscale, with a reference fine grid model being split into\nsubdomains. For each subdomain the coarse scale reduced order models (ROMs) are\nprecomputed off-line in a parallel manner. The ROMs approximate the\nNeumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) maps with high (spectral) accuracy and are used to\ncouple the adjacent subdomains on the shared boundaries. The on-line part of\nthe method is an explicit time stepping with the coupled ROMs. To lower the\non-line computation cost the reduced order spatial operator is sparsified by\ntransforming to a matrix Stieltjes continued fraction (S-fraction) form. The\non-line communication costs are also reduced due to the ROM NtD map\napproximation properties. Another source of performance improvement is the time\nstep length. Properly chosen ROMs substantially improve the\nCourant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition.

Recently, Chen\nand Singer presented a method for deciding whether a rational function is\nsummable. To implement their method in the sense of algorithms, we need to\nsolve two problems. The first is to determine the shift equivalence of two\nbivariate polynomials. We solve this problem by presenting an algorithm for\ncomputing the dispersion sets of any two bivariate polynomials. The second is\nto solve a univariate difference equation in an algebraically closed field. By\nconsidering the irreducible factorization of the denominator of $f(x,y)$ in a\ngeneral field, we present a new criterion which requires only finding a\nrational solution of a bivariate difference equation. This goal can be achieved\nby deriving a universal denominator of the rational solutions and a degree\nbound on the numerator. Combining these two algorithms, we can decide the\nsummability of a bivariate rational function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 02:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-12"}

We show, for finite k\\geq 3, that S_cNr_nCA_{n+k}\nis not elementary, hence the class of CA_n's having complete n+3-smooth\nrepresentations is not elementary.
