The purpose of\nthe paper is to elucidate the morphology of the various emission components in\nthe strong star-formation region lying inside the solar radius and to clarify\nthe relationship between the various components. The region of the Galactic\nplane covered is l=300-0-60deg where star-formation is highest and the emission\nis strong enough to make meaningful component separation. The latitude widths\nin this longitude range lie between 1deg and 2deg, which correspond to FWHM\nz-widths of 100-200pc at a typical distance of 6kpc. The four emission\ncomponents studied here are synchrotron, free-free, anomalous microwave\nemission (AME), and thermal (vibrational) dust emission. These components are\nidentified by constructing spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at positions\nalong the Galactic plane using the wide frequency coverage of Planck\n(28.4-857GHz) in combination with low-frequency radio data at 0.408-2.3GHz plus\nWMAP data at 23-94GHz, along with far-infrared (FIR) data from DIRBE and IRAS.\nThe free-free component is determined from radio recombination line (RRL) data.\nAME is found to be comparable in brightness to the free-free emission on the\nGalactic plane in the frequency range 20-40GHz with a width in latitude similar\nto that of the thermal dust; it comprises 45+/-1% of the total 28.4GHz emission\nin the longitude range l=300-0-60deg. The free-free component is the narrowest,\nreflecting the fact that it is produced by current star-formation as traced by\nthe narrow distribution of OB stars. It is the dominant emission on the plane\nbetween 60 and 100GHz. RRLs from this ionized gas are used to assess its\ndistance, leading to a free-free z-width of FWHM ~100pc...(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 16:05:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 14:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-22"}

We provide a\nfoundation for such extensions, and carry out a concrete formulation of the\ngravitational self-force in two specific cases. In the first we consider a\nparticle of mass $m$ and scalar charge $q$ moving in a background spacetime\nthat contains a background scalar field. In the second we consider a particle\nof mass $m$ and electric charge $e$ moving in an electrovac spacetime. The\nself-force incorporates all couplings between the gravitational perturbations\nand those of the scalar or electromagnetic fields. It is expressed as a sum of\nlocal terms involving tensors defined in the background spacetime and evaluated\nat the current position of the particle, as well as tail integrals that depend\non the past history of the particle. Because such an expression is rarely a\nuseful starting point for an explicit evaluation of the self-force, we also\nprovide covariant expressions for the singular potentials, expressed as local\nexpansions near the world line; these can be involved in the construction of\neffective extended sources for the regular potentials, or in the computation of\nregularization parameters when the self-force is computed as a sum over\nspherical-harmonic modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 17:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The formal expression $f^{ret}_\\alpha$ for the self-force on a\nparticle, written in terms of the retarded perturbed fields, is divergent, and\na renormalization is needed to find the particle's acceleration at linear order\nin its mass $m$ and charge $e$. We assume that, as in previous work in a Lorenz\ngauge, the renormalization for accelerated motion comprises an angle average\nand mass renormalization. Using the short distance expansion of the perturbed\nelectromagnetic and gravitational fields, we show that the renormalization is\nequivalent to that obtained from a mode sum regularization in which one\nsubtracts from the expression for the self-force in terms of the retarded\nfields a singular part field comprising only the leading and subleading terms\nin the mode sum. The most striking part of our result, arising from a\nremarkable cancellation, is that the renormalization involves no mixing of\nelectromagnetic and gravitational fields. In particular, the renormalized mass\nis obtained by subtracting (1) the purely electromagnetic contribution from a\npoint charge moving along an accelerated trajectory and (2) the purely\ngravitational contribution from a point mass moving along the same trajectory.\nIn a mode-sum regularization, the same cancellation implies that the required\nregularization parameters are sums of their purely electromagnetic and\ngravitational values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 17:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

Chan, Church, and Grochow showed that if G is a planar ribbon\ngraph, it has a canonical rotor-routing action associated to it, i.e., the\nrotor-routing action is actually independent of the choice of root vertex.\n  It is well-known that the spanning trees of a planar graph G are in canonical\nbijection with those of its planar dual G*, and furthermore that the sandpile\ngroups of G and G* are isomorphic. Thus, one can ask: are the two rotor-routing\nactions, of the sandpile group of G on its spanning trees, and of the sandpile\ngroup of G* on its spanning trees, compatible under plane duality? In this\npaper, we give an affirmative answer to this question, which had been\nconjectured by Baker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 18:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-20"}

The kinematics of\nthe ionized gas and the stars are dominated by rotation, with large observed\nvelocity amplitudes and centrally peaked velocity dispersion maps. The stars\nlag behind the warm gas and represent a dynamically hotter system, as indicated\nby the observed dynamical ratios. Thanks to these IFS data we have disentangled\nthe contribution of the stars and the ISM to the NaD feature, finding that it\nis dominated by the absorption of neutral gas clouds in the ISM. The neutral\ngas 2D kinematics shows a complex structure dominated by two components.

In particular, we\nshow that the planar integrand for N=4 SYM satisfies the tree-level soft\ntheorem to all orders in perturbation theory and provide strong evidence to\nthis effect for integrands in N<4 SYM. We consider soft theorems for\nnon-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories and gravity, and show the validity of\nintegrand soft theorem, while loop corrections to the integrated soft theorems\nare intimately tied to the presence of conformal anomalies. We then address the\nquestion of universality of the soft theorems for various theories. In\neffective field theories with F^3 and R^3 interactions, the soft theorems are\nnot modified. However for gravity theories with R^2 phi interactions, the\nsub-sub-leading order soft graviton theorem, which is beyond what is implied by\nthe extended BMS symmetry, requires modifications at tree level for\nnon-supersymmetric theories, and at loop level for N<5 supergravity due to\nanomalies. Finally, for superstring amplitudes at finite alpha', via explicit\ncalculation for lower-point examples as well as world-sheet OPE analysis for\narbitrary multiplicity, we show that the superstring amplitudes satisfy the\nsame soft theorem as its field-theory counterpart.

To dynamically model their interactions with\nmassive perturbers a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted, using an impulsive\napproximation method and assuming a galactic halo constituted by massive\nparticles of a characteristic mass. The results of such simulations are\ncompared with several subsamples of our improved catalog of candidate halo wide\nbinaries. In accordance with Quinn et al.

However, our larger sample, together\nwith the fact that we can obtain galactic orbits for 150 of our systems, allows\na more reliable estimate of the maximum MACHO mass than that obtained\npreviously. If we employ the entire sample of 211 candidate halo stars we\nobtain an upper limit of $112 M_\\sun$. However, using the 150 binaries in our\ncatalog with computed galactic orbits we are able to refine our fitting\ncriteria. Thus, for the 100 most halo-like binaries we obtain a maximum MACHO\nmass of $21-68 M_\\sun$. Furthermore, we can estimate the dynamical effects of\nthe galactic disk using binary samples that spend progressively shorter times\nwithin the disk. By extrapolating the limits obtained for our most reliable\n-albeit smallest- sample we find that as the time spent within the disk tends\nto zero the upper bound of the MACHO mass tends to less than $5 M_\\sun$.

In\nF-theory, gauge symmetries with abelian gauge factors are modeled by singular\nelliptic fibrations with additional rational sections, i.e. a non-trivial\nMordell-Weil rank. To determine the full scope of possible low energy theories\nwith abelian gauge factors, which allow for an F-theory realization, it is\ncentral to obtain a comprehensive list of all singular elliptic fibrations with\nextra sections. We answer this question for the case of one abelian factor by\napplying Tate's algorithm to the elliptic fiber realized as a quartic in the\nweighted projective space P^{(1,1,2)}, which guarantees, in addition to the\nzero section, the existence of an additional rational section.

This level of\ndescription offers a rather flexible position for the interpretation of quantum\nmechanics. Here we analyse an ideal measurement as a process of interaction\nbetween the tested system S and an apparatus A, so as to derive the properties\npostulated in textbooks. We thus consider within standard quantum mechanics the\nmeasurement of a quantum spin component $\\hat s_z$ by an apparatus A, being a\nmagnet coupled to a bath. We first consider the evolution of the density\noperator of S+A describing a large set of runs of the measurement process. The\napproach describes the disappearance of the off-diagonal terms (\"truncation\")\nof the density matrix as a physical effect due to A, while the registration of\nthe outcome has classical features due to the large size of the pointer\nvariable, the magnetisation. A quantum ambiguity implies that the density\nmatrix at the final time can be decomposed on many bases, not only the one of\nthe measurement. This quantum oddity prevents to connect individual outcomes to\nmeasurements, a difficulty known as the \"measurement problem\". It is shown that\nit is circumvented by the apparatus as well, since the evolution in a small\ntime interval erases all decompositions, except the one on the measurement\nbasis. Once one can derive the outcome of individual events from quantum\ntheory, the so-called \"collapse of the wave function\" or the \"reduction of the\nstate\" appears as the result of a selection of runs among the original large\nset. Hence nothing more than standard quantum mechanics is needed to explain\nfeatures of measurements. The employed statistical formulation is advocated for\nthe teaching of quantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 17:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-28"}

Rather, an\nadditional mechanism is required to pre-accelerate the electrons from thermal\nto supra-thermal energies, so they can then participate in the Fermi process.\nIn this work, we use two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell plasma\nsimulations to study electron acceleration in low Mach number shocks. We focus\non the particle energy spectra and the acceleration mechanism in a reference\nrun with M=3 and a quasi-perpendicular pre-shock magnetic field.

The accelerated electrons are then reflected back upstream, where\ntheir interaction with the incoming flow generates magnetic waves. In turn, the\nwaves scatter the electrons propagating upstream back toward the shock, for\nfurther energization via shock drift acceleration. In summary, the\nself-generated waves allow for repeated cycles of shock drift acceleration,\nsimilarly to a sustained Fermi-like process.

Here we demonstrate that it is a simple\nconsequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by\napproximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a\nrandom walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at\nthe previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of\nstar-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for\nstochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are\ncorrelated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an\nexpectation that <SSFR> should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have\na relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. The derived SFMS and\nits evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy to\nconstrain cosmological parameters. The framework reproduces several important\nobservables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby\ndwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation.\nThe evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways\nto generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as\nmergers. The predicted dispersion in SSFR has consequences for the\nclassification of quiescent galaxies, as such galaxies have heterogeneous\nformation histories, and many may only be temporarily diminished in their\nstar-formation activity. The implied dispersion in SFHs, and the SFMS's\ninsensitivity to timescales of stochasticity, thus substantially limits the\nability to connect massive galaxies to their progenitors over long cosmic\nbaselines.

The frustration of colloids and vortices differs essentially from\nspin ice. However, their effective energetics is made identical by the\ncontribution of an emergent field associated to the topological charge, thus\nleading to a (quasi) ice manifold for lattices of even (odd) coordination. The\nequivalence extends to the local low-energy dynamics of the ice manifold, where\nthe effect of geometric hard constraints can be subsumed into the spatial\nmodulation of the emergent field, which mediates an entropic interaction\nbetween topological charges. There, as in spin ice materials, genuine ice\nmanifolds enter a Coulomb phase, whereas quasi-ice manifolds posses a well\ndefined screening length, provided by a plasma of embedded topological charges.\nThe equivalence between the two systems breaks down in lattices of mixed\ncoordination because of topological charge transfer between sub-latices.

Bruhat interval polytopes were studied recently by\nKodama and the second author, in the context of the Toda lattice and the moment\nmap on the flag variety.\n  In this paper we study combinatorial aspects of Bruhat interval polytopes.\nFor example, we give an inequality description and a dimension formula for\nBruhat interval polytopes, and prove that every face of a Bruhat interval\npolytope is a Bruhat interval polytope. A key tool in the proof of the latter\nstatement is a generalization of the well-known lifting property for Coxeter\ngroups. Motivated by the relationship between the lifting property and\nR-polynomials, we also give a generalization of the standard recurrence for\nR-polynomials. Finally, we define a more general class of polytopes called\nBruhat interval polytopes for G/P, which are moment map images of (closures of)\ntotally positive cells in the non-negative part of G/P, and are a special class\nof Coxeter matroid polytopes. Using tools from total positivity and the\nGelfand-Serganova stratification, we show that the face of any Bruhat interval\npolytope for G/P is again a Bruhat interval polytope for G/P.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 20:11:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 19:17:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 19:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

We note that this is not the case for dusty shells and\nclouds. Instead, if the shell or cloud is initially optically-thick to the UV\nemission from the source of luminosity L, then there is a significant boost in\nV that reflects the integral of the momentum absorbed as it is accelerated. For\nshells reaching a generalized Eddington limit, we show that V ~ (4R_UV L/M_sh\nc)^1/2, in both point-mass and isothermal-sphere potentials, where R_UV is the\nradius where the shell becomes optically-thin to UV photons, and M_sh is the\nmass of the shell. The asymptotic velocity significantly exceeds v_esc for\ntypical parameters, and can explain the ~1000-2000km/s outflows observed from\nrapidly star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei if the surrounding\nhalo has low gas density. Similarly fast outflows from massive stars can be\naccelerated on few - 10^3 yr timescales.

We focus on\na hot, magnetized jet that is emitted by a black hole and interacts with a\nconfining medium. Strongly relativistic expansion of the magnetic field, as\nlimited by a corrugation instability, may commence only after it forms a thin\nshell. Then the observed $T_{90}$ burst duration is dominated by the curvature\ndelay, and null periods arise from angular inhomogeneities, not the duty cycle\nof the engine. We associate the $O(1)$ s timescale observed in the pulse width\ndistribution of long GRBs with the collapse of the central 2.5-3$M_\\odot$ of a\nmassive stellar core. A fraction of the baryons are shown to be embedded in the\nmagnetized outflow by the hyper-Eddington radiation flux; they strongly disturb\nthe magnetic field after the compactness drops below $\\sim 4\\times\n10^3(Y_e/0.5)^{-1}$.

Key to the\nstrategy is that each relay station merely maintains two parameters that\ncontains the trend of its previous energy consumption and then predicts its\nfuture quantity of energy, which is defined as the relay station potential\nenergy capacity.

Due to the interplay between inter-orbital Coulomb interaction and\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) in this compound, the SODW is shown to arise from\nFermi surface nesting instability between two spin-orbit split bands. An\neffective low-energy Hamiltonian including single-particle SOC and two-particle\nSODW is derived, while numerical results are calculated by using\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) based band structure input. Computed gapped\nquasiparticle spectrum, entropy loss and spin-excitation spectrum are in\ndetailed agreement with experiments. Interestingly, despite the fact that SODW\ngoverns dynamical spin-excitations, the static magnetic moment is calculated to\nbe zero, owing to the time-reversal invariance imposed by SOC. As a\nconsequence, SODW can be destroyed by finite magnetic field even at zero\ntemperature. Our estimation of the location of the quantum critical point is\nclose to the experimental value of Bc ~ 35 T. Finally, we extend the idea of\nSODW to other SOC systems including iridium oxides (iridates) and\ntwo-dimensional electronic systems such as BiAg2 surface and LaAlO3/SrTiO3\ninterface. We show hints of quasiparticle gapping, reduction of preexisting\nmagnetic moment, large magneto-resistance etc. in these systems which can be\nexplained consistently within the SODW theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 03:50:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 15:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-24"}

To understand this\ncomplexity, the magnetic skeleton of the coronal field can be calculated. The\nskeleton highlights the separatrix surfaces that divide the field into\ntopologically distinct regions, allowing open-field regions on the solar\nsurface to be located. Furthermore, separatrix surfaces and their intersections\n(separators) are important likely energy release sites. This paper\ninvestigates, throughout the solar cycle, the nature of coronal magnetic-field\ntopologies that arise under the potential-field source-surface approximation.\nIn particular, we characterise the typical global fields at solar maximum and\nminimum. Global magnetic fields are extrapolated from observed Kitt Peak and\nSOLIS synoptic magnetograms, from Carrington rotations 1645 to 2144, using the\npotential-field source-surface model. Hence, variations in the coronal skeleton\nare studied over three solar cycles. Key building blocks which make up magnetic\nfields are identified and classified according to the nature of their\nseparatrix surfaces. The magnetic skeleton reveals that, at solar maximum, the\nglobal coronal field involves a multitude of topological structures at all\nlatitudes. Many open-field regions exist originating anywhere on the\nphotosphere. At solar minimum, the coronal topology is heavily influenced by\nthe solar dipole. A strong dipole results in a simple large-scale structure\ninvolving just two large polar open-field regions, but, at short radial\ndistances between plus or minus 60 deg latitude, the small-scale topology is\ncomplex. If the solar dipole if weak, as in the recent minimum, then the\nlow-latitude quiet-sun magnetic fields may be globally significant enough to\ncreate many disconnected open-field regions at low latitudes, in addition to\nthe two polar open-field regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 09:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-23"}

Travel times are deduced from the cross-covariance of the random wave\nfield. Here we consider travel times and also products of travel times as\nobservables. They contain information about e.g. the statistical properties of\nconvection in the Sun. The basic assumption of the model is that noise is the\nresult of the stochastic excitation of solar waves, a random process which is\nstationary and Gaussian. We generalize the existing noise model (Gizon and\nBirch 2004) by dropping the assumption of horizontal spatial homogeneity. Using\na recurrence relation, we calculate the noise covariance matrices for the\nmoments of order 4, 6, and 8 of the observed wave field, for the moments of\norder 2, 3 and 4 of the cross-covariance, and for the moments of order 2, 3 and\n4 of the travel times. All noise covariance matrices depend only on the\nexpectation value of the cross-covariance of the observed wave field. For\nproducts of travel times, the noise covariance matrix consists of three terms\nproportional to $1/T$, $1/T^2$, and $1/T^3$, where $T$ is the duration of the\nobservations. For typical observation times of a few hours, the term\nproportional to $1/T^2$ dominates and $Cov[\\tau_1 \\tau_2, \\tau_3 \\tau_4]\n\\approx Cov[\\tau_1, \\tau_3] Cov[\\tau_2, \\tau_4] + Cov[\\tau_1, \\tau_4]\nCov[\\tau_2, \\tau_3]$, where the $\\tau_i$ are arbitrary travel times. This\nresult is confirmed for $p_1$ travel times by Monte Carlo simulations and\ncomparisons with SDO/HMI observations. General and accurate formulae have been\nderived to model the noise covariance matrix of helioseismic travel times and\nproducts of travel times. These results could easily be generalized to other\nmethods of local helioseismology, such as helioseismic holography and ring\ndiagram analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 09:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

Our\nmolecular dynamics simulation results show that the equilibrated structure is\nalways an aggregated state with remarkable structural rearrangements as we vary\nthe number of curcumin monomers from 4 to 16 monomers. We find that curcumin\nmonomers form clusters in a very definite pattern where they tend to aggregate\nboth in parallel and anti-parallel orientation of the phenyl rings, often seen\nin the formation of beta-sheet in proteins. A considerable enhancement in the\npopulation of parallel alignments is observed with increasing the system size\nfrom 12 to 16 curcumin monomers. Due to the prevalence of such parallel\nalignment for large system size, a more closely packed cluster is formed with\nmaximum number of hydrophobic contacts.

We find the existence of a metastable structural intermediate\ninvolving a number of intermediate-sized clusters dispersed in the solution.\nThe course of aggregation bears similarity to nucleation and growth in highly\nmetastable state. The final aggregated form remains stable with total exclusion\nof water from its sequestered hydrophobic core.

Since the launch of SDO/AIA, it has been\npossible to resolve transverse oscillations in off-limb solar polar plumes and\nrecently McIntosh et al. (2011, Nature, 475, 477) concluded that such waves are\nenergetic enough to play a role in heating the corona and accelerating the fast\nsolar wind. However, this result is based on comparisons to Monte Carlo\nsimulations and confirmation via direct measurements is still outstanding.\nThus, this letter reports on the first direct measurements of transverse wave\nmotions in solar polar plumes. Over a 4 hour period, we measure the transverse\ndisplacements, periods and velocity amplitudes of 596 distinct oscillations\nobserved in the 171 \\AA channel of SDO/AIA. We find a broad range of\nnon-uniformly distributed parameter values which are well described by\nlog-normal distributions with peaks at $234$ km, $121$ s and $8$ km s$^{-1}$,\nand mean and standard deviations of $407\\pm297$ km, $173\\pm118$ s and $14\\pm10$\nkm s$^{-1}$. Within standard deviations, our direct measurements are broadly\nconsistent with previous results. However, accounting for the whole of our\nobserved non-uniform parameter distribution we calculate an energy flux of\n$9-24$ W m$^{-2}$, which is $4-10$ times below the energy requirement for solar\nwind acceleration. Hence, our results indicate that transverse MHD waves as\nresolved by SDO/AIA cannot be the dominant energy source for fast solar wind\nacceleration in the open-field corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 10:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Firstly, by exploiting the deterministic high-speed train\ntrajectory, we present a time-distance mapping in order to obtain the highly\ndynamic link capacity effectively. Next, a novel service model is developed for\ndeadline constrained services with delivery ratio requirements, which enables\nus to turn the delivery ratio requirement into a single queue stability\nproblem.

We first show that this\nspectral seriation algorithm recovers the true ranking when all pairwise\ncomparisons are observed and consistent with a total order. We then show that\nranking reconstruction is still exact when some pairwise comparisons are\ncorrupted or missing, and that seriation based spectral ranking is more robust\nto noise than classical scoring methods. Finally, we bound the ranking error\nwhen only a random subset of the comparions are observed. An additional benefit\nof the seriation formulation is that it allows us to solve semi-supervised\nranking problems.

For central galaxies with\ninner compactness $\\Sigma_{\\rm 1kpc} \\sim 10^{9-9.4}M_{\\odot} {\\rm kpc}^{-2}$,\nthe quenched fraction $f_{q}$ is strongly correlated with $\\Sigma_{\\rm 1kpc}$\nwith only weak halo mass $M_{\\rm h}$ dependence.

In other words, $\\Sigma_{\\rm 1kpc} \\sim\n10^{9-9.4} M_{\\odot} {\\rm kpc}^{-2}$ divides galaxies into those with high sSFR\nbelow and low sSFR above this range.

The magnetic entropy\nS_m(T) grows moderately with temperature for y=0 due to a significant\ncontribution of excited levels at low energy, while at y=0.5 it shows a\nincipient plateau around S_m=Rln2. All these features reflect the progressive\nground state transformation of from itinerant to a local character. Another\npeculiarity of this system is the nearly constant value of C_m(T_N) that ends\nin an \"entropy bottleneck\" as T_N decreases. Consequently, the system shows a\ncritical point at y_{cr}~0.48 with signs of ferromagnetic behavior above\nH_{cr}~0.3T. A splitting of the C_m(T_N) maximum, tuned by field and\nconcentration, indicates a competition between two magnetic phases, with\nrespective peaks at T_N~1.2K and T_I~1.45K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 13:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The method requires, in principle, only a single, photospheric or\nlow-chromospheric, vector magnetogram of a quiet-Sun patch or an active region\nand performs calculations in the absence of three-dimensional magnetic and\nvelocity-field information. In this work we strictly validate this method using\nthree-dimensional coronal magnetic fields. Benchmarking employs both synthetic,\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations and nonlinear force-free\nfield extrapolations of the active-region solar corona. We find that our\ntime-efficient NLFF method provides budgets that differ from those of more\ndemanding semi-analytical methods by a factor of ~3, at most. This difference\nis expected from the physical concept and the construction of the method.\nTemporal correlations show more discrepancies that, however, are soundly\nimproved for more complex, massive active regions, reaching correlation\ncoefficients of the order of, or exceeding, 0.9.

We use the population\nsynthesis approach using an ABC-MCMC method to characterize the thick disc\nshape, scale height, scale length, local density and flare, and we investigate\nthe extend of the thick disc formation period by simulating several formation\nepisodes. We find that the vertical variation in density is not exponential,\nbut much closer to an hyperbolic secant squared. Assuming a single formation\nepoch, the thick disc is better fitted with a sech2 scale height of 470 pc and\na scale length of 2.3 kpc. However if one simulates two successive formation\nepisodes, mimicking an extended formation period, the older episode has a\nhigher scale height and a larger scale length than the younger episode,\nindicating a contraction during the collapse phase. The scale height decreases\nfrom 800 pc to 340 pc, and the scale length from 3.2 kpc to 2 kpc. The star\nformation increases from the old episode to the young one.

A\nhighly dissipative PDE system typically involves a spatial differential\noperator with eigenspectrum that can be partitioned into a finite-dimensional\nslow one and an infinite-dimensional stable fast complement. Motivated by this\nfact, the modal decomposition and singular perturbation techniques are\ninitially applied to the PDE system to derive a finite dimensional ordinary\ndifferential equation model, which accurately captures the dynamics of the slow\nmodes of the PDE system. Subsequently, based on the slow system and the\ntopology of the SN, a set of finite dimensional distributed consensus observers\nare constructed to estimate the state of the slow system. Then, a centralized\ncontrol scheme, which only uses the available estimates from a specified group\nof SN nodes, is proposed for the PDE system. An H-infinity control design\nmethod is developed in terms of bilinear matrix inequality (BMI), such that the\noriginal closed-loop PDE system is exponentially stable and a prescribed level\nof disturbance attenuation is satisfied for the slow system. Furthermore, a\nsuboptimal H-infinity controller is also provided to make the attenuation level\nas small as possible, which can be obtained via a local optimization algorithm\nthat treats the BMI as double linear matrix inequality.

Holt","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"physics.class-ph gr-qc","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  A brief summary of the objections to the relational nature of inertial mass,\ngravitational mass and electric charge is presented. The objections are refuted\nby showing that the measurement process of comparing an instrument reference\nclock and a reference rod both obeying the laws of physics to a system obeying\nthe same laws of physics results in relational quantities: inertial mass,\ngravitational mass and electric charge appear only as ratios. This means that\nscaling of the absolute inertial mass of every object in the universe by the\nsame factor is unobservable (likewise for gravitational mass and electric\ncharge). It is shown that the measurement process does not separate the\ninstrument parameters from the system parameters. Instead a measurement\nproduces functions of fundamental, dimensionless parameters such as the fine\nstructure constant, electron-proton mass ratio and the proton gyro-magnetic\nfactor. It is shown that the measurement of Planck's constant also results in\nsuch a function of these dimensionless parameters. Application of this analysis\nto the \"absolute\" Planck units shows that they too are functions only of\nrelational quantities. Analysis focuses initially on non-relativistic systems\nfor the sake of clarity and simplicity. The results are then extended to\nrelativistic systems described by the Dirac equation and the Einstein field\nequations of general relativity. The results support the assertion that\ninstrument parameters cannot be separated from system parameters even in\nclassical mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 18:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-24"}

To model the evolution towards equilibrium\nat each cooling step, we derive quantum kinetic equations that describe the\ndynamics of the gas for temperatures above and below the transition\ntemperature. These equations, valid in the Born and Markov approximations,\nconsider the essential role of the chemical potential as the main parameter\nthat signals the transition. The kinetic equation that describes the growth of\nthe condensate below the transition temperature is derived within the\nBogoliubov approximation. To illustrate our results we propose an energetic\ncooling protocol and simulate the whole sequence of the formation of a\ncondensate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 00:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Based\non the unique time-based parameters derived from wavelet coefficients and the\nasymmetry property of wavelets a novel algorithm to separate ERP components in\nsingle-trial EEG data is described. Though illustrated as a specific\napplication to N170 ERP detection, the algorithm is a generalized approach that\ncan be easily adapted to isolate different kinds of ERP components. The\nalgorithm detected the N170 ERP component with a high level of accuracy. We\ndemonstrate that the asymmetry method is more accurate than the matching\nwavelet algorithm and t-CWT method by 48.67 and 8.03 percent respectively.
