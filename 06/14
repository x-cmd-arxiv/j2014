However, in\nmany magnetic pyrochlore oxides, geometrical frustration suppresses\nconventional LRO while at the same time non-trivial spin correlations are\nobserved. For such materials, a natural question to ask then is what is the\nnature of the excitations in this highly correlated state without broken\nsymmetry? Frequently the application of a symmetry breaking field can stabilize\nexcitations whose properties still reflect certain aspects of the anomalous\nstate without long-range order. Here we report evidence of novel magnetic\nexcitations in the quantum spin ice material Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, obtained from\ntime-domain terahertz spectroscopy (TDTS). At large fields, both magnon and\ntwo-magnon-like excitations are observed in a $<$001$>$ directed magnetic field\nillustrating the stabilization of a field induced LRO state. The unique ability\nof TDTS to measure complex response functions allows a direct study of magnetic\nresponses in different polarization channels, revealing the existence of an\nunusual left-hand polarized magnon. The g-factors of these excitations are\ndramatically enhanced in the low-field limit, showing a cross-over of these\none- and two-magnon states into features consistent with quantum string-like\nexcitations proposed to exist in quantum spin ice in a small $<$001$>$ applied\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 16:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

For this purpose, a set of\nD slits with complex transmission are displayed on a spatial light modulator\n(SLM). In a recent work we have shown a method that requires a single\nphase-only SLM to control independently the complex coefficients which define\nthe quantum state of dimension D. The amplitude information was codified by\nintroducing phase gratings inside each slit and the phase value of the complex\ntransmission was added to the phase gratings. After a spatial filtering process\nwe obtained in the image plane the desired qudit state. Although this method\nhas proven to be a good alternative to compact the previously reported\narchitectures, it presents some features that could be improved. In this paper\nwe present an alternative scheme to codify the required phase values that\nminimizes the effects of temporal phase fluctuations associated to the SLM\nwhere the codification is carried on. In this scheme the amplitudes are set by\nappropriate phase gratings addressed at the SLM while the relative phases are\nobtained by a lateral displacement of these phase gratings. We show that this\nmethod improves the quality of the prepared state and provides very high\nfidelities of preparation for any state. An additional advantage of this scheme\nis that a complete 2\\pi modulation is obtained by shifting the grating by one\nperiod, and hence the encoding is not limited by the phase modulation range\nachieved by the SLM. Numerical simulations, that take into account the phase\nfluctuations, show high fidelities for thousands of qubit states covering the\nwhole Bloch sphere surface. Similar analysis are performed for qudits with D =\n3 and D = 7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 17:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

It thus appears that some process\nhas pumped up Iapetus's inclination while leaving its eccentricity near zero\n(e=0.03 at present). Here we examined the possibility that Iapetus's\ninclination was excited during the early solar system instability when\nencounters between Saturn and ice giants occurred. We found that the dynamical\neffects of planetary encounters on Iapetus's orbit sensitively depend on the\ndistance of the few closest encounters.

In this work, we consider the\ncolouring model. A basic question here is whether the root's assignment affects\nthe distribution of the colourings at the vertices at distance h from the root.\nThis is the so-called \"reconstruction problem\". For a d-ary tree it is well\nknown that d/ln (d) is the reconstruction threshold. That is, for\nk=(1+eps)d/ln(d) we have non-reconstruction while for k=(1-eps)d/ln(d) we have.\n  Here, we consider the largely unstudied case where the underlying tree is\nchosen according to a predefined distribution. In particular, our focus is on\nthe well-known Galton-Watson trees. This model arises naturally in many\ncontexts, e.g. the theory of spin-glasses and its applications on random\nConstraint Satisfaction Problems (rCSP). The aforementioned study focuses on\nGalton-Watson trees with offspring distribution B(n,d/n), i.e. the binomial\nwith parameters n and d/n, where d is fixed. Here we consider a broader version\nof the problem, as we assume general offspring distribution, which includes\nB(n,d/n) as a special case.\n  Our approach relates the corresponding bounds for (non)reconstruction to\ncertain concentration properties of the offspring distribution. This allows to\nderive reconstruction thresholds for a very wide family of offspring\ndistributions, which includes B(n,d/n). A very interesting corollary is that\nfor distributions with expected offspring d, we get reconstruction threshold\nd/ln(d) under weaker concentration conditions than what we have in B(n,d/n).\n  Furthermore, our reconstruction threshold for the random colorings of\nGalton-Watson with offspring B(n,d/n), implies the reconstruction threshold for\nthe random colourings of G(n,d/n).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 19:49:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 23:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

In this work, we present first steps towards\nefficient experimental quantum field tomography. We employ our procedure to\ncapture ultracold atomic systems using atom chips, a setup that allows for the\nquantum simulation of static and dynamical properties of interacting quantum\nfields. Our procedure is based on cMPS, the continuous analogues of matrix\nproduct states (MPS), ubiquitous in condensed-matter theory. These states\nnaturally incorporate the locality present in realistic physical settings and\nare thus prime candidates for describing the physics of locally interacting\nquantum fields. The reconstruction procedure is based on two- and four-point\ncorrelation functions, from which we predict higher-order correlation\nfunctions, thus validating our reconstruction for the experimental situation at\nhand. We apply our procedure to quenched prethermalisation experiments for\nquasi-condensates. In this setting, we can use the quality of our tomographic\nreconstruction as a probe for the non-equilibrium nature of the involved\nphysical processes. We discuss the potential of such methods in the context of\npartial verification of analogue quantum simulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 20:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-25"}

Although compensation schemes\ncan cancel out part of these RF impairments, there still remains a certain\namount of impairments. These residual impairments have fundamental impact on\nthe MIMO system performance. However, most of the previous works have neglected\nthis factor. In this paper, a training-based MIMO system with residual transmit\nRF impairments (RTRI) is considered. In particular, we derive a new channel\nestimator for the proposed model, and find that RTRI can create an irreducible\nestimation error floor. Moreover, we show that, in the presence of RTRI, the\noptimal training sequence length can be larger than the number of transmit\nantennas, especially in the low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.\nAn increase in the proposed approximated achievable rate is also observed by\nadopting the optimal training sequence length.

These\nsystem-dependent pre-pulses in the nanosecond and/or picosecond regimes are\noften intense enough to modify the target significantly by ionizing and forming\na plasma layer in front of the target. Time resolved interferometry offers a\nrobust way to characterize the expanding plasma during this period. We have\ndeveloped a novel pump-probe interferometry system for an ultra-intense laser\nexperiment that uses two short-pulse amplifiers synchronized by one ultra-fast\nseed oscillator to achieve 40-femtosecond time resolution over hundreds of\nnanoseconds, using a variable delay line and other techniques. The first of\nthese amplifiers acts as the pump and delivers maximal energy to the\ninteraction region. The second amplifier is frequency shifted and then\nfrequency doubled to generate the femtosecond probe pulse. After passing\nthrough the laser-target interaction region, the probe pulse is split and\nrecombined in a laterally sheared Michelson interferometer. Importantly, the\nfrequency shift in the probe allows strong plasma self-emission at the second\nharmonic of the pump to be filtered out, allowing plasma expansion near the\ncritical surface and elsewhere to be clearly visible in the interferograms.\nThree-phase reconstructions of the electron densities are then inferred by Abel\ninversion. This interferometric system delivers precise measurements of\npre-plasma expansion that can identify the condition of the target at the\nmoment that the ultra-intense pulse arrives.

Assuming that the SM is a low energy\neffective theory of a cutoff theory residing at the Planck scale, we are able\nto calculate the effective bare parameters of the underlying cutoff system. It\nturns out that the effective bare mass term changes sign not far below the\nPlanck scale, which means that in the early universe the SM was in the\nsymmetric phase. The sign-flip, which is a result of a conspiracy between the\nSM couplings and their screening/antiscreening behavior, triggers the Higgs\nmechanism.

Likewise the quartically enhanced positive\nvacuum energy density is present in the symmetric phase. The Higgs system thus\nprovides the large dark energy density in the early universe, which triggers\nslow-roll inflation, i.e. the SM Higgs is the inflaton scalar field.

(2006). It is shown that unlike Hill's\n(1948), the latter macroscopic criterion quantitatively predicts the\nexperimental results, namely: that the sample with axial direction along the\nrolling direction contracts, while the sample with axial direction along the\nnormal direction elongates. Moreover, it is demonstrated that these\nexperimentally observed axial effects in torsion can be also quantitatively\npredicted with the VPSC polycrystal model only if both slip and twinning are\nconsidered active at single crystal level. On the other hand, if it is assumed\nthat the plastic deformation is fully accommodated by crystallographic slip,\nthe predicted axial strains are very close with that obtained with Hill (1948)\ncriterion, which largely underestimate the measured axial strains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jun 2014 00:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-17"}

This work builds upon the line of approach first explored by\nGao in $2001$. The general approach has been to implicitly construct a graph\nwith the roots as vertices and the edges formed by some polynomial time\ncomputable relation. The algorithm then fails to factor a polynomial if this\nassociated graph turns out to be \\emph{regular}. In the first part of our work\nwe strengthen the edge relation so that the resulting set of graphs we obtain\nare subgraphs of Gao's graphs, all of which must be \\emph{regular}.\n  In the second part of our work we strengthen the regularity condition of\nthese graphs. This is accomplished by finding a parallel between their\nalgorithms and the $1$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm for solving the\nGraph Isomorphism problem. We observe that the general principle behind their\nalgorithms is to separate the roots by computing the $1$-dimensional\nWeisfeiler-Leman approximation to the orbits of this graph. This leads us to\nthe natural question of whether this approximation may be improved. We then go\non to show how to implicitly compute the $2$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman\napproximation of the orbits of these graphs.

While the design of\nICAL is primarily optimized to measure muon momentum, it is also capable of\nmeasuring the hadron energy in each event. Although the hadron energy is\nmeasured with relatively lower resolution, it nevertheless contains crucial\ninformation on the event, which may be extracted when taken concomitant with\nthe muon data. We demonstrate that by adding the hadron energy information to\nthe muon energy and muon direction in each event, the sensitivity of ICAL to\nthe neutrino parameters can be improved significantly. Using the realistic\ndetector response for ICAL, we present its enhanced reach for determining the\nneutrino mass hierarchy, the atmospheric mass squared difference and the mixing\nangle theta23, including its octant. In particular, we show that the analysis\nthat uses hadron energy information can distinguish the normal and inverted\nmass hierarchies with Deltachi^2 approx 9 with 10 years exposure at the 50 kt\nICAL, which corresponds to about 40% improvement over the muon-only analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jun 2014 06:40:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Jan 2015 08:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This information is then used\nto create sophisticated, genuine-looking attack vectors, drawing the victim to\ncompromise confidential information. What makes spear phishing different, and\nmore powerful than normal phishing, is this contextual information about the\nvictim. Online social media services can be one such source for gathering vital\ninformation about an individual. In this paper, we characterize and examine a\ntrue positive dataset of spear phishing, spam, and normal phishing emails from\nSymantec's enterprise email scanning service. We then present a model to detect\nspear phishing emails sent to employees of 14 international organizations, by\nusing social features extracted from LinkedIn. Our dataset consists of 4,742\ntargeted attack emails sent to 2,434 victims, and 9,353 non targeted attack\nemails sent to 5,912 non victims; and publicly available information from their\nLinkedIn profiles. We applied various machine learning algorithms to this\nlabeled data, and achieved an overall maximum accuracy of 97.76% in identifying\nspear phishing emails.

This is the most easily\nstated problem on graphs whose parameterized complexity is still unknown. We\nprovide an fpt-reduction from $k$-clique to $k$-biclique, thus solving this\nlongstanding open problem.\n  Our reduction use a class of bipartite graphs with a threshold property of\nindependent interest. More specifically, for positive integers $n$, $s$ and\n$t$, we consider a bipartite graph $G=(A\\;\\dot\\cup\\;B, E)$ such that $A$ can be\npartitioned into $A=V_1\\;\\dot\\cup \\;V_2\\;\\dot\\cup\\cdots\\dot\\cup\\; V_n$ and for\nevery $s$ distinct indices $i_1\\cdots i_s$, there exist $v_{i_1}\\in\nV_{i_1}\\cdots v_{i_s}\\in V_{i_s}$ such that $v_{i_1}\\cdots v_{i_s}$ have at\nleast $t+1$ common neighbors in $B$; on the other hand, every $s+1$ distinct\nvertices in $A$ have at most $t$ common neighbors in $B$.\n  Using the Paley-type graphs and Weil's character sum theorem, we show that\nfor $t=(s+1)!$ and $n$ large enough, such threshold bipartite graphs can be\ncomputed in $n^{O(1)}$. One corollary of our reduction is that there is no\n$f(k)\\cdot n^{o(k)}$ time algorithm to decide whether a graph contains a\nsubgraph isomorphic to $K_{k!,k!}$ unless the ETH(Exponential Time Hypothesis)\nfails.

We find that the pulse amplitude varies\nproportionally with source flux through all phases of the flaring, indicating\nthat the flaring is likely due to mass density variations created at or outside\nthe magnetospheric boundary. We suggest that this 1--5~Hz flaring is a high\nmass accretion rate version of the 0.5--2~Hz flaring which is known to occur at\nlow luminosity ($<13$~mCrab), late in the tail of outbursts of SAX\nJ1808.4--3658. We propose the dead-disk instability, previously suggested as\nthe mechanism for the 0.5--2~Hz flaring, as a likely mechanism for the high\nluminosity flaring reported here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jun 2014 09:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-24"}

The properties of the\nmodels -- axis ratios, velocity dispersions, streaming velocities and\ndistribution functions -- are all discussed in some detail. We pose the\nquestion: are extremely flattened or disk-like haloes possible for the Milky\nWay galaxy? This has never been examined before, as very flattened halo models\nwere not available.

In\nparticular, we examine for a Gaussian distribution of the frequencies the\ntransition from incoherence to coherence for increasingly large system size and\ninertia. For sufficiently large inertia the transition is hysteretic and within\nthe hysteretic region clusters of locked oscillators of various sizes and\ndifferent levels of synchronization coexist. A modification of the mean field\ntheory developed by Tanaka, Lichtenberg, and Oishi [Physica D, 100 (1997) 279]\nallows to derive the synchronization profile associated to each of these\nclusters. We have also investigated numerically the limits of existence of the\ncoherent and of the incoherent solutions. The minimal coupling required to\nobserve the coherent state is largely independent of the system size and it\nsaturates to a constant value already for moderately large inertia values. The\nincoherent state is observable up to a critical coupling whose value saturates\nfor large inertia and for finite system sizes, while in the thermodinamic limit\nthis critical value diverges proportionally to the mass. By increasing the\ninertia the transition becomes more complex, and the synchronization occurs via\nthe emergence of clusters of whirling oscillators. The presence of these groups\nof coherently drifting oscillators induces oscillations in the order parameter.\nWe have shown that the transition remains hysteretic even for randomly diluted\nnetworks up to a level of connectivity corresponding to few links per\noscillator.
