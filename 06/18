Understanding how to find targets with very limited information is a topic\nof interest in many disciplines. In ecology, such research has often focused on\nthe development of two movement models: i) the L\\'evy walk and; ii) the\ncomposite correlated random walk and its associated area-restricted search\nbehaviour. Although the processes underlying these models differ, they can\nproduce similar movement patterns. Due to this similarity and because of their\ndisparate formulation, current methods cannot reliably differentiate between\nthese two models.\n  2. Here, we present a method that differentiates between the two models. It\nconsists of likelihood functions, including one for a hidden Markov model, and\nassociated statistical measures that assess the relative support for and\nabsolute fit of each model.\n  3. Using a simulation study, we show that our method can differentiate\nbetween the two search models over a range of parameter values. Using the\nmovement data of two polar bears (\\textit{Ursus maritimus}), we show that the\nmethod can be applied to complex, real-world movement paths.\n  4.

Fluid dynamics predicts this circular\nmotion to be clockwise (CW) above a rigid surface (when viewed from inside the\nfluid) and counter-clockwise (CCW) below a free surface. Recent experimental\ninvestigations showed that complex physicochemical processes at the nearby\nsurface could lead to a change in the direction of rotation, both at solid\nsurfaces absorbing slip-inducing polymers and interfaces covered with\nsurfactants. Motivated by these results, we use a far-field hydrodynamic model\nto predict the kinematics of swimming near three types of interfaces: clean\nfluid-fluid interface, slipping rigid wall, and a fluid interface covered by\nincompressible surfactants. Representing the helical swimmer by a superposition\nof hydrodynamic singularities, we first show that in all cases the surfaces\nreorient the swimmer parallel to the surface and attract it, both of which are\na consequence of the Stokes dipole component of the swimmer flow field. We then\nshow that circular motion is induced by a higher-order singularity, namely a\nrotlet dipole, and that its rotation direction (CW vs. CCW) is strongly\naffected by the boundary conditions at the interface and the bacteria shape.\nOur results suggest thus that the hydrodynamics of complex interfaces provide a\nmechanism to selectively stir bacteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 16:09:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 08:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-18"}

In addition, this exponential property is so strong that it\ngives definite answers for several questions: why Horn-SAT has the intermediate\nproperty between 2-SAT and 3-SAT; why random-SAT is so easy; and why k-SAT\n(k>2) cannot be solved with the linear programming technique. As we know, 2-SAT\nis NL-complete, Horn-SAT is P-complete, and k-SAT (k>2) is NP-complete. In\nterms of computational complexity, this paper gives a clear mathematical\nproperty by which SAT problems in three different classes are distinguished.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 16:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 18:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2018 18:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-25"}

The proposed methods are formulated\nfor the BGK equation with constant or spatially variant Knudsen number. The new\ningredients for the proposed methods to achieve high order accuracy are the\nfollowing: we introduce discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization of arbitrary\norder of accuracy with nodal Lagrangian basis functions in space; we employ a\nhigh order globally stiffly accurate implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta (RK)\nscheme as time discretization.

After testing the method\non simulated, but realistic filaments, we apply the algorithms to\ncolumn-density maps computed from Herschel observations of the Galactic Plane\nobtained by the Hi-GAL project.

MPTCP is\nparticularly useful for mobile devices, which usually have multiple wireless\ninterfaces. However, these devices have limited power capacity and thus\njudicious use of these interfaces is required. In this work, we develop a model\nfor MPTCP energy consumption derived from experimental measurements using MPTCP\non a mobile device with both cellular and WiFi interfaces. Using our energy\nmodel, we identify an operating region where there is scope to improve power\nefficiency compared to both standard TCP and MPTCP. We design and implement an\nimproved energy-efficient MPTCP, called eMPTCP. We evaluate eMPTCP on a mobile\ndevice across several scenarios, including varying bandwidth, background\ntraffic, and user mobility. Our results show that eMPTCP can reduce the power\nconsumption by up to 15% compared with MPTCP, while preserving the availability\nand robustness benefits of MPTCP.

We propose a method to\nassimilate dead fuel moisture content observations from remote automated\nweather stations (RAWS) into a time-lag fuel moisture model. RAWS are spatially\nsparse and a mechanism is needed to estimate fuel moisture content at locations\npotentially distant from observational stations. This is arranged using a trend\nsurface model (TSM), which allows us to account for the effects of topography\nand atmospheric state on the spatial variability of fuel moisture content. At\neach location of interest, the TSM provides a pseudo-observation, which is\nassimilated via Kalman filtering. The method is tested with the time-lag fuel\nmoisture model in the coupled weather-fire code WRF-SFIRE on 10-hr fuel\nmoisture content observations from Colorado RAWS in 2013. We show using\nleave-one-out testing that the TSM compares favorably with inverse squared\ndistance interpolation as used in the Wildland Fire Assessment System.

Among all motion estimation approaches, Block-matching (BM)\nalgorithms are the most popular methods due to their effectiveness and\nsimplicity for both software and hardware implementations. A BM approach\nassumes that the movement of pixels within a defined region of the current\nframe can be modeled as a translation of pixels contained in the previous\nframe. In this procedure, the motion vector is obtained by minimizing a certain\nmatching metric that is produced for the current frame over a determined search\nwindow from the previous frame. Unfortunately, the evaluation of such matching\nmeasurement is computationally expensive and represents the most consuming\noperation in the BM process. Therefore, BM motion estimation can be viewed as\nan optimization problem whose goal is to find the best-matching block within a\nsearch space. The simplest available BM method is the Full Search Algorithm\n(FSA) which finds the most accurate motion vector through an exhaustive\ncomputation of all the elements of the search space. Recently, several fast BM\nalgorithms have been proposed to reduce the search positions by calculating\nonly a fixed subset of motion vectors despite lowering its accuracy. On the\nother hand, the Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is a population-based\noptimization method that is inspired by the music improvisation process in\nwhich a musician searches for harmony and continues to polish the pitches to\nobtain a better harmony. In this paper, a new BM algorithm that combines HS\nwith a fitness approximation model is proposed. The approach uses motion\nvectors belonging to the search window as potential solutions. A fitness\nfunction evaluates the matching quality of each motion vector candidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 19:13:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-18"}

The total molecular gas mass is M_{mol} ~\n9^{+19}_{-6} x 10^8 Msun, mostly distributed in a compact rotating disk at the\nprimary nucleus (M_{mol} ~ 3 x 10^8 Msun) and an extended tidal arm (M_{mol} ~\n5 x 10^8 Msun).

The\noutflowing mass of M_{mol} ~ 7 x 10^7 Msun and the short dynamical time of\nt_{dyn} ~ 0.6 Myr yield a very high outflow rate of \\dot{M}_{mol} ~ 350 Msun/yr\nand can deplete the gas in a million years.

Therefore, the\nactive galactic nucleus, with a bolometric luminosity of 10^46 erg/s, likely\npowers the outflow. The momentum boost rate of the outflow (\\dot{p}/(Lbol/c) ~\n3) is lower than typical molecular outflows associated with AGN, which may be\nrelated to its compactness.

The main one is to expound the idea of renormalization in\nquantum field theory, with no technical prerequisites (Sections 2 and 3). Our\nmotivation is that renormalization is undoubtedly one of the great ideas, and\ngreat successes, of twentieth-century physics. Also it has strongly influenced\nin diverse ways, how physicists conceive of physical theories. So it is of\nconsiderable philosophical interest. Second, we will briefly relate\nrenormalization to Ernest Nagel's account of inter-theoretic relations,\nespecially reduction (Section 4).\n  One theme will be a contrast between two approaches to renormalization. The\nold approach, which prevailed from ca. 1945 to 1970, treated renormalizability\nas a necessary condition for being an acceptable quantum field theory. On this\napproach, it is a piece of great good fortune that high energy physicists can\nformulate renormalizable quantum field theories that are so empirically\nsuccessful. But the new approach to renormalization (from 1970 onwards)\nexplains why the phenomena we see, at the energies we can access in our\nparticle accelerators, are described by a renormalizable quantum field theory.\nFor whatever non-renormalizable interactions may occur at yet higher energies,\nthey are insignificant at accessible energies. Thus the new approach explains\nwhy our best fundamental theories have a feature, viz. renormalizability, which\nthe old approach treated as a selection principle for theories.\n  We also maintain that universality, a concept stressed in renormalization\ntheory, is essentially the familiar philosophical idea of multiple\nrealizability; and that it causes no problems for reductions of a Nagelian\nkind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 20:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-19"}

The stars I consider are\nmostly within 1 kpc of the Sun. Based on a Monte-Carlo analysis of the data and\ncomparison with a toy model, I suggest the thick disk formed fairly rapidly\nwhen [Mg/Fe] ${\\approx}$0.2-0.3. We consider an origin via direct accretion\nunlikely as the thick disk is fast-rotating and fairly metal-rich for its age.\nAs internal disk heating can not easily reach the high observed velocity\ndispersions and would likely be more gradual, it also appears implausible. A\nvery early formation of the thick disk (e.g. from star formation in the\ncollapsing primordial gas cloud of the Milky Way) appears unlikely given it\nwould require [Mg/Fe] ${\\geq}$ 0.4 at the time the thick disk formed. An origin\nvia tidal interaction with another galaxy is one of the few remaining\npossibilities. My proposed explanation for the nature of the event which formed\nthe thick disk is a close flyby of Andromeda, whose orbital dynamics in MOND\nare consistent with my estimate that the event occurred 7-11 Gyr ago. This\nleads to reasonable thick disk velocity dispersions. It will be important to\ndetermine whether the event heated the outer regions of the thin disk uniformly\nor if substantial portions of it were left largely unaffected. This may\ndistinguish between models (like mine) involving a single close encounter and\nmodels with multiple encounters (as common in mergers). The main limiting\nfactor at present seems to be the accuracy of elemental abundances and lack of\ndirect observations at different galactocentric radii to the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 20:50:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 21:03:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2014 02:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-26"}

For\ndeterministic sampling we obtain a discrepancy of $O(n^{-1/d})$ for $d\\ge2$.\nFor random stratified sampling, and scrambled van der Corput points, we get a\nmean squared error of $O(n^{-1-2/d})$ for integration of Lipshitz continuous\nintegrands, when $d\\ge3$. These rates are the same as one gets by sampling on\n$d$ dimensional grids and they show a deterioration with increasing $d$. The\nrate for Lipshitz functions is however best possible at that level of\nsmoothness and is better than plain IID sampling. Unlike grids, space-filling\ncurve sampling provides points at any desired sample size, and the van der\nCorput version is extensible in $n$. Additionally we show that certain\ndiscontinuous functions with infinite variation in the sense of Hardy and\nKrause can be integrated with a mean squared error of $O(n^{-1-1/d})$. It was\npreviously known only that the rate was $o(n^{-1})$. Other space-filling\ncurves, such as those due to Sierpinski and Peano, also attain these rates,\nwhile upper bounds for the Lebesgue curve are somewhat worse, as if the\ndimension were $\\log_2(3)$ times as high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 22:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-19"}

We define what a ghost field is and we show that its\npresence is associated to a classical instability whenever the ghost field\ninteracts with standard fields. We then show that the instability is more\nsevere at quantum level, and that perturbative ghosts can exist only in low\nenergy effective theories. However, if we don't consider very ad-hoc choices,\ncompatibility with observational constraints implies that low energy effective\nghosts can exist only at the price of giving up Lorentz-invariance or locality\nabove the cut-off, in which case the cut-off has to be much lower that the\nenergy scales we currently probe in particle colliders. We also comment on the\npossible role of extra degrees of freedom which break Lorentz-invariance\nspontaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 22:14:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 11:50:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Jun 2014 21:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 17:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}

The As and Se abundances are enhanced relative to\na simple extrapolation of the iron-peak abundances to higher masses, suggesting\nthat this mass region (75 < A < 82) may be the point at which a different\nnucleosynthetic mechanism begins to dominate the quasi-equilibrium alpha-rich\nfreezeout of the iron peak. <[CuII/CuI]> = +0.56 +/- 0.23 in HD 108317 and HD\n128279, and we infer that lines of Cu I may not be formed in local\nthermodynamic equilibrium in these stars.

We carry out a\nsearch for the stochastic background with the latest data from LIGO and Virgo.\nConsistent with predictions from most stochastic gravitational-wave background\nmodels, the data display no evidence of a stochastic gravitational-wave signal.\nAssuming a gravitational-wave spectrum of\nOmega_GW(f)=Omega_alpha*(f/f_ref)^alpha, we place 95% confidence level upper\nlimits on the energy density of the background in each of four frequency bands\nspanning 41.5-1726 Hz. In the frequency band of 41.5-169.25 Hz for a spectral\nindex of alpha=0, we constrain the energy density of the stochastic background\nto be Omega_GW(f)<5.6x10^-6. For the 600-1000 Hz band, Omega_GW(f)<0.14*(f/900\nHz)^3, a factor of 2.5 lower than the best previously reported upper limits.

The limits in these four bands are the lowest\ndirect measurements to date on the stochastic background. We discuss the\nimplications of these results in light of the recent claim by the BICEP2\nexperiment of the possible evidence for inflationary gravitational waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 23:38:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 23:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

We\nuse a family of birth-death models where individuals may remain in the tree\nprocess after the sampling, in particular we extend the birth-death skyline\nmodel [Stadler et al, 2013] to sampled ancestor trees. This method allows the\ndetection of sampled ancestors as well as estimation of the probability that an\nindividual will be removed from the process when it is sampled. We show that\nsampled ancestor birth-death models where all samples come from different time\npoints are non-identifiable and thus require one parameter to be known in order\nto infer other parameters. We apply this method to epidemiological data, where\nthe possibility of sampled ancestors enables us to identify individuals that\ninfected other individuals after being sampled and to infer fundamental\nepidemiological parameters. We also apply the method to infer divergence times\nand diversification rates when fossils are included among the species samples,\nso that fossilisation events are modelled as a part of the tree branching\nprocess.

The parameter constraints associated with a causal\ninvertible VARMA model are highly complex. Currently there are no procedures\nthat can maintain the constraints in the estimated VARMA process, except in the\nspecial case of a vector autoregression (VAR), where some moment based causal\nestimators are available. Even in the VAR case, the available likelihood based\nestimators are not causal. The maximum likelihood estimator based on the full\nlikelihood that does not condition on the initial observations by definition\nsatisfies the causal invertible constraints but optimization of the likelihood\nunder the complex constraints is an intractable problem. The commonly used\nBayesian procedure for VAR often has posterior mass outside the causal set\nbecause the priors are not constrained to the causal set of parameters.\n  We provide an exact mathematical solution to this problem.

The incomplete description of these atmospheres by the models\nresults in serious problems with the description of spectra of these stars and\nsubsequent difficulties in derivation of their surface parameters. Here, we\naddress the problem of infrared (IR) opacities in the atmospheres of cool white\ndwarfs by direct $ab$ $initio$ simulations of IR absorption of dense helium.\n  Methods: We applied state-of-the-art density functional theory-based quantum\nmolecular dynamics simulations to obtain the time evolution of the induced\ndipole moment. The IR absorption coefficients were obtained by the Fourier\ntransform of the dipole moment time autocorrelation function.\n  Results: We found that a dipole moment is induced due to three- and more-body\nsimultaneous collisions between helium atoms in highly compressed helium. This\nresults in a significant IR absorption that is directly proportional to $\\rm\n\\rho_{\\rm He}^3$, where $\\rho_{\\rm He}$ is the density of helium. To our\nknowledge, this absorption mechanism has never been measured or computed before\nand is therefore not accounted for in the current atmosphere models. It should\ndominate the other collisionally induced absorptions (CIA), arising from $\\rm\nH-He$ and $\\rm H_2-He$ pair collisions, and therefore shape the IR spectra of\nhelium-dominated and pure helium atmosphere cool white dwarfs for $\\rm\nHe/H>10^4$.\n  Conclusions: Our work shows that there exists an unaccounted IR absorption\nmechanism arising from the multi-collisions between He atoms in the helium-rich\natmospheres of cool white dwarfs, including pure helium atmospheres. This\nabsorption may be responsible for a yet unexplained frequency dependence of\nnear- and mid- IR spectra of helium-rich stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 04:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-19"}

Taking into account environmental exposures and their interactions\nwith genetic factors in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can help to\nidentify high-risk subgroups in the population and provide a better\nunderstanding of the disease. For this reason, many methods have been developed\nto detect gene-environment (G*E) interactions. Despite this, few loci that\ninteract with environmental exposures have been identified so far. Indeed, the\nmodest effect of G*E interactions as well as confounding factors entail low\nstatistical power to detect such interactions. In this work, we provide a\nsimulated dataset in order to study methods for detecting G*E interactions in\nGWAS in presence of confounding factor and population structure.

Storage,\nbroadly speaking, provides the flexibility of shifting energy over time;\nnetwork, on the other hand, provides the flexibility of shifting energy over\ngeographical locations. The optimal control of storage networks in stochastic\nenvironments is an important open problem. The key challenge is that, even in\nsmall networks, the corresponding constrained stochastic control problems on\ncontinuous spaces suffer from curses of dimensionality, and are intractable in\ngeneral settings. For large networks, no efficient algorithm is known to give\noptimal or provably near-optimal performance for this problem. This paper\nprovides an efficient algorithm to solve this problem with performance\nguarantees. We study the operation of storage networks, i.e., a storage system\ninterconnected via a power network. An online algorithm, termed Online Modified\nGreedy algorithm, is developed for the corresponding constrained stochastic\ncontrol problem. A sub-optimality bound for the algorithm is derived, and a\nsemidefinite program is constructed to minimize the bound. In many cases, the\nbound approaches zero so that the algorithm is near-optimal.

It is the inhomogeneity of the\nchiral scalar condensate that drives the spatial modulations of the\npseudoscalar one. The result has broader implications once we start to think of\nfundamental theories behind the effective models. In particular, some effective\ninteractions---which may be omitted for descriptions of the homogeneous\nphases---can be dynamically enhanced due to the spatial modulations of the\nlarge mean fields. Implications for the four-dimensional counterparts of the GN\nmodel are discussed. In a quark matter context, proper forms of the effective\nmodels for the inhomogeneous phases are speculated, through considerations on\nthe Fermi-Dirac sea coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 08:19:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 18:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

In contrast,\nmaximum likelihood estimates may get trapped in local optima due to the\nnon-convex nature of the likelihood function of latent variable models. In this\npaper, we do an empirical evaluation of spectral learning (SL) and expectation\nmaximization (EM), which reveals an important gap between the theory and the\npractice. First, SL often leads to negative probabilities. Second, EM often\nyields better estimates than spectral learning and it does not seem to get\nstuck in local optima. We discuss how the rank of the model parameters and the\namount of training data can yield negative probabilities. We also question the\ncommon belief that maximum likelihood estimators are necessarily inconsistent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 08:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-19"}

This is achieved by a\nsuitable energy dependence of the transmission coefficient connecting the\nsystem to the reservoir.

Using the complementary H-alpha\nphotometry carried out in two seasons separated by over 10 years, we find that\nthe cluster is very rich in Be stars. In total, 15 stars in the observed field\nof which 14 are cluster members showed H-alpha in emission either during our\nobservations or in the past. Most of the Be stars vary in brightness on\ndifferent time scales including short-period variability related most likely to\ng-mode pulsations. A single-epoch spectrum of NGC457-6 shows that this Be star\nis presently in the shell phase. The inventory of variable stars in the\nobserved field consists of a single BCep-type star, NGC457-8, 13 Be stars, 21\nslowly pulsating B stars, seven DSct stars, one GDor star, 16 unclassified\nperiodic stars, 8 eclipsing systems and a dozen of stars with irregular\nvariability, of which six are also B-type stars. As many as 45 variable stars\nare of spectral type B which is the largest number in all open clusters\npresented in this series of papers. The most interesting is the discovery of a\nlarge group of slowly pulsating B stars which occupy the cluster main sequence\nin the range between V=11 and 14.5 mag, corresponding to spectral types B3 to\nB8. They all have very low amplitudes and about half show pulsations with\nfrequencies higher than 3 c/d. We argue that these are most likely\nfast-rotating slowly pulsating B stars, observed also in other open clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 09:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-19"}

For distributions on a continuous state space, one can\nfind diffusions with the target distribution as equilibrium measure, so that\nthe state of the diffusion after a long time provides a good sample from the\ndesired distribution. There exist many diffusions with a common equilibrium,\nand one would naturally like to choose those that make the convergence to\nequilibrium faster. One way to do this is to consider a reversible diffusion,\nand add to it an antisymmetric drift which preserves the invariant measure. It\nhas been proven that, in general, the irreversible algorithm performs better\nthan the reversible one, in that the spectral gap is larger. In the present\nwork, asymptotic variance is used as the criterion to compare these algorithms.\nWe first provide a general comparison result, and then apply it to the specific\ncases of a diffusion on $\\mathbb{R}^d$, or on a compact Riemannian manifold. We\nprove that, in general, adding an antisymmetric drift to a reversible diffusion\nreduces the asymptotic variance.

Field-aligned flows appear frequently in coronal\nloops.We examine the effects of transverse density and plasma flow structuring\non standing sausage modes trapped in coronal loops, and examine their\nobservational implications. We model coronal loops as straight cold cylinders\nwith plasma flow embedded in a static corona. An eigen-value problem governing\npropagating sausage waves is formulated, its solutions used to construct\nstanding modes. Two transverse profiles are distinguished, one being the\ngeneralized Epstein distribution (profile E) and the other (N) proposed\nrecently in Nakariakov et al.(2012). A parameter study is performed on the\ndependence of the maximum period $P_\\mathrm{max}$ and cutoff length-to-radius\nratio $(L/a)_{\\mathrm{cutoff}}$ in the trapped regime on the density parameters\n($\\rho_0/\\rho_\\infty$ and profile steepness $p$) and flow parameters (magnitude\n$U_0$ and profile steepness $u$). For either profile, introducing a flow\nreduces $P_\\mathrm{max}$ relative to the static case. $P_\\mathrm{max}$ depends\nsensitively on $p$ for profile N but is insensitive to $p$ for profile E. By\nfar the most important effect a flow introduces is to reduce the capability for\nloops to trap standing sausage modes: $(L/a)_{\\mathrm{cutoff}}$ may be\nsubstantially reduced in the case with flow relative to the static one. If the\ndensity distribution can be described by profile N, then measuring the sausage\nmode period can help deduce the density profile steepness. However, this\npractice is not feasible if profile E better describes the density\ndistribution. Furthermore, even field-aligned flows with magnitudes\nsubstantially smaller than the ambient Alfv\\'en speed can make coronal loops\nconsiderably less likely to support trapped standing sausage modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 11:31:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

Closed-form expression of\nthe sum distribution is usually intractable and presents an open problem. A\ncrude Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is the standard technique for the estimation\nof this type of probability. However, this approach is computationally\nexpensive especially when dealing with rare events (i.e events with very small\nprobabilities). Importance Sampling (IS) is an alternative approach which\neffectively improves the computational efficiency of the MC simulation. In this\npaper, we develop a general framework based on IS approach for the efficient\nestimation of the probability that the sum of independent and not necessarily\nidentically distributed heavy-tailed RVs exceeds a given threshold. The\nproposed IS approach is based on constructing a new sampling distribution by\ntwisting the hazard rate of the original underlying distribution of each\ncomponent in the summation.

Firstly, the semantics of\ndeterminers does not follow the syntactical structure of the sentence. Secondly\nthe standard interpretation of the indefinite article cannot ac- count for\nnominal sentences. Thirdly, the standard view misses the linguis- tic asymmetry\nbetween the two properties of a generalised quantifier. In the sequel, we\npropose a treatment of determiners and quantifiers as Hilbert terms in a richly\ntyped system that we initially developed for lexical semantics, using a many\nsorted logic for semantical representations. We present this semantical\nframework called the Montagovian generative lexicon and show how these terms\nbetter match the syntactical structure and avoid the aforementioned problems of\nthe standard approach. Hilbert terms rather differ from choice functions in\nthat there is one polymorphic operator and not one operator per formula. They\nalso open an intriguing connection between the logic for meaning assembly, the\ntyped lambda calculus handling compositionality and the many-sorted logic for\nsemantical representations. Furthermore epsilon terms naturally introduce\ntype-judgements and confirm the claim that type judgment are a form of\npresupposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 13:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-02"}

In this work, we equip the networks with another pooling strategy,\n\"spatial pyramid pooling\", to eliminate the above requirement. The new network\nstructure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation\nregardless of image size/scale. Pyramid pooling is also robust to object\ndeformations. With these advantages, SPP-net should in general improve all\nCNN-based image classification methods.

Using SPP-net,\nwe compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool\nfeatures in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length\nrepresentations for training the detectors.

The main point is\nuncontroversial and applies equally to classical and quantum physics. It\nconcerns the fact that perceptual processing is so rapid, compared with the\ntypical time-scale on which macroscopic objects change their observable\nproperties, that it engenders the idea of a 'common now', spread across space.\n  The other two connections are specific to quantum theory, as interpreted\nalong the lines of Everett. So for these two connections, the physics side is\ncontroversial, just as the philosophical side is.\n  In Section 3, I connect the subjective uncertainty before an Everettian\n'splitting' of the multiverse to Dummett's suggestion, inspired by McTaggart,\nthat a complete, i.e. indexical-free description of a temporal reality is\nimpossible. And in Section 4, I connect Barbour's denial that time is real---a\ndenial along the lines of Everett, rather than McTaggart---to Dummett's\nsuggestion that statements about the past are not determinately true or false,\nbecause they are not effectively decidable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 14:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-19"}

This region lies between the instability strips of the\ndelta Scuti and SPB stars. Moreover the periods of the new phenomenon,\nP~0.1-0.7 d, do not allow to associate it a priori to either of these two types\nof pulsations. Stars in the NGC 3766 cluster are known as fast rotators with\nrotational velocities typically larger than half of their critical velocity.\nRotation can affect both the geometrical properties and period domain of\npulsations.

We carry out an instability analysis of\nSPB models within the framework of the Traditional Approximation of Rotation\nand study the visibility of modes according to the angle of view and rotation.\nWe also check how gravity darkening affects the effective temperature and\nluminosity of stellar models for different angles of view and rotation\nvelocities. At the red (cold) border of the instability strip, prograde\nsectoral modes are preferentially excited and their visibilities are maximum\nwhen seen equator-on.

An important\nrole is played by the formation and propagation of solitons, with two different\ndynamical regimes characterizing the dynamics of the phase string. Our analysis\nallows to evidence the effects of different bias current densities, that is a\nsimple spatially homogeneous distribution and a more realistic inhomogeneous\ndistribution with high current values at the junction edges. Stochastic\nresonant activation, noise enhanced stability and temporary trapping phenomena\nare observed in the system investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 17:21:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 18:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}
