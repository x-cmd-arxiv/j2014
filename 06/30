The\nauthors of this method have attempted to prove the its usefulness by applying a\nspecific forecasting procedure and determining the effectiveness of this\nprocedure on the decomposed time series, as compared with the original time\nseries. This is problematic in at least two ways. First, the choice of the\nforecasting procedure obviously has an effect on the results, rendering them\nnon-exhaustive.

Some\nof these ventures are internet-based: Wikipedia, online forums and communities.\nOthers are off-line: in medicine, science, and everyday life. Such ventures\nhave been affecting traditional firms, and may represent a new organizational\nform. Despite the impact of such ventures, questions remain about their\noperating principles and performance. Here we define open collaboration (OC),\nthe underlying set of principles, and propose that it is a robust engine for\ninnovation and production. First, we review multiple OC ventures and identify\nfour defining principles. In all instances, participants create goods and\nservices of economic value, they exchange and reuse each other's work, they\nlabor purposefully with just loose coordination, and they permit anyone to\ncontribute and consume. These principles distinguish OC from other\norganizational forms, such as firms or cooperatives. Next, we turn to\nperformance. To understand the performance of OC, we develop a computational\nmodel, combining innovation theory with recent evidence on human cooperation.\nWe identify and investigate three elements that affect performance: the\ncooperativeness of participants, the diversity of their needs, and the degree\nto which the goods are rival (subtractable). Through computational experiments,\nwe find that OC performs well even in seemingly harsh environments: when\ncooperators are a minority, free riders are present, diversity is lacking, or\ngoods are rival. We conclude that OC is viable and likely to expand into new\ndomains. The findings also inform the discussion on new organizational forms,\ncollaborative and communal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jun 2014 19:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-01"}

This\npaper argues that the system does this through a process analogous to neural\nnetwork learning with relative status playing the role of synaptic weights.\nHazy showed computationally that learning of this type can occur even when\nresource allocation decision makers have no direct visibility into the\nenvironment, have no direct understanding of the opportunity, and are not\ninvolved in their exploitation except to the extent that they evaluate the\nsuccess or failure of funded projects. Effectively, the system of interactions\nlearns which individuals have the best access to information and other\nresources within the ecosystem. Hazy [2012] calls this previously unidentified\nemergence phenomenon: Influence Process Structural Learning (IPSL). In the\nprior model of IPSL, a three-tiered organizational structure was predetermined\nin the model design [Hazy 2012]. These initial conditions delimit the extent to\nwhich the emergence of collective intelligence can be posited because the model\nitself assumes a defined structure. This work contributes to the field by\nextending the IPSL argument for collective intelligence to a holistic emergence\nargument. It begins by briefly reviewing previously published work. It\ncontinues the conversation by adding two additional steps: Firstly, it shows\nhow a three-tier organizing structure might emerge through known complexity\nmechanisms. In this case the mechanism identified is preferential attachment\n[Barabasi 2002]. Secondly, the paper shows how collective intelligence can\nemerge within a system of agents when the influence structure among these\nagents is treated as a the genetic algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jun 2014 19:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-01"}

However, a role for selection in\ncultural evolutionary dynamics is less clear. Often neutral evolution (also\nknown as 'drift') models, are used to explain the evolution of human\ncommunication systems, and cultural evolution more generally. Under this\naccount, cultural change is unbiased: for instance, vocabulary, baby names and\npottery designs have been found to spread through random copying.\n  While drift is the null hypothesis for models of cultural evolution it does\nnot always adequately explain empirical results. Alternative models include\ncultural selection, which assumes variant adoption is biased. Theoretical\nmodels of human communication argue that during conversation interlocutors are\nbiased to adopt the same labels and other aspects of linguistic representation\n(including prosody and syntax). This basic alignment mechanism has been\nextended by computer simulation to account for the emergence of linguistic\nconventions. When agents are biased to match the linguistic behavior of their\ninterlocutor, a single variant can propagate across an entire population of\ninteracting computer agents. This behavior-matching account operates at the\nlevel of the individual. We call it the Conformity-biased model. Under a\ndifferent selection account, called content-biased selection, functional\nselection or replicator selection, variant adoption depends upon the intrinsic\nvalue of the particular variant (e.g., ease of learning or use). This second\nalternative account operates at the level of the cultural variant. Following\nBoyd and Richerson we call it the Content-biased model. The present paper tests\nthe drift model and the two biased selection models' ability to explain the\nspread of communicative signal variants in an experimental micro-society.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jun 2014 20:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-01"}

Less is known, however,\nabout the generality of crowd wisdom. For example, are crowds wise even if\ntheir members have systematic judgmental biases, or can influence each other\nbefore members render their judgments? If so, are there situations in which we\ncan expect a crowd to be less accurate than skilled individuals? We provide a\nprecise but general definition of crowd wisdom: A crowd is wise if a linear\naggregate, for example a mean, of its members' judgments is closer to the\ntarget value than a randomly, but not necessarily uniformly, sampled member of\nthe crowd. Building on this definition, we develop a theoretical framework for\nexamining, a priori, when and to what degree a crowd will be wise. We\nsystematically investigate the boundary conditions for crowd wisdom within this\nframework and determine conditions under which the accuracy advantage for\ncrowds is maximized. Our results demonstrate that crowd wisdom is highly\nrobust: Even if judgments are biased and correlated, one would need to nearly\ndeterministically select only a highly skilled judge before an individual's\njudgment could be expected to be more accurate than a simple averaging of the\ncrowd. Our results also provide an accuracy rationale behind the need for\ndiversity of judgments among group members. Contrary to folk explanations of\ncrowd wisdom which hold that judgments should ideally be independent so that\nerrors cancel out, we find that crowd wisdom is maximized when judgments\nsystematically differ as much as possible.

Additionally, the recent discovery of\nstellar binary companions ~1\" from WASP-12 further complicates the analyses and\nsubsequent interpretations.

In this work we obtain the basic properties of its dominant old\nstellar population. Firstly, we derive its structural properties by\nconstructing a stellar surface density map of the central 1000\" using\nextinction corrected star counts from VISTA, WFC3/IR and VLT/NACO data. We can\ndescribe the profile with a two-component model. The inner, slightly flattened\n(q=0.80+/-0.04) component is the nuclear cluster, while the outer component\ncorresponds to the stellar component of the circumnuclear zone. We measure for\nthe nuclear cluster a half-light radius of 178+/-51\"~7+/-2 pc and a luminosity\nof M_Ks=-16.0+/-0.5. Secondly, we enlarge the range over which detailed\ndynamics are available from 1 pc to 4 pc. We obtain more than 10000 individual\nproper motions from NACO data, and more than 2500 radial velocities from\nVLT/SINFONI data. We determine the cluster mass by means of isotropic spherical\nJeans modeling. We fix the distance to the Galactic Center and the mass of the\nsupermassive black hole. We model the cluster either with a constant mass to\nlight ratio or with a power law mass model. For the latter we obtain a slope of\ndelta_M=1.18+/-0.06. Assuming spherical symmetry, we get a nuclear cluster mass\nwithin 100\" of M_100\"=6.09+/- 0.53_(fix_R_0) +/- 0.97_(R_0) * 10^6 M_sun for\nboth modeling approaches.

Many instances of\nsocial contagion can be modeled as an infection process where a specific state\n(adoption of product, fad, knowledge, behavior, etc.) spreads from individual\nto individual through links between them. In the meantime, other forms of\nsocial contagion may better be understood as a diffusion process where the\nstate of an individual tends to assimilate with the social norm (i.e., local\naverage state) within his/her neighborhood.\n  Unlike infection scenarios where influence is nonlinear, unidirectional,\nfast, and potentially disruptive, social diffusion is linear, bidirectional,\ngradual, and converging. The distance between an individual's state and his/her\nneighbors' average state always decreases, and thus a homogeneous global state\nis guaranteed to be the network's stable equilibrium state in the long run.\nThis does not sound as intriguing or exciting as infection dynamics, which\nmight be why there are very few studies on mathematical models of social\ndiffusion processes.\n  Here, this study attempts to shed new light on an unrecognized characteristic\nof social diffusion, i.e., non-trivial drift it can cause to the network's\nglobal average state. Although somewhat counterintuitive, such global drift is\nindeed possible because, unlike physical diffusion processes, social diffusion\nprocesses are not conservational. In what follows, a mathematical model of\nsocial diffusion will be presented to explain the mechanism of this phenomenon,\nand some possible collective actions for influencing the direction of global\ndrift will be proposed.

We here explore the yet unknown origin for this\nuniversality. First, we investigate which region of the neutron star's interior\nand of the equation of state is most responsible for the universality. We find\nthat the universal relation between the moment of inertia and the quadrupole\nmoment is dominated by the star's outer-core, a shell of width (50-95)% of the\ntotal radius, which corresponds to the density range\n$(10^{14}$-$10^{15})$g/cm$^3$. Second, we study the impact on the universality\nof approximating stellar isodensity contours as self-similar ellipsoids. An\nanalytical calculation in the Newtonian limit reveals that the shape of the\nellipsoids does not affect the universal relations, but relaxing the\nself-similarity assumption can completely destroy it. Third, we investigate the\neccentricity profiles of rotating relativistic stars and find that the\nellipticity is roughly constant, with variations of roughly (20-30)% in the\nregion that matters to the universal relations. Fourth, we repeat the above\nanalysis for non-compact, regular stars and find that the ellipticity is not\nconstant, with variations that easily exceed 100% and universality is lost.\nThese findings suggest that universality arises as an emergent approximate\nsymmetry: as one flows in the stellar-structure phase space from non-compact\nstar region to the relativistic star region, the eccentricity variation inside\nstars decreases, leading to approximate self-similarity in their isodensity\ncontours, which then leads to the universal behavior observed in their exterior\nmultipole moments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 02:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 17:49:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-25"}

We used a master equation approach and a related\nstatistical mechanics model. The linear asphaltene nanoaggregates behave as a\nrigid linear chain. The most complicated case where all aromatic molecules are\ncounted in a nanoaggregate is then discussed. The linear aggregates where all\naromatic molecules are counted seem to behave as a flexible linear chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 03:07:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 11:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

For such a cognitive network, there are two important and limited\nresources that should be distributed in a comprehensive manner, namely feedback\nbits and time duration. First, regarding the feedback bits, there are two\ncomponents: sensing component (used to convey various users' sensing results)\nand accessing component (used to feedback channel state information). A large\nsensing component can support more users to perform cooperative sensing, which\nresults in high sensing precision. However, a large accessing component is\npreferred as well, as it has a direct impact on the performance in the\nmultiuser cognitive network when multi-antenna technique, such as zero-forcing\nbeamforming (ZFBF), is utilized. Second, the tradeoff of sensing and accessing\nduration in a transmission interval needs to be determined, so that the sum\ntransmission rate is optimized while satisfying the interference constraint. In\naddition, the above two resources are interrelated and inversive under some\nconditions. Specifically, sensing time can be saved by utilizing more sensing\nfeedback bits for a given performance objective. Hence, the resources should be\nallocation in a jointly manner. Based on the joint optimization framework and\nthe intrinsic relationship between the two resources, we propose two joint\nresource allocation schemes by maximizing the average sum transmission rate in\na multiuser multi-antenna cognitive network. Simulation results show that, by\nadopting the joint resource allocation schemes, obvious performance gain can be\nobtained over the traditional fixed strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 07:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-01"}

An appealing option is that hydrogen-deficient W-R\nstars are the progenitors of some H-poor supernova (SN) explosions of Types\nIIb, Ib, and Ic. A blue object, having luminosity and colors consistent with\nthose of some W-R stars, has been recently identified at the location of a\nSN~Ib in pre-explosion images but has not yet been conclusively determined to\nhave been the progenitor. Similar previous works have so far only resulted in\nnondetections. Comparison of early photometric observations of Type Ic\nsupernovae with theoretical models suggests that the progenitor stars had radii\n<10^12 cm, as expected for some W-R stars. However, the hallmark signature of\nW-R stars, their emission-line spectra, cannot be probed by such studies. Here,\nwe report the detection of strong emission lines in an early-time spectrum of\nSN 2013cu (iPTF13ast; Type IIb) obtained ~15.5 hr after explosion (\"flash\nspectroscopy\").

Building upon\nXVIII century Condorcet theory, whose idea was to maximize total voter\nsatisfaction, we propose here the addition of a new basic principle (dimension)\nto guide the selection: satisfaction should be distributed among voters as\nequally as possible. With this new criterion we identify an optimal set of\nrankings. They range from the Condorcet solution to the one which is the most\negalitarian with respect to the voters. We show that highly egalitarian\nrankings have the important property to be more stable with respect to\nfluctuations and that classical consensus rankings (Copeland, Tideman, Schulze)\noften turn out to be non optimal. The new dimension we have introduced\nprovides, when used together with that of Condorcet, a clear classification of\nall the possible rankings. By increasing awareness in selecting a consensus\nranking our method may lead to social choices which are more egalitarian\ncompared to those achieved by presently available voting systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 09:21:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 13:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

This is not\ntrue for approaches based on conditional independence tests, called\nconstraint-based learning algorithms. The only optimisation in widespread use,\nbacktracking, leverages the symmetries implied by the definitions of\nneighbourhood and Markov blanket.\n  In this paper we illustrate how backtracking is implemented in recent\nversions of the bnlearn R package, and how it degrades the stability of\nBayesian network structure learning for little gain in terms of speed. As an\nalternative, we describe a software architecture and framework that can be used\nto parallelise constraint-based structure learning algorithms (also implemented\nin bnlearn) and we demonstrate its performance using four reference networks\nand two real-world data sets from genetics and systems biology.

Our analysis\nshows that the dust-to-gas gradient in M31 is steeper than the metallicity\ngradient, suggesting interstellar dust growth is (or has been) important in\nM31.

The factorial hidden Markov model (FHMM) is a natural model to fit\nthis data. We enhance this generic model by introducing two constraints on the\nstate sequence of the FHMM. The first is to use a non-homogeneous Markov chain,\nmodelling how appliance usage varies over the day, and the other is to enforce\nthat at most one chain changes state at each time step.

In\nthis new setting, the IFNHMM outperforms the FHMM in terms of recovering the\nenergy used by the component appliances, due to that stronger constraints have\nbeen imposed on the states of the hidden Markov chains.

In a model with\ncontinuous space and time we find that if two particles arrive symmetrically in\na plane at a large angle, then (i) radial repulsion and (ii) linear\nself-propelling toward a fixed preferred speed are sufficient for them to\ndepart at a smaller angle. For this local gain of momentum explicit velocity\nalignment is not necessary, nor are adhesion/attraction, inelasticity or\nanisotropy of the particles, or nonlinear drag. With many particles obeying\nthese microscopic rules of motion we find that their spatial confinement to a\nsquare with periodic boundaries (which is an indirect form of attraction) leads\nto stable macroscopic ordering. After varying the density of particles at\nconstant system size and varying the size of the system with constant particle\ndensity we predict that in the infinite system size (or density) limit the\nhysteresis loop disappears and the transition becomes continuous. We note that\nanimals, humans, drones, etc. tend to move asynchronously and are often more\nresponsive to motion than positions. Thus, for them velocity-based continuous\nmodels can provide higher precision than coordinate-based models. An additional\ncharacteristic and realistic feature of the model is that convergence to the\nordered state is fastest at a finite density, which is in contrast to models\napplying (discontinuous) explicit velocity alignments and discretized time.

Our goal here is to\nbring this idea to address a challenging problem in statistics, \\emph{i.e.}\nfinding the oracle estimator which is unbiased and sign-consistent using\ndynamics. We call our dynamics \\emph{Bregman ISS} and \\emph{Linearized Bregman\nISS}. A well-known shortcoming of LASSO and any convex regularization\napproaches lies in the bias of estimators. However, we show that under proper\nconditions, there exists a bias-free and sign-consistent point on the solution\npaths of such dynamics, which corresponds to a signal that is the unbiased\nestimate of the true signal and whose entries have the same signs as those of\nthe true signs, \\emph{i.e.} the oracle estimator. Therefore, their solution\npaths are regularization paths better than the LASSO regularization path, since\nthe points on the latter path are biased when sign-consistency is reached. We\nalso show how to efficiently compute their solution paths in both continuous\nand discretized settings: the full solution paths can be exactly computed piece\nby piece, and a discretization leads to \\emph{Linearized Bregman iteration},\nwhich is a simple iterative thresholding rule and easy to parallelize.\nTheoretical guarantees such as sign-consistency and minimax optimal $l_2$-error\nbounds are established in both continuous and discrete settings for specific\npoints on the paths.

Three main modulating\nfactors affecting the optical response are identified: the near-field\ndistribution at the wavelength of the fundamental harmonic, how SH light\ncouples to the diffraction orders of the lattice, and its propagation\nproperties inside the holes. It is shown that light generated at the second\nharmonic can excite electromagnetic modes otherwise inaccessible in the linear\nregime under normal incidence illumination. It is demonstrated that the\nemission of SH radiation is only allowed along off-normal paths precisely due\nto that symmetry. Two different regimes are studied in the context of\nextraordinary optical transmission, where enhanced linear transmission either\noccurs through localized electromagnetic modes or is aided by surface plasmon\npolaritons (SPPs). While localized resonances in metallic hole arrays have been\npreviously investigated, the role played by SPPs in SH generation has not been\naddressed so far. In general, good agreement is found between our calculations\n(based on the finite difference time domain method) and the experimental\nresults on localized resonances, even though no free fitting parameters were\nused in describing the materials. It is found that SH emission is strongly\nmodulated by enhanced fields at the fundamental wavelength (either localized or\nsurface plasmon modes) on the glass metal interface. This is so in the\ntransmission side but also in reflection, where emission can only be explained\nby an efficient tunneling of SH photons through the holes from the output to\nthe input side. Finally, the existence of a dark SPP at the fundamental field\nis identified through a noninvasive method for the first time, by analyzing the\nefficiency and far-field pattern distribution in transmission at the second\nharmonic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 14:05:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 15:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-08"}

The\nmethod is based on the Abbe value, that estimates the smoothness of a light\ncurve, and on a newly introduced value called the excess Abbe that estimates\nthe regularity of the light curve variability pattern over the duration of the\nobservations. Based on simulated light curves, transients are shown to occupy a\nspecific region in the Abbe versus Excess Abbe diagram, distinct from sources\npresenting pulsating-like features in their light curves or having featureless\nlight curves.\n  The method is tested on real light curves taken from EROS-2 and OGLE-II\nsurveys in a 0.50deg x 0.17deg field of the sky in the LMC. The method\nidentifies 43 EROS-2 transient candidates out of a total of ~1300 variable\nstars, and 19 more OGLE-II candidates. The efficiency of the method is further\ntested by comparing the list of transient candidates with known Be stars in the\nliterature.

While load-balanced switches can achieve\nsuch scalability, they suffer from a fundamental packet reordering problem.\nExisting proposals either suffer from poor worst-case packet delays or require\nsophisticated matching mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a new family of\nstable load-balanced switches called \"Sprinklers\" that has comparable\nimplementation cost and performance as the baseline load-balanced switch, but\nyet can guarantee packet ordering. The main idea is to force all packets within\nthe same virtual output queue (VOQ) to traverse the same \"fat path\" through the\nswitch, so that packet reordering cannot occur. At the core of Sprinklers are\ntwo key innovations: a randomized way to determine the \"fat path\" for each VOQ,\nand a way to determine its \"fatness\" roughly in proportion to the rate of the\nVOQ. These innovations enable Sprinklers to achieve near-perfect load-balancing\nunder arbitrary admissible traffic. Proving this property rigorously using\nnovel worst-case large deviation techniques is another key contribution of this\nwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 01:31:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 22:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-21"}

In natural systems, insects, birds, fish and\nother large mammals function in larger units to increase the overall fitness of\nthe individuals. Their behavior is coordinated through local interactions to\nenhance mate selection, predator detection, migratory route identification and\nso forth [Andersson and Wallander 2003; Buhl et al. 2006; Nagy et al. 2010;\nPartridge 1982; Sumpter et al. 2008].

Depending upon the leadership model, leaders can use their\nexternal information either all the time or in response to local conditions\n[Couzin et al. 2005; Sun et al. 2013]. A covert leader is a leader that is\ntreated no differently than others in the swarm, so leaders and followers\nparticipate equally in whatever interaction model is used [Rossi et al. 2007].\nIn this study, we use theoretical information transfer as a means of analyzing\nswarm interactions to explore whether or not it is possible to distinguish\nbetween followers and leaders based on interactions within the swarm. We find\nthat covert leaders can be distinguished from followers in a swarm because they\nreceive less transfer entropy than followers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 02:18:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

Such a process is computationally intensive. Moreover, as the\nnetwork scales up, the computational load increases quadratically, or even\nexponentially. Unlike these man-made systems, most biological systems scale\nlinearly in complexity. Furthermore, the scale of a biological swarm can even\nenable collective intelligence. One example comes from observations of golden\nshiner fish. Golden shiners naturally prefer darkness and school together. Each\nindividual golden shiner does not know where the darkness is. Neither does it\nsense the light gradients in the environment. However, by moving together as a\nschool, they always end up in the shady area. We apply such collective\nintelligence learned from golden shiner fish to navigating robot swarms. Each\nindividual robot's dynamic is based on the gold shiners' movement strategy---a\nrandom walk with its speed modulated by the light intensity and its direction\naffected by its neighbors. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show\nthat our method 1) promises to navigate a robot swarm with little situational\nknowledge, 2) simplifies control and decision-making for each individual robot,\n3) requires minimal or even no information exchange within the swarm, and 4) is\nhighly distributed, adaptive, and robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 02:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

Automatic inference of the\nsocial structure in an animal group enables a number of important capabilities,\nincluding: 1) A verifiable measure of how the social structure is affected by\nan intervention such as a change in the environment, or the introduction of\nanother animal, and 2) A potentially significant reduction in person hours\nnormally used for assessing these changes. Social structure in a group is an\nimportant indicator of its members' relative level of access to resources and\nhas interesting implications for an individual's health and learning in groups.\nThere are two main quantitative criteria assessed in order to infer the social\nstructure; Time spent close to conspecifics, and displacements. An interaction\nmatrix is used to represent the total duration of events detected as grooming\nbehavior between any two monkeys.

Events that contribute to the adjacency matrix for this graph are\nwithdrawals or displacements where a lower ranked monkey moves away from a\nhigher ranked monkey. Displacements are one of the observable behaviors that\ncan act as a strong indication of tie-strength and dominance.

The extensive understanding of movement\nby single cells [R{\\o}rth 2011; Insall and Machesky 2011; Houk et al. 2012] is\ninsufficient to predict the behavior of cellular groups [Theveneau et al. 2013;\nTrepat, X. and Fredberg 2011], and identifying underlying rules of coordination\nin collective cell migration is still evasive. Few of the supposed benefits of\ncollective motion have ever been tested at the cellular scale. As an example,\nthough collective sensing allows for larger groups to exhibit greater accuracy\nin navigation [Simons 2004; Berdahl et al. 2013] and group taxis is possible\nthrough the leadership of only a few individuals [Couzin et al. 2005], such\neffects have never been investigated in collective cell migration. We will\ninvestigate collective motion and decision-making in a primitive multicellular\nanimal, Trichoplax adhaerens to understand how intercellular coordination\naffects animal behavior and how migration accuracy scales with cellular group\nsize.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 02:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-04"}

The method targets\nminimization of system free energy based on the electrically and\nflexoelectrically augmented Frank-Oseen free energy models. The Hessian,\nresulting from the linearization of the first-order optimality conditions, is\nshown to be invertible for both models when discretized by a mixed\nfinite-element method under certain assumptions. This implies that the\nintermediate discrete linearizations are well-posed. A coupled multigrid solver\nwith Vanka-type relaxation is proposed and numerically vetted for approximation\nof the solution to the linear systems arising in the linearizations. Two\nelectric model numerical experiments are performed with the proposed iterative\nsolver. The first compares the algorithm's solution of a classical Freedericksz\ntransition problem to the known analytical solution and demonstrates the\nconvergence of the algorithm to the true solution. The second experiment\ntargets a problem with more complicated boundary conditions, simulating a\nnano-patterned surface. In addition, numerical simulations incorporating these\nnano-patterned boundaries for a flexoelectric model are run with the iterative\nsolver. These simulations verify expected physical behavior predicted by a\nperturbation model. The algorithm accurately handles heterogeneous coefficients\nand efficiently resolves configurations resulting from classical and\ncomplicated boundary conditions relevant in ongoing research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jun 2014 19:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-14"}
