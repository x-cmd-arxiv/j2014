The research\nof induced radioactivity focuses on the photonuclear reaction, whose giant\nresonance response in the copper is ranging from 10 MeV to 28 MeV. The 200 MeV\nelectron linac of NSRL is one of the earliest high-energy electron linear\naccelerators in P. R. China. The electrons are accelerated to 200 MeV by five\nacceleration tubes and collimated by the scrapers made of copper.

In 2006, however, Martin and\nO'Bryant showed that the proportion of sum-dominant subsets of $\\{0,\\dots,n\\}$\nis bounded below by a positive constant as $n\\to\\infty$.

We\ngeneralize the integers in a growing interval to the lattice points in a\ndilating polytope. Specifically, let $P$ be a polytope in $\\mathbb{R}^D$ with\nvertices in $\\mathbb{Z}^D$, and let $\\rho_n^{s,d}$ now denote the proportion of\nsubsets of $L(nP)$ that are missing exactly $s$ sums in $L(nP)+L(nP)$ and\nexactly $2d$ differences in $L(nP)-L(nP)$.

We define\na geometric characteristic of polytopes called local point symmetry, and show\nthat $\\rho_n^{s,d}$ is bounded below by a positive constant as $n\\to\\infty$ if\nand only if $P$ is locally point symmetric. We further show that the proportion\nof subsets in $L(nP)$ that are missing exactly $s$ sums and at least $2d$\ndifferences remains positive in the limit, independent of the geometry of $P$.\nA direct corollary of these results is that if $P$ is additionally point\nsymmetric, the proportion of sum-dominant subsets of $L(nP)$ also remains\npositive in the limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 02:28:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 19:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-11"}

A delayed response of the K-band light curve after\nthe V-band light curve was found for all targets, and 49 measurements of lag\ntimes between the flux variation of the dust emission in the K band and that of\nthe optical continuum emission in the V band were obtained. The lag times\nstrongly correlated with the optical luminosity in the luminosity range of\nM_V=-16 to -22 mag, and the regression analysis was performed to obtain the\ncorrelation log $\\Delta t$ (days) = -2.11 -0.2 M_V assuming $\\Delta t \\propto\nL^{0.5}$, which was theoretically expected. We discuss the possible origins of\nthe intrinsic scatter of the dust lag-luminosity correlation, which was\nestimated to be about 0.13 dex, and we find that the difference of internal\nextinction and delayed response of changes in lag times to the flux variations\ncould have partly contributed to intrinsic scatter.

Finally, we compare the dust reverberation\nradius with the near-infrared interferometric radius of the dust torus and the\nreverberation radius of broad Balmer emission lines. The interferometric radius\nin the K band was found to be systematically larger than the dust reverberation\nradius in the same band by about a factor of two, which could be interpreted by\nthe difference between the flux-weighted radius and the response-weighted\nradius of the innermost dust torus. The reverberation radius of the broad\nBalmer emission lines was found to be systematically smaller than the dust\nreverberation radius by about a factor of 4-5, which strongly supports the\nunified scheme of the Seyfert type of active galactic nuclei.

The method is applied to a model perfect\ncrystalline solid, to a crystalline solid contaminated with topological\ndefects, and to a generic glass. The highest yield stress belongs to the\ncrystal, the lowest to the crystal with a few defects, with the glass in\nbetween.

A family of\nmetrics based on the structural hamming distance is defined for the space of\nDAGs (of a given node set) and is used for aggregation. Under the\nhigh-dimensional-low-sample size setting, the graph learned on one data set\noften has excessive number of false positive edges due to over-fitting of the\nnoise. Aggregation overcomes over-fitting through variance reduction and thus\ngreatly reduces false positives.

However, the presence of lattice defects, unavoidable in\nsheets obtained by scalable routes, might degrade its mechanical properties.\nHere we report a systematic study on the elastic modulus and strength of\ngraphene with controlled density of defects. Counter intuitively, the in-plane\nYoung modulus increases with increasing defect density up to almost twice the\ninitial value for vacancy content of ~0.2%, turning it into the stiffest\nmaterial ever reported. For higher density of vacancies, elastic modulus\ndecreases with defect inclusion.

Using the unitarity relation in\ncombination with experimental data about the elastic scattering in the\ndiffraction cone, it is shown how the shape and the darkness of the interaction\nregion of colliding protons change with increase of their energies. In\nparticular, the collisions become fully absorptive at small impact parameters\nat LHC energies that results in some special features of inelastic processes as\nwell. Possible evolution of the shape from the dark core at the LHC to the\nfully transparent one is discussed that implies the terminology of the black\ndisk would be replaced by the black torus. The parameter which determines the\nopacity of central collisions also plays a crucial role in the behavior of the\ndifferential cross section of elastic scattering outside the diffraction cone\nwhere the predictions of all phenomenological models failed at LHC energies.\nThe role of the ratio of real to imaginary part of the elastic scattering\namplitude at non-forward scattering becomes decisive there as seen from the\nunitarity condition. The obtained results allow to estimate this ratio outside\nthe diffraction cone for the first time by comparison with experiment at LHC\nenergies which happens to be drastically different from its values measured at\nforward scattering. Moreover, the behaviors of the real and imaginary parts\nseparately differ in different phenomeno- logical models and in the approach\nbased on the unitarity condition. This problem is still waiting for its\nresolution. All the conclusions are only obtained in the framework of the\nindubitable unitarity condition using experimental data about the elastic\nscattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 12:11:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 08:22:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 18:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-25"}

For this reason, we constructed a grid of stellar models including\ndiffusion and rotation-induced extra-mixing with given ranges of input\nparameters (i.e. mass, metallicity, and initial rotation rate). In addition to\nthe commonly used observational constraints such as the effective temperature\nT_{eff}, luminosity L and metallicity [Fe/H], we added two observational\nconstraints, the lithium abundance log N (Li) and the rotational period\nP_{rot}. These two additional observed parameters can make further constrains\non the model due to their correlations with mass, age and other stellar\nproperties. Hence, our estimations of fundamental parameters for these EH stars\nand their planets are with higher precision than previous works. Therefore, the\ncombination of rotational period and lithium help us to obtain more accurate\nparameters for stars, leading to an improvement of the knowledge of the\nphysical state about the EH stars and their planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 13:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The protein is structurally organised into two globular lobes,\njoined by a flexible linker. Calcium modulates calmodulin activity by favoring\na conformational transition of each lobe from a closed conformation to an open\nconformation. Most targets have a strong preference for one conformation over\nthe other, and depending on the free calcium concentration in a cell,\nparticular sets of targets will preferentially interact with calmodulin. In\nturn, targets can increase or decrease the calcium affinity of the calmodulin\nmolecules to which they bind. Interestingly, experiments with the tryptic\nfragments showed that most targets have a much lower affinity for the N-lobe\nthan for the C-lobe. Hence, the latter predominates in the formation of most\ncalmodulin-target complexes. We showed that a relatively simple allosteric\nmechanism, based the classic MWC model, can capture the observed modulation of\nboth the isolated C-lobe, and intact calmodulin, by individual targets.\nMoreover, our model can be naturally extended to study how the calcium affinity\nof a single pool of calmodulin is modulated by a mixture of competing targets\nin vivo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 14:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In particular, large gains in area- and power\nefficiency could be achieved by dedicated analog realizations of approximate\ncomputing engines. In this work, we explore the use of memristor networks for\nanalog approximate computation, based on a machine learning framework called\nreservoir computing. Most experimental investigations on the dynamics of\nmemristors focus on their nonvolatile behavior. Hence, the volatility that is\npresent in the developed technologies is usually unwanted and it is not\nincluded in simulation models. In contrast, in reservoir computing, volatility\nis not only desirable but necessary. Therefore, in this work, we propose two\ndifferent ways to incorporate it into memristor simulation models. The first is\nan extension of Strukov's model and the second is an equivalent Wiener model\napproximation. We analyze and compare the dynamical properties of these models\nand discuss their implications for the memory and the nonlinear processing\ncapacity of memristor networks. Our results indicate that device variability,\nincreasingly causing problems in traditional computer design, is an asset in\nthe context of reservoir computing. We conclude that, although both models\ncould lead to useful memristor based reservoir computing systems, their\ncomputational performance will differ. Therefore, experimental modeling\nresearch is required for the development of accurate volatile memristor models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 15:16:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 14:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-17"}

Furthermore, a modified\nformulation of the external boundary force is introduced that leads to a more\naccurate no-slip boundary condition. The derivation also reveals that the\ncoupling methods can be cast into a unified form, and that the immersed\nboundary method can be interpreted as the limit of force coupling for vanishing\nparticle mass. In practice, the ratio between fluid and particle mass\ndetermines the strength of the force transfer in the coupling. The integration\nschemes formally improve the accuracy of first-order algorithms that are\ncommonly employed when coupling immersed objects to a lattice Boltzmann fluid.\nIt is anticipated that they will also lead to superior long-time stability in\nsimulations of complex fluids with multiple scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 15:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

While traditional\napproaches for fixed networks are more or less centralized, more complex\nmanagement strategies have been proposed for wireless networks, such as\nhierarchical, fully distributed and hybrid ones. The reason for the\nintroduction of new strategies is based on the dynamic and unpredictable nature\nof wireless networks and their (usually) limited resources, which do not\nsupport centralized management solutions.

Similarly, this can be thought as the maximum amount of information\nrequired to perfectly describe a given physical system down to its quantum\nlevel. If the energy and the region of space are finite then the number of\ninformation N required in describing the physical system is also finite. In\nthis short letter two information number bounds are derived and compared for\ntwo types of universe. First, a universe without a cosmological constant lamda\nand second a universe with a cosmological constant lamda are investigated. This\nis achieved with the derivation of two different relations that connect the\nHubble constant and cosmological constants to the number of information N. We\nfind that the number of information N involved in a the two universes are\nidentical or\n  N1=N2, and that the total mass of the universe scales as the square root of\nthe information number N, containing an information number N of the order of\n10E+122. Finally, we expressed Calogero quantization action as a function of\nthe number of information N. We also have found that in self gravitating\nsystems the number of information N in nats is the ratio of the total kinetic\nto total thermal energy of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 15:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-13"}

The corresponding masses are\n2.0x10E-62 kg and 2.3E+54 kg respectively, and in general can be obtained with\nthe help of a generic dimensional analysis, or from an analysis where the\ncosmological constant appears in a four dimensional space-time and as a result\nof a higher dimensional reduction. In this paper our goal is to establish a\nrelation for both quantum and gravitational mass as function of the information\nnumber bit N. For this reason, we first derive an expression for the\ncosmological constant as a function of information bit, since both masses\ndepend on it, and then various resulting relations are explored, in relation to\ninformation number of bits N. Fractional information bits imply no information\nextraction is possible. We see, that the order of magnitude of the various\nparameters as well as their ratios involve the large number 10E+122, that is\nproduced naturally from the fundamental parameters of modern cosmology.\nFinally, we propose that in a complete quantum gravity theory the idea of\ninformation the might have to be included, with the quantum bits of information\n(q-bits) as one of its fundamental parameters, resulting thus to a more\ncomplete understanding of the universe, its laws, and its evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 15:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-13"}

However, it is conceivable that, in the presence\nof an external magnetic field, spatial asymmetry perpendicular to the direction\nof propagation suffices to ensure rectification. This is the case of a\nnonlinear ring-shaped lattice with different upper and lower halves (diode),\nwhich is attached to two elastic chains (leads). The resulting device is mirror\nsymmetric with respect to the ring vertical axis, but mirror asymmetric with\nrespect to the chain direction. Wave propagation along the two diode paths can\nbe modeled for simplicity by a discrete Schr\\\"odinger equation with cubic\nnonlinearities.

The rapid development in quantum optics calls for\nelectromagnetic solutions that straddle quantum physics as well as classical\nphysics. The vector potential formulation is a good candidate to bridge these\ntwo regimes. Hence, there is a need to generalize this formulation to\ninhomogeneous media. A generalized gauge is suggested for solving\nelectromagnetic problems in inhomogenous media which can be extended to the\nanistropic case. The advantages of the resulting equations are their absence of\nlow-frequency catastrophe. Hence, usual differential equation solvers can be\nused to solve them over multi-scale and broad bandwidth. It is shown that the\ninterface boundary conditions from the resulting equations reduce to those of\nclassical Maxwell's equations. Also, classical Green's theorem can be extended\nto such a formulation, resulting in similar extinction theorem, and surface\nintegral equation formulation for surface scatterers.
