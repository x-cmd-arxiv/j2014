Although linear octrees, which store only\nleaf octants, have an underlying tree structure by definition, it is not often\nexploited in previously published mesh-related algorithms. This is because the\nbranches are not explicitly stored, and because the topological relationships\nin meshes, such as the adjacency between cells, introduce dependencies that do\nnot respect the octree hierarchy. In this work we combine hierarchical and\ntopological relationships between octree branches to design efficient recursive\nalgorithms.\n  We present three important algorithms with recursive implementations. The\nfirst is a parallel search for leaves matching any of a set of multiple search\ncriteria. The second is a ghost layer construction algorithm that handles\narbitrarily refined octrees that are not covered by previous algorithms, which\nrequire a 2:1 condition between neighboring leaves. The third is a universal\nmesh topology iterator. This iterator visits every cell in a domain partition,\nas well as every interface (face, edge and corner) between these cells. The\niterator calculates the local topological information for every interface that\nit visits, taking into account the nonconforming interfaces that increase the\ncomplexity of describing the local topology. To demonstrate the utility of the\ntopology iterator, we use it to compute the numbering and encoding of\nhigher-order $C^0$ nodal basis functions.\n  We analyze the complexity of the new recursive algorithms theoretically, and\nassess their performance, both in terms of single-processor efficiency and in\nterms of parallel scalability, demonstrating good weak and strong scaling up to\n458k cores of the JUQUEEN supercomputer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 May 2014 16:02:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 21:00:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 03:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-05"}

We find that a shift of -100% in the down-quark Yukawa Y_d would\ngenerically result in ds transitions in conflict with Kaon physics. This could\nalready be seen as evidence for a non-vanishing direct coupling of the down\nquark to the newly discovered Higgs boson. The non-observation of certain,\nalready well-constrained, processes is thus turned into a powerful indirect\nmeasure of physical parameters of the effective Standard-Model, which are so\nfar basically unconstrained from experiment and extremely challenging to access\nwith other methods.

However, such strategy\ndoes not consider the contextual evidences of a keypoint, a problem which would\nlead to the prevalence of false matches. To address this problem, this paper\ndefines \"true match\" as a pair of keypoints which are similar on three levels,\ni.e., local, regional, and global. Then, a principled probabilistic framework\nis established, which is capable of implicitly integrating discriminative cues\nfrom all these feature levels.\n  Specifically, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to extract\nfeatures from regional and global patches, leading to the so-called \"Deep\nEmbedding\" framework.

Therefore, to control this error, an enormous\nnumber of particles are required, which means a heavy computational burden that\nis often so great it is simply prohibitive.

Through a\nsuitable localisation operation, they prove that a modified particle filtering\nalgorithm can achieve an approximation error that is mostly independent of the\nproblem dimension.

This bias consequently varies\nthroughout field. In this work, a simple extension to the algorithm of\nRebeschini and van Handel is introduced which acts to average this bias term\nover each site in the field through a kind of spatial smoothing.

However, energy\nharvesting communication systems with multiple transmitters and multiple\nreceivers have not been considered yet. In this paper, the problem of\nbroadcasting in a communication system with multiple energy harvesting\ntransmitters and multiple receivers is studied. First, regarding the\ntransmitters as a 'hole transmitter' [1], the optimal total transmission power\nis obtained and the optimal power allocation policy in [2] is extended to our\nsystem setup, with the aim of minimizing the transmission completion time.\nThen, a simpler power allocation policy is developed to allocate the optimal\ntotal transmission power to the data transmissions. As transmitter switching\ncan provide flexibility and robustness to an energy harvesting communication\nsystem, especially when a transmitter is broken or the energy harvested by a\ntransmitter is insufficient, a transmitter switching policy is further\ndeveloped to choose a suitable transmitter to work whenever necessary. The\nresults show that the proposed power allocation policy performs close to the\noptimal one and outperforms some heuristic ones in terms of transmission\ncompletion time. Besides, the proposed transmitter switching policy outperforms\nsome heuristic ones in terms of number of switches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jun 2014 08:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-03"}

Depending on whether the interatomic interactions are short- or\nlong-range, the low-temperature stability diagrams in terms of\ninteraction-energy parameters are obtained. The dominance of intersublattice\ninteractions in competition with intrasublattice ones results in a nonmonotony\nof ordering-process kinetics. Spatial correlations of impurities do not affect\nthe electronic conductivity of graphene for the most important\nexperimentally-relevant cases of point defects, neutral adatoms and screened\ncharged impurities, while atomic ordering can give rise in the conductivity up\nto tens times for weak and strong short-range potentials. There is no ordering\neffect manifestation for long-range potentials. The anisotropy of the\nconductivity along and across the line defects is revealed and gives rise in\nthe conductivity of graphene with correlated line defects as compared with the\ncase of random ones. Simultaneously correlated (and/or ordered) point and line\ndefects in graphene can give rise in the conductivity up to hundreds times vs.\ntheir random distribution. On an example of different B or N doping\nconfigurations in graphene, results from the Kubo-Greenwood approach are\ncompared with those obtained from DFT method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jun 2014 11:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-04"}
