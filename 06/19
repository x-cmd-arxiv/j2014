These objects generate, through\nseveral current systems, perturbations in the streaming magnetic field leading\nto its draping around the obstacle's effective conducting surface. Recent\nobservational results suggest that several properties associated with the\nmagnetic field draping, such as the location of the polarity reversal layer of\nthe induced magnetotail, are affected by variations in the conditions of the\nstreaming magnetic field. To improve our understanding of these phenomena, we\nperform a characterization of several magnetic field draping signatures by\nanalytically solving an ideal problem in which a perfectly conducting\nmagnetized plasma (with frozen-in magnetic field conditions) flows around a\nspherical body for various orientations of the streaming magnetic field. In\nparticular, we compute the shift of the inverse polarity reversal layer as the\norientation of the background magnetic field is changed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 16:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This\ninvolves a clinician estimating the age of a patient from a radiograph of the\nnon-dominant hand.\n  Our approach to automated bone age assessment is to modularise the algorithm\ninto the following three stages: segment and verify hand outline; segment and\nverify bones; use the bone outlines to construct models of age. In this paper\nwe address the final question: given outlines of bones, can we learn how to\npredict the bone age of the patient? We examine two alternative approaches.\nFirstly, we attempt to train classifiers on individual bones to predict the\nbone stage categories commonly used in bone ageing. Secondly, we construct\nregression models to directly predict patient age.\n  We demonstrate that models built on summary features of the bone outline\nperform better than those built using the one dimensional representation of the\noutline, and also do at least as well as other automated systems. We show that\nmodels constructed on just three bones are as accurate at predicting age as\nexpert human assessors using the standard technique. We also demonstrate the\nutility of the model by quantifying the importance of ethnicity and sex on age\ndevelopment. Our conclusion is that the feature based system of separating the\nimage processing from the age modelling is the best approach for automated bone\nageing, since it offers flexibility and transparency and produces accurate\nestimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 16:13:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-19"}

While that is\na substantial improvement, our analysis reveals that the existing densification\nscheme is sub-optimal. In particular, there is no enough randomness in that\nprocedure, which affects its accuracy on very sparse datasets.\n  In this paper, we provide a new densification procedure which is provably\nbetter than the existing scheme. This improvement is more significant for very\nsparse datasets which are common over the web.

The best studied is incomplete\nlineage sorting, which is commonly modeled by the coalescent process. Numerous\nmethods based on the coalescent process have been proposed for estimation of\nthe phylogenetic species tree given DNA sequence data. However, use of these\nmethods assumes that the phylogenetic species tree can be identified from DNA\nsequence data at the leaves of the tree, although this has not been formally\nestablished. We prove that the unrooted topology of the n-leaf phylogenetic\nspecies tree is generically identifiable given observed data at the leaves of\nthe tree that are assumed to have arisen from the coalescent process under a\ntime-reversible substitution process with the possibility of site-specific rate\nvariation modeled by the discrete gamma distribution and a proportion of\ninvariable sites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 17:53:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2015 21:18:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-07"}

The\nprevious three chapters emphasized the theory of wind mass loss, eruptions, and\ncore collapse physics, but here we emphasize mainly the observational\nproperties of the resulting death throes. Mass loss through winds, eruptions,\nand interacting binaries largely determines the wide variety of different types\nof supernovae that are observed, as well as the circumstellar environments into\nwhich the supernova blast waves expand. Connecting these observed properties of\nthe explosions to the initial masses of their progenitor stars is, however, an\nenduring challenge and is especially difficult for very massive stars.\nSuperluminous supernovae, pair instability supernovae, gamma ray bursts, and\n\"failed\" supernovae are all end fates that have been proposed for very massive\nstars, but the range of initial masses or other conditions leading to each of\nthese (if they actually occur) are still very certain. Extrapolating to infer\nthe role of very massive stars in the early universe is essentially\nunencumbered by observational constraints and still quite dicey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 18:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Gathering\na rich, multi-wavelength dataset, we aim to confirm the lensing hypothesis and\nmodel the background source's morphology and dynamics, as well as to provide a\nfull physical characterisation. Methods: Multi-wavelength high-resolution data\nis utilised to assess the nature of the system. A lensing-analysis algorithm\nwhich simultaneously fits different wavebands is adopted to characterise the\nlens. The background galaxy dynamical information is studied by reconstructing\nthe 3-D source-plane of the ALMA CO(J:4-3) transition. Near-IR imaging from HST\nand Keck-AO allows to constrain rest-frame optical photometry independently for\nthe foreground and background systems. Physical parameters (such as stellar and\ndust masses) are estimated via modelling of the spectral energy distribution\ntaking into account source blending, foreground obscuration, and differential\nmagnification. Results: The system comprises a foreground edge-on disk galaxy\n(at z_sp=0.218) with an almost complete Einstein ring around it. The background\nsource (at z_sp=1.027) is magnified by a factor of ~8-10 depending on\nwavelength. It is comprised of two components and a tens of kpc long tidal tail\nresembling the Antennae merger. As a whole, the system is a massive stellar\nsystem (1.32[-0.41,+0.63] x1E11 Mo) forming stars at a rate of 394+-90 Mo/yr,\nand has a significant gas reservoir M_ISM = 4.6+-1.7 x1E10 Mo.

The dynamical mass of one of the components is\nestimated to be 5.8+-1.7 x1E10 Mo, and, together with the photometric total\nmass estimate, it implies that H1429-0028 is a major merger system\n(1:2.8[-1.5,+1.8]).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

The implication for fundamental\nphysics is that exotic dark matter particles do not exist and that consequently\neffective gravitational physics on the scales of galaxies and beyond ought to\nbe non-Newtonian/non-Einsteinian. The data imply that scale-invariant dynamics,\nas discovered by Milgrom, is an excellent description of galaxies in the\nweak-field regime. Observations of stellar populations in galaxies suggest the\ngalaxy-wide IMF, the IGIMF, to vary with star formation rate and that\nstochastic descriptions of star formation are inconsistent with the data. A\nconsequence of this understanding of galactic astrophysics is that most dwarf\nsatellite galaxies are formed as tidal dwarf galaxies in galaxy-galaxy\nencounters, that they follow the mass-metallicity relation, that galactic\nmergers are rare, that galaxies immersed in external potentials are physically\nlarger than isolated galaxies and that star-forming galaxies form a main\nsequence.

So far $\\mu_p$ has only been measured indirectly, analysing the\nspectrum of an atomic hydrogen maser in a magnetic field. Here, we report the\ndirect high-precision measurement of the magnetic moment of a single proton\nusing the double Penning-trap technique. We drive proton-spin quantum jumps by\na magnetic radio-frequency field in a Penning trap with a homogeneous magnetic\nfield. The induced spin-transitions are detected in a second trap with a strong\nsuperimposed magnetic inhomogeneity. This enables the measurement of the\nspin-flip probability as a function of the drive frequency. In each measurement\nthe proton's cyclotron frequency is used to determine the magnetic field of the\ntrap.

It\nis evident that the opposition effect for Vesta makes a contribution to not\nonly the shadow-hiding effect, but also the coherent backscattering effect that\nappears from ca. $1\\timeform{D}$. The amplitude of the coherent backscatter\nopposition effect for Vesta increases with a brightening of reflectance. By\ncomparison with other solar system bodies, we suggest that multiple-scattering\non an optically active scale may contribute to the amplitude of the coherent\nbackscatter opposition effect ($B_{C0}$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 23:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This phase\nis known to occur between the photosphere and low corona, where many models\nintroduce an instability and/or magnetic reconnection that triggers a CME,\noften with associated flaring activity. To this end, it is important to obtain\na variety of observations of the low corona in order to build as clear a\npicture as possible of the dynamics that occur therein. Here, we combine the\nEUV imagery of the SWAP instrument on board PROBA2 with the white-light imagery\nof the ground-based Mk4 coronameter at MLSO in order to bridge the\nobservational gap that exists between the disk imagery of AIA on board SDO and\nthe coronal imagery of LASCO on board SOHO. Methods of multiscale image\nanalysis were applied to the observations to better reveal the coronal signal\nwhile suppressing noise and other features. This allowed an investigation into\nthe initiation phase of a CME that was driven by a rising flux rope structure\nfrom a \"two-stage\" flaring active region underlying an extended helmet\nstreamer. It was found that the initial outward motion of the erupting loop\nsystem in the EUV observations coincided with the first X-ray flare peak, and\nled to a plasma pile-up of the white-light CME core material. The characterized\nCME core then underwent a strong jerk in its motion, as the early acceleration\nincreased abruptly, simultaneous with the second X-ray flare peak. The overall\nsystem expanded into the helmet streamer to become the larger CME structure\nobserved in the LASCO coronagraph images, which later became concave-outward in\nshape. Theoretical models for the event are discussed in light of these unique\nobservations, and it is concluded that the formation of either a kink-unstable\nor torus-unstable flux rope may be the likeliest scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 00:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

If the loop is a plane curve the minimal\nsurface lives in hyperbolic space $H_3$ (or equivalently Euclidean AdS$_3$\nspace). We argue that finding the area of such extremal surface can be easily\ndone if we solve the following problem: given two real periodic functions\n$V_{0,1}(s)$, $V_{0,1}(s+2\\pi)=V_{0,1}(s)$, a third periodic function $V_2(s)$\nis to be found such that all solutions to the equation $- \\phi\"(s) +\n\\big[V_0+{1\\over 2} (\\lambda+{1 \\over \\lambda}) V_1 + {i\\over 2} (\\lambda-{1\n\\over \\lambda}) V_2\\big] \\phi(s)=0$ are anti-periodic in $s\\in[0,2\\pi]$ for any\nvalue of $\\lambda$.

The worst bias error in a maximum likelihood\nestimate caused by an interference signal within a given small power is\nderived. A novel inequality condition with a clock bias error and magnification\ncoefficients that upper-bounds a horizontal position error is presented.\nRobustness of the inequality condition is numerically shown based on actual\nconfigurations of satellites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 06:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Understanding the variability of those deep\ncurrents is crucial to improve the forecast of geomagnetic field variations,\nwhich affect human spacial and aeronautic activities. Moreover, it may provide\nrelevant information on the core dynamics. The main goal of this study is to\nextract and characterize the leading variability modes of core flows over\ncentennial periods, and to assess their statistical robustness. To this end, we\nuse flows that we invert from two geomagnetic field models (gufm1 and COV-OBS),\nand apply Principal Component Analysis and Singular Value Decomposition of\ncoupled fields. The quasi geostrophic (QG) flows inverted from both geomagnetic\nfield models show similar features. However, COV-OBS has a less energetic mean\nand larger time variability. The statistical significance of flow components is\ntested from analyses performed on subareas of the whole domain. Bootstrapping\nmethods are also used to extract significant flow features required by both\ngufm1 and COV-OBS. Three main empirical circulation modes emerge,\nsimultaneously constrained by both geomagnetic field models and expected to be\nrobust against the particular a priori used to build them (large scale QG\ndynamics). Mode 1 exhibits three large vortices at medium/high latitudes, with\nopposite circulation under the Atlantic and the Pacific hemispheres. Mode 2\ninterestingly accounts for most of the variations of the Earth's core angular\nmomentum. In this mode, the regions close to the tangent cylinder and to the\nequator are correlated, and oscillate with a period between 80 and 90 years.\nEach of these two modes is energetic enough to alter the mean flow, sometimes\nreinforcing the eccentric gyre, and other times breaking it up into smaller\ncirculations. The three main circulation modes added together to the mean flow\naccount for about 70% of the flows variability, 90% of the root mean square\ntotal velocities, and 95% of the secular variation induced by the total flows.\nDirect physical interpretation of the computed modes is not straightforward.\nNonethe-less, similarities found between the two first modes and time/spatial\nfeatures identified in different studies of core dynamics, suggest that our\napproach can help to pinpoint the relevant physical processes inside the core\non centennial timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 08:04:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 09:22:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

At sufficiently large metallic loadings, granular metals behave as\npercolating systems with a well-defined critical concentration above which\nmacroscopic clusters of physically connected conductive particles span the\nentire sample. Below the critical loading, granular metal films are in the\ndielectric regime, where current can flow throughout the composite only via\nhopping or tunneling processes between isolated nanosized particles or\nclusters. In this case transport is intrinsically non-percolative in the sense\nthat no critical concentration can be identified for the onset of transport.

While the principle of this approach is well\nunderstood, its practical application on commercial material to be used in\npower application is still far to be implemented due to manufacturing and\ntechnological constraints. Recent advances in tape quality and striation\ntechnology are now enabling systematic investigations of the influence of the\nnumber of filaments on AC loss reduction with a consistency that was not\navailable in the past. In this work we demonstrate the technological\nfeasibility of reducing the magnetization losses of commercially available CC\nby striating them into a high number of filaments (up to 120). The loss\nreduction exceeds one order of magnitude and does not come at the expense of\ncurrent-carrying capability: samples with 10 and 20 filaments are unaffected by\nthe striation process, while samples with 80 and 120 filaments still retain 80\nand 70% of the current-carrying potential, respectively. We also investigate\nthe transverse resistivity in order to understand the paths followed by the\ncoupling currents: we found that the coupling current prevalently flows in the\nmetallic substrate, rather than in and out of the filaments. Finally, we use\noxidation as a method to reduce the coupling currents and losses. The\ncontribution of this work is three-fold: 1) It describes the know-how to\nproduce a large number of high quality striations in commercially available\nCCs, greatly reducing their losses without extensively degrading their\ntransport properties; 2) It provides a comprehensive characterization of said\nsamples (e.g. measurements in a wide frequency range, transverse resistance\nprofiles, influence of oxidation on DC and AC behavior); 3) It provides new\ninsight on the patterns of the coupling currents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 09:52:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 13:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-30"}

It\nmight challenge the standard two-component glitch model, because large\nfractions of superfluid neutrons are thought to be entrained in the lattices of\nthe crust part, then there is not enough superfluid neutrons to trigger the\nlarge glitches in Vela-like pulsars. But the amount of entrainment which could\neffectively constrain the fractional moment of inertia of a pulsar, is very\nuncertain. In order to examine the importance of this parameter on the inner\nstructures of neutron stars, we relax the \"glitch crisis\" argument, employ a\nset of most developed equations of state derived within microscopic many-body\napproaches that could fulfill the recent 2-solar-mass constraint, and evaluate\ntheir predictions for the fractional moment of inertia with two extremes of\ncrustal entrainment. We find a final determination of the amount of entrainment\ncould be closely related to the type of neutron star. If a large enough\nfraction of neutrons are entrained, a Vela-like pulsar could not be a hybrid\nstar, namely no free quarks would be present in its core.

The archetypal active galaxy\nNGC 5548 has been studied for decades, and high-resolution X-ray and UV\nobservations have previously shown a persistent ionized outflow. An observing\ncampaign in 2013 with six space observatories shows the nucleus to be obscured\nby a long-lasting, clumpy stream of ionized gas never seen before. It blocks\n90% of the soft X-ray emission and causes simultaneous deep, broad UV\nabsorption troughs. The outflow velocities of this gas are up to five times\nfaster than those in the persistent outflow, and at a distance of only a few\nlight days from the nucleus, it may likely originate from the accretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 11:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-20"}

However, given the strain that such a network can\nexert on the power grid, and the mobility of loads represented by electric\nvehicles, operating it efficiently is a challenging problem. In this paper, we\nexamine a network of charging stations equipped with an energy storage device\nand propose a scheme that allocates power to them from the grid, as well as\nroutes customers. We examine three scenarios, gradually increasing their\ncomplexity. In the first one, all stations have identical charging capabilities\nand energy storage devices, draw constant power from the grid and no routing\ndecisions of customers are considered. It represents the current state of\naffairs and serves as a baseline for evaluating the performance of the proposed\nscheme. In the second scenario, power to the stations is allocated in an\noptimal manner from the grid and in addition a certain percentage of customers\ncan be routed to nearby stations. In the final scenario, optimal allocation of\nboth power from the grid and customers to stations is considered. The three\nscenarios are evaluated using real traffic traces corresponding to weekday rush\nhour from a large metropolitan area in the US. The results indicate that the\nproposed scheme offers substantial improvements of performance compared to the\ncurrent mode of operation; namely, more customers can be served with the same\namount of power, thus enabling the station operators to increase their\nprofitability. Further, the scheme provides guarantees to customers in terms of\nthe probability of being blocked by the closest charging station. Overall, the\npaper addresses key issues related to the efficient operation of a network of\ncharging stations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 12:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-20"}

In addition, they may represent either a\nthreat to humankind, or a repository of extraterrestrial resources for suitable\nspace-borne missions. Within this framework, the choice of next-generation\nmission targets and the characterisation of a potential threat to our planet\ndeserve special attention. To date, only a small part of the 11,000 discovered\nNEOs have been physically characterised. From ground and space-based\nobservations one can determine some basic physical properties of these objects\nusing visible and infrared spectroscopy. We present data for 13 objects\nobserved with different telescopes around the world (NASA-IRTF, ESO-NTT, TNG)\nin the 0.4 - 2.5 um spectral range, within the NEOSURFACE survey\n(http://www.oa-roma.inaf.it/planet/NEOSurface.html).

All of them are\ncharacterised by a delta-V (the change in velocity needed for transferring a\nspacecraft from low-Earth orbit to rendez-vous with NEOs) lower than 10.5 km/s,\nwell below the Solar System escape velocity (12.3 km/s).

The\nkey parameter of the model is the attack angle, which is related to the\ninclination of the magnetic field vector at the canopy height.

To shed light on this, we studied 172 stars belonging to the 5 SGBs\nthat we can identify in our photometry, in order to measure their [Fe/H]\ncontent as well as estimate their age dispersion and the age-metallicity\nrelation. The first important result is that all of these SGBs has a\ndistribution in metallicity with a spread that exceeds the observational errors\nand typically displays several peaks that indicate the presence of several\nsub-populations. We were able to identified at least 6 of them based on their\nmean [Fe/H] content. These metallicity-based sub-populations are seen to\nvarying extents in each of the 5 SGBs. Taking advantage of the age-sensitivity\nof the SGB we showed that, first of all, at least half of the sub-populations\nhave an age spread of at least 2 Gyrs. Then we obtained an age-metallicity\nrelation that is the most complete up to date for this cluster. The\ninterpretation of the age-metallicity relation is not straightforward, but it\nis possible that the cluster (or what we can call its progenitor) was initially\ncomposed of two populations having different metallicities. Because of their\nage, it is very unlikely that the most metal-rich derives from the most\nmetal-poor by some kind of chemical evolution process, so they must be assumed\nas two independent primordial objects or perhaps two separate parts of a single\nlarger object, that merged in the past to form the present-day cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 15:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We show that such a\nstatement is not precise. We introduce the concept of \\emph{gapped quantum\nliquid} as a special kind of gapped quantum states that can \"dissolve\" any\nproduct states on additional sites. Topologically ordered states actually\ncorrespond to gapped quantum liquids with stable ground-state degeneracy.\nSymmetry-breaking states for on-site symmetry are also gapped quantum liquids,\nbut with unstable ground-state degeneracy. (2) We point out that the\nuniversality classes of generalized local unitary (gLU) transformations\n(without any symmetry) contain both topologically ordered states and\nsymmetry-breaking states. This allows us to use a gLU invariant -- topological\nentanglement entropy -- to probe the symmetry-breaking properties hidden in the\nexact ground state of a finite system, which does not break any symmetry. This\nmethod can probe symmetry- breaking orders even without knowing the symmetry\nand the associated order parameters. (3) The universality classes of\ntopological orders and symmetry-breaking orders can be distinguished by\n\\emph{stochastic local (SL) transformations} (i.e.\\ \\emph{local invertible\ntransformations}): small SL transformations can convert the symmetry-breaking\nclasses to the trivial class of product states with finite probability of\nsuccess, while the topological-order classes are stable against any small SL\ntransformations, demonstrating a phenomenon of emergence of unitarity. This\nallows us to give a new definition of long-range entanglement based on SL\ntransformations, under which only topologically ordered states are long-range\nentangled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 15:54:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 15:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}
