When the dipolar repulsion is sufficiently strong, domains\nundergo forked branching reminiscent of viscous fingering. A known difficulty\nwith these models is that the energy associated with dipole-dipole interactions\nis singular at small distances. Following previous work, we demonstrate how to\nameliorate this singularity and show that in the macroscopic limit, only the\nrelative scale of the microscopic details of a system are relevant, and develop\nan expression for the system energy that depends only on a generalized line\ntension, {\\Lambda}, that in turn depends logarithmically on that scale. We\nconduct numerical studies that use energy minimization to find equilibrium\nstates.

Kinetic neutron\nenergy is removed in constant decrements determined by the Zeeman energy of\nparamagnetic atoms or ions in an external magnetic field, or by zero-field\nlevel splittings in magnetic molecules. Analytical solutions of the stationary\nneutron transport equation are given using inelastic neutron scattering cross\nsections derived in an appendix.

At a neutron\ntemperature about 6 K, for which neutron conversion to ultra-cold neutrons by\nsingle-phonon emission in pure superfluid He4 works best, conversion rates due\nto paramagnetic scattering in the clathrate are found to be a factor 9 larger.\nWhile in conversion the neutron imparts only a single energy quantum to the\nmedium, the multi-step paramagnetic cooling cascade leads to further strong\nenhancements of very-cold neutron densities, e.g., by a factor 14 (57) for an\ninitial neutron temperature of 30 K (100 K), for the moderator held at about\n1.3 K. Due to a favorable Bragg cutoff of the oxygen-clathrate the\ncascade-cooling can take effect in a moderator with linear extensions smaller\nthan a meter.

We provide a definitive compilation of all fundamental properties\nfor the EBs. We also provide a definitive compilation of the various PMS model\nsets. In the H-R diagram, the masses inferred for the individual stars by the\nmodels are accurate to better than 10% above 1 Msun, but below 1 Msun they are\ndiscrepant by 50-100%. We find evidence that the failure of the models to match\nthe data is linked to the triples in the EB sample; at least half of the EBs\npossess tertiary companions. Excluding the triples, the models reproduce the\nstellar masses to better than ~10% in the H-R diagram, down to 0.5 Msun, below\nwhich the current sample is fully contaminated by tertiaries. We consider\nseveral mechanisms by which a tertiary might cause changes in the EB properties\nand thus corrupt the agreement with stellar model predictions. We show that the\nenergies of the tertiary orbits are comparable to that needed to potentially\nexplain the scatter in the EB properties through injection of heat, perhaps\ninvolving tidal interaction. It seems from the evidence at hand that this\nmechanism, however it operates in detail, has more influence on the surface\nproperties of the stars than on their internal structure, as the lithium\nabundances are broadly in good agreement with model predictions. The EBs that\nare members of young clusters appear individually coeval to within 20%, but\ncollectively show an apparent age spread of ~50%, suggesting true age spreads\nin young clusters. However, this apparent spread in the EB ages may also be the\nresult of scatter in the EB properties induced by tertiaries.

In this\nthesis, we have explored the high performance NoC design for MPSoC and CMP\nstructures from the performance modeling in the offline design phase to the\nrouting algorithm and NoC architecture optimization. More specifically, we\nfirst deal with the issue of how to estimate an NoC design fast and accurately\nin the synthesis inner loop. For this purpose, we propose a machine learning\nbased latency regression model to evaluate the NoC designs with respect to\ndifferent configurations. Then, for high performance NoC designs, we tackle one\nof the most important problems, i.e., the routing algorithms design. For\navoiding temperature hotspots, a thermal-aware routing algorithm is proposed to\nachieve an even temperature profile for application-specific Network-on-chips\n(NoCs). For improving the reliability, a routing algorithm to achieve maximum\nperformance under fault is proposed.

In particular, we propose a flit-level speedup scheme to enhance\nthe network-on-chip(NoC) performance utilizing bidirectional channels.

They are ubiquitous throughout the course of a person's life, and\nface recognition is crucial for daily social interaction. Faces are also unlike\nany other stimulus class in terms of certain physical stimulus characteristics.\nFurthermore, faces have been empirically found to elicit certain characteristic\nbehavioral phenomena, which are widely held to be evidence of \"holistic\"\nprocessing of faces. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms\nunderlying such holistic face processing. In other words, for the processing of\nfaces by the primate visual system, the input and output characteristics are\nrelatively well known, but the internal neural computations are not. The main\naim of this work is to further the fundamental understanding of what causes the\nvisual processing of faces to be different from that of objects. In this\ncomputational modeling work, we show that a single factor - \"neural tuning\nsize\" - is able to account for three key phenomena that are characteristic of\nface processing, namely the Composite Face Effect (CFE), Face Inversion Effect\n(FIE) and Whole-Part Effect (WPE). Our computational proof-of-principle\nprovides specific neural tuning properties that correspond to the\npoorly-understood notion of holistic face processing, and connects these neural\nproperties to psychophysical behavior. Overall, our work provides a unified and\nparsimonious theoretical account for the disparate empirical data on\nface-specific processing, deepening the fundamental understanding of face\nprocessing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jun 2014 03:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-17"}

Methods:We used the\nIRAM PdBI interferometer to perform arcsecond resolution images of the CN N=2-1\ntransition with good spectral resolution. Integrated spectra from the 30-m\nradiotelescope show that CN is relatively unaffected by contamination from the\nmolecular clouds. Our sample includes 12 sources, among which isolated stars\nlike DM Tau and MWC 480 are used to demonstrate the method and its accuracy. We\nderive the dynamical mass by fitting a disk model to the emission, a process\ngiving M/D the mass to distance ratio. We also compare the CN results with\nhigher resolution CO data, that are however affected by contamination. Results:\nAll disks are found in nearly perfect Keplerian rotation. We determine accurate\nmasses for 11 stars, in the mass range 0.5 to 1.9 solar masses. The remaining\none, DG Tau B, is a deeply embedded object for which CN emission partially\narises from the outflow. With previous determination, this leads to 14 (single)\nstars with dynamical masses. Comparison with evolutionary tracks, in a distance\nindependent modified HR diagram, show good overall agreement (with one\nexception, CW Tau), and indicate that measurement of effective temperatures are\nthe limiting factor. The lack of low mass stars in the sample does not allow to\ndistinguish between alternate tracks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jun 2014 10:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

The Dawid-Skene estimator has been widely used for inferring the true\nlabels from the noisy labels provided by non-expert crowdsourcing workers.\nHowever, since the estimator maximizes a non-convex log-likelihood function, it\nis hard to theoretically justify its performance. In this paper, we propose a\ntwo-stage efficient algorithm for multi-class crowd labeling problems. The\nfirst stage uses the spectral method to obtain an initial estimate of\nparameters. Then the second stage refines the estimation by optimizing the\nobjective function of the Dawid-Skene estimator via the EM algorithm. We show\nthat our algorithm achieves the optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic\nfactor. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is comparable to\nthe most accurate empirical approach, while outperforming several other\nrecently proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jun 2014 15:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 15:49:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 1 Nov 2014 22:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-04"}

However, quantifying such polygenic effects and their\nrelationship to disease risk has been challenging. In order to address these\ndifficulties we developed a global measure of the information content of an\nindividual's genome relative to a reference population, which may be used to\nassess differences in global genome structure between cases and appropriate\ncontrols. Informally this measure, which we call relative genome information\n(RGI), quantifies the relative \"disorder\" of an individual's genome. In order\nto test its ability to predict disease risk we used RGI to compare single\nnucleotide polymorphism genotypes from two independent samples of women with\nearly-onset breast cancer with three independent sets of controls. We found\nthat RGI was significantly elevated in both sets of breast cancer cases in\ncomparison with all three sets of controls, with disease risk rising sharply\nwith RGI (odds ratio greater than 12 for the highest percentile RGI).\nFurthermore, we found that these differences are not due to associations with\ncommon variants at a small number of disease-associated loci, but rather are\ndue to the combined associations of thousands of markers distributed throughout\nthe genome. Our results indicate that the information content of an\nindividual's genome may be used to measure the risk of a complex disease, and\nsuggest that early-onset breast cancer has a strongly polygenic basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jun 2014 15:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-17"}
