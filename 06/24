In the present case of the inverse gamma distribution\nthe model is integrable in terms of a coordinate Bethe Ansatz, as discovered by\nBrunet. Using the Brunet-Bethe eigenstates we obtain an exact expression for\nthe integer moments of $\\overline{Z^n}$ for polymers of arbitrary lengths and\nfixed endpoint positions.

The strength of these surveys comes from their\nunprecedented depth and width. Optimal extraction of their three-dimensional\ninformation is of utmost importance to best constrain the properties of the\ndark universe. Although there is theoretical motivation and novel tools to\nexplore these surveys using the 3D spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) power\nspectrum of galaxy number counts $C_\\ell(k,k^\\prime)$, most survey\noptimisations and forecasts are based on the tomographic spherical harmonics\npower spectrum $C^{(ij)}_\\ell$. We performed a new investigation of the\ninformation that can be extracted from the tomographic and 3D SFB techniques by\ncomparing the forecast cosmological parameter constraints obtained from a\nFisher analysis in the context of planned stage IV wide-field galaxy surveys.\nThe comparison was made possible by careful and coherent treatment of\nnon-linear scales in the two analyses. Nuisance parameters related to a scale-\nand redshift-dependent galaxy bias were also included for the first time in the\ncomputation of both the 3D SFB and tomographic power spectra. Tomographic and\n3D SFB methods can recover similar constraints in the absence of systematics.\nHowever, constraints from the 3D SFB analysis are less sensitive to unavoidable\nsystematics stemming from a redshift- and scale-dependent galaxy bias. Even for\nsurveys that are optimised with tomography in mind, a 3D SFB analysis is more\npowerful. In addition, for survey optimisation, the figure of merit for the 3D\nSFB method increases more rapidly with redshift, especially at higher\nredshifts, suggesting that the 3D SFB method should be preferred for designing\nand analysing future wide-field spectroscopic surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 17:18:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2015 16:07:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

Several striking features come up.\nTopological charge emerges as a collective flow of quantum numbers carried by\nindividual corpuscles.

Complete accelerator\nmodels agreed with diode measurement within 2%/2 mm at 12 and 20 MeV, and\nwithin 3%/3 mm at 6 MeV. Comparisons of measured depth and profile data showed\ndose-dependencies on jaw position; simulated energy fluences scored just above\nthe phantom showed that, for small apertures, dose dependencies on jaw position\nare dominated by changes in the in-field energy fluence (not scattered by jaws\nor MLC) at 6 MeV, while at 20 MeV dose dependencies are dominated by the\nscattered component. Our models reproduce these jaw position dependencies,\nwhich is an asset as there is no consensus on the optimal position for jaws in\nmodulated electron field delivery. Good agreement between simulation and\nmeasurement and flexibility in jaw position make our models appropriate for use\nin MERT and MPERT planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 18:59:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 22:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-10"}

On these GPUs, the thread block scheduler (TBS) uses the FIFO\npolicy to schedule their thread blocks. We show that FIFO leaves performance to\nchance, resulting in significant loss of performance and fairness. To improve\nperformance and fairness, we propose use of the preemptive Shortest Remaining\nTime First (SRTF) policy instead. Although SRTF requires an estimate of runtime\nof GPU kernels, we show that such an estimate of the runtime can be easily\nobtained using online profiling and exploiting a simple observation on GPU\nkernels' grid structure. Specifically, we propose a novel Structural Runtime\nPredictor. Using a simple Staircase model of GPU kernel execution, we show that\nthe runtime of a kernel can be predicted by profiling only the first few thread\nblocks. We evaluate an online predictor based on this model on benchmarks from\nERCBench, and find that it can estimate the actual runtime reasonably well\nafter the execution of only a single thread block. Next, we design a thread\nblock scheduler that is both concurrent kernel-aware and uses this predictor.\nWe implement the SRTF policy and evaluate it on two-program workloads from\nERCBench. SRTF improves STP by 1.18x and ANTT by 2.25x over FIFO. When compared\nto MPMax, a state-of-the-art resource allocation policy for concurrent kernels,\nSRTF improves STP by 1.16x and ANTT by 1.3x.

It has also been claimed that the resulting Z(M,SFR)\nrelation is invariant with redshift - the so-called Fundamental Metallicity\nRelation (FMR). Given a number of difficulties in determining metallicities,\nespecially at higher redshifts, the form of the Z(M,SFR) relation and whether\nit is really independent of redshift is still very controversial. To explore\nthis issue at z>2, we used VLT-SINFONI and Subaru-MOIRCS near-infrared\nspectroscopy of 20 zCOSMOS-deep galaxies at 2.1<z<2.5 to measure the strengths\nof up to five emission lines: [OII], Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha, and [NII].

Based on N-body simulations,\nwe investigate the morphological and kinematical evolution of the stellar\ncomponent of disks when galaxies undergo fly-by interactions with adjacent dark\nmatter halos. We find that the so-called `S'-shaped warps can be excited by\nfly-bys and sustained for even up to a few billion years, and that this\nscenario provides a cohesive explanation for several key observations. We show\nthat disk warp properties are governed primarily by the following three\nparameters; (1) the impact parameter, i.e., the minimum distance between two\nhalos, (2) the mass ratio between two halos, and (3) the incident angle of the\nfly-by perturber. The warp angle is tied up with all three parameters, yet the\nwarp lifetime is particularly sensitive to the incident angle of the perturber.\nInterestingly, the modeled S-shaped warps are often non-symmetric depending on\nthe incident angle. We speculate that the puzzling U- and L-shaped warps are\ngeometrically superimposed S-types produced by successive fly-bys with\ndifferent incident angles, including multiple interactions with a satellite on\na highly elongated orbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 20:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

It is well known that in the\nnonlinear regime of structure formation, the matter fluctuation field develops\nsuch large tails. It has also been suggested that fields with large tails are\nnot necessarily well described by the hierarchy of $N$-point functions. In this\nthesis, we are able to make this last statement precise and with the help of\nthe lognormal model to quantify precisely its implications for inference on\ncosmological parameters : we find as our main result that only a tiny fraction\nof the total Fisher information of the field is still contained in the\nhierarchy of $N$-point moments in the nonlinear regime, rendering parameter\ninference from such moments very inefficient.

A\nsimilar analysis is then applied to the convergence field, the weighted\nprojection of the matter density fluctuation field along the line of sight,\nwith similar conclusions.

As\nthe first stage of this project, the HPS Test Run apparatus was constructed and\noperated in 2012 to demonstrate the experiment's technical feasibility and to\nconfirm that the trigger rates and occupancies are as expected. This paper\ndescribes the HPS Test Run apparatus and readout electronics and its\nperformance. In this setting, a heavy photon can be identified as a narrow peak\nin the e$^+$e$^-$ invariant mass spectrum, above the trident background or as a\nnarrow invariant mass peak with a decay vertex displaced from the production\ntarget, so charged particle tracking and vertexing are needed for its\ndetection. In the HPS Test Run, charged particles are measured with a compact\nforward silicon microstrip tracker inside a dipole magnet. Electromagnetic\nshowers are detected in a PbW0$_{4}$ crystal calorimeter situated behind the\nmagnet, and are used to trigger the experiment and identify electrons and\npositrons. Both detectors are placed close to the beam line and split\ntop-bottom. This arrangement provides sensitivity to low-mass heavy photons,\nallows clear passage of the unscattered beam, and avoids the spray of degraded\nelectrons coming from the target. The discrimination between prompt and\ndisplaced e$^+$e$^-$ pairs requires the first layer of silicon sensors be\nplaced only 10~cm downstream of the target. The expected signal is small, and\nthe trident background huge, so the experiment requires very large statistics.\nAccordingly, the HPS Test Run utilizes high-rate readout and data acquisition\nelectronics and a fast trigger to exploit the essentially 100% duty cycle of\nthe CEBAF accelerator at JLab.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 00:51:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2014 00:38:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 18:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-05"}

The best known approach is to take a mathematical model of the\nfibered structure, insert it into a more-or-less complex model of cardiac\narchitecture, and then study the resulting fibers of activation that propagate\nthrough the myocardium. In our paper, we have attempted to create a novel\nsoftware capable of demonstrate left ventricular (LV) model in normal hearts.\n  Method: Echocardiography was performed on 70 healthy volunteers. Data\nevaluated included: velocity (radial, longitudinal, rotational and vector\npoint), displacement (longitudinal and rotational), strain rate (longitudinal\nand circumferential) and strain (radial, longitudinal and circumferential) of\nall 16 LV myocardial segments. Using these data, force vectors of myocardial\nsamples were estimated by MATLAB software, interfaced in the echocardiograph\nsystem. Dynamic orientation contraction (through the cardiac cycle) of every\nindividual myocardial fiber could be created by adding together the sequential\nsteps of the multiple fragmented sectors of that fiber. This way we attempted\nto mechanically illustrate the global LV model.\n  Result: Our study shows that in normal cases myocardial fibers initiate from\nthe posterior basal region of the heart, continues through the LV free wall,\nreaches the septum, loops around the apex, ascends, and ends at the\nsuperior-anterior edge of LV.\n  Conclusion: We were able to define the whole LV myocardial model\nmathematically, by MATLAB software in normal subjects.

It casts the evolution of the pressure distribution\n${\\rm Pr}(p)$ with increasing resolution of surface roughness as a diffusive\nprocess, in which resolution plays the role of time. The tested key assumptions\nof the theory are: (a) the diffusion coefficient is independent of pressure\n$p$, (b) the diffusion process is drift-free at any value of $p$, (c) the point\n$p=0$ acts as an absorbing barrier, i.e., once a point falls out of contact, it\nnever reenters again, (d) the Fourier component of the elastic energy is only\npopulated if the appropriate wave vector is resolved, and (e) it no longer\nchanges when even smaller wavelengths are resolved. Using high-resolution\nnumerical simulations, we quantify deviations from these approximations and\nfind quite significant discrepancies in some cases. For example, the drift\nbecomes substantial for small values of $p$, which typically represent points\nin real space close to a contact line. On the other hand, there is a\nsignificant flux of points reentering contact.

Here we show that in lens systems with\ntwo distinct source redshifts, of which the nearest one contributes to the\nlight deflection towards the more distant one, there exists an invariance\ntransformation which leaves all strong lensing observables unchanged (except\nthe product of time delay and Hubble constant), generalizing the well-known\nmass-sheet transformation in single plane lens systems. The transformation\npreserves the relative distribution of mass and light, so that a\n`mass-follows-light' assumption does not fix the MST. All time delays (from\nsources on both planes) scale with the same factor -- time-delay ratios are\ntherefore invariant under the MST. Changing cosmological parameters, and thus\ndistance ratios, is essentially equivalent to such a mass-sheet transformation.\nAs an example, we discuss the double source plane system SDSSJ0946+1006, which\nhas been recently studied by Collett and Auger, and show that variations of\ncosmological parameters within reasonable ranges lead to only a small\nmass-sheet transformation in both lens planes.

We\ncompare the calculations with the results from the standard perturbation theory\nfor the quantum Hamiltonian. There have been proposals in the literature for\nthe non-perturbative contributions based on singularity cancellation with the\nperturbative contributions. We compute the quantum spectrum numerically with\nsome high precisions for many cases of Planck constant. We find that there are\nalso some higher order non-singular non-perturbative contributions, which are\nnot captured by the singularity cancellation mechanism. We fix the first few\norders formulas of such corrections for some well known local Calabi-Yau\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 09:41:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 05:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Due to the improvement of\ninstrumental response function and increase of the statistics, the\nobservational uncertainties of the spectrum in $\\sim$100-300 MeV bands and\n$>10$GeV bands are significantly improved. The present data analysis suggests\nthat the 0.1-100GeV emissions from LS~5039 contain three different components;\n(i) the first component contributes to $<$1GeV emissions around superior\nconjunction, (ii) the second component dominates in 1-10GeV energy bands and\n(iii) the third component is compatible to lower energy tail of the TeV\nemissions.

In this work, we present an extended study of the dust environment of a\nsample of short period comets and their dynamical history. With this aim, we\ncharacterized the dust tails when the comets are active, and we made a\nstatistical study to determine their dynamical evolution. The targets selected\nwere 22P/Kopff, 30P/Reinmuth 1, 78P/Gehrels 2, 115P/Maury, 118P/Shoemaker-Levy\n4, 123P/West-Hartley, 157P/Tritton, 185/Petriew, and P/2011 W2 (Rinner).\nMethods. We use two different observational data: a set of images taken at the\nObservatorio de Sierra Nevada and the Afrho curves provided by the amateur\nastronomical association Cometas-Obs. To model these observations, we use our\nMonte Carlo dust tail code. From this analysis, we derive the dust parameters,\nwhich best describe the dust environment: dust loss rates, ejection velocities,\nand size distribution of particles. On the other hand, we use a numerical\nintegrator to study the dynamical history of the comets, which allows us to\ndetermine with a 90% of confidence level the time spent by these objects in the\nregion of Jupiter Family Comets. Results. From the Monte Carlo dust tail code,\nwe derived three categories attending to the amount of dust emitted: Weakly\nactive (115P, 157P, and Rinner), moderately active (30P, 123P, and 185P), and\nhighly active (22P, 78P, and 118P). The dynamical studies showed that the\ncomets of this sample are young in the Jupiter Family region, where the\nyoungest ones are 22P (100 yr), 78P (500 yr), and 118P (600 yr). The study\npoints to a certain correlation between comet activity and time spent in the\nJupiter Family region, although this trend is not always fulfilled. The largest\nparticle sizes are not tightly constrained, so that the total dust mass derived\nshould be regarded as lower limits.}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 12:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

Due to the hot-electron effect, the\nconductance decreases and the current shows the tendency of the saturation with\nthe increase of the applied electric field. Moreover, the electric field can\nexcite carriers within the surface bands through interband precession and leads\nto a higher conductance. As a joint effect of the hot-electron transport and\nthe carrier excitation, the conductance approaches a finite residual value in\nthe high-field regime and the current saturation becomes incomplete. We thus\ndemonstrate that, contrary to the conjecture in the literature, the observed\ntransport phenomena can be understood qualitatively in the framework of surface\ntransport alone. Furthermore, if a constant bulk conductance which is\ninsensitive to the field is introduced, one can obtain a good quantitative\nagreement between the theoretical results and the experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 13:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-17"}

In this paper we study this phenomenon and formulate\na new condition, the weak Anomalous Localized Reconance (w-ALR), where the\nspeed of the blow up of fields may be slower. Using this concept, we can study\nthe blow up of fields in the presence of negative material parameters without\nthe commonly used quasi-static approximation.

We suggest that reducing\ndimensionality down to a few atom thick crystals could drive a crossover from\nconventional to sign changing pairing in the superconductor 2H-TaS$_2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 13:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-25"}

The MR exhibits a maximum in the temperature range $120-240$ K.\nThe maximum is observed at intermediate magnetic fields ($B=2-6$ T), in between\nthe weak localization and the Shubnikov-de Haas regimes. It results from the\ncompetition of two mechanisms. First, the low field magnetoresistance increases\ncontinuously with $T$ and has a purely classical origin. This positive MR is\ninduced by thermal averaging and finds its physical origin in the energy\ndependence of the mobility around the Fermi energy. Second, the high field\nnegative MR originates from the electron-electron interaction (EEI). The\ntransition from the diffusive to the ballistic regime is observed. The\namplitude of the EEI correction points towards the coexistence of both long and\nshort range disorder in these samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 14:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Lattice QED theory with U(1) group symmetry in two dimensional\nspace-times dimensions has always been a testing ground for algorithms. By the\nother side, motivated by our previews work that the two-grid algorithm converge\nfaster than the standard iterative methods for overlap inversion but not for\nall quark masses, we thought to test this idea in less dimensions such as U(1)\ngauge theory. Our main objective of this paper it is to implement and develop\nthe idea of a two level algorithm in a new algorithm coded in QCDLAB. This\nimplementation is presented in the preconditioned GMRESR algorithm, as our new\ncontribution in QCDLAB package. The preconditioned part of our algorithm,\ndifferent from the one of [18], is the approximation of the overlap operator\nwith the truncated overlap operator with finite N3 dimension. We have tested it\nfor 100 statistically independent configurations on 32 x 32 lattice background\nU(1) field at coupling constant \\b{eta}=1 and for different bare quark masses\nmq = [0.5, 0.45, 0.4, 0.35, 0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1]. We have compared the\nconvergence history of the preconditioned GMRESR residual norm with another\noverlap inverter of QCDLAB as an optimal one, such as SHUMR. We have shown that\nour algorithm converges faster than SHUMR for different quark masses. Also, we\nhave demonstrated that it saves more time for light quarks compared to SHUMR\nalgorithm. Our algorithm is approximately independent from the quark mass. This\nis a key result in simulations with chiral fermions in lattice theories. By the\nother side, if we compare the results of [18] for quark mass 0.1 in SU(3),\nresults that our chosen preconditioned saves a factor of 2 but in U(1). Our\nnext step is to test this algorithm in SU(3) and to adopt it in parallel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 15:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-25"}

In particular, it is crucial to take into account full knowledge of\nthe noise properties when estimating polarization fraction and angle, which\nsuffer from well-known biases. While strong simplifying assumptions have\nusually been made in polarization analysis, we present a method for including\nthe full covariance matrix of the Stokes parameters in estimates for the\ndistributions of the polarization fraction and angle. We thereby quantify the\nimpact of the noise properties on the biases in the observational quantities.\nWe derive analytical expressions for the pdf of these quantities, taking into\naccount the full complexity of the covariance matrix, including the Stokes I\nintensity components. We perform simulations to explore the impact of the noise\nproperties on the statistical variance and bias of the polarization fraction\nand angle. We show that for low variations of the effective ellipticity between\nthe Q and U components around the symmetrical case the covariance matrix may be\nsimplified as is usually done, with negligible impact on the bias. For S/N on\nintensity lower than 10 the uncertainty on the total intensity is shown to\ndrastically increase the uncertainty of the polarization fraction but not the\nrelative bias, while a 10\\% correlation between the intensity and the polarized\ncomponents does not significantly affect the bias of the polarization fraction.\nWe compare estimates of the uncertainties affecting polarization measurements,\naddressing limitations of estimates of the S/N, and we show how to build\nconservative confidence intervals for polarization fraction and angle\nsimultaneously.

Considering the stress in the circular and longitudinal\nsmooth muscles as a sum of passive, depending on muscle deformations, and\nactive, depending on muscle tone, components, and also assuming that the change\nin the muscle tone depends on the current stress-strain condition, the system\nof four ordinary differential equations (ODE) is obtained, which describes\nfilling-emptying cycle of intestinal segment as a process of coordinated\nactivities of circular and longitudinal muscles of intestinal wall.
