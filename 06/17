The gas is assumed to be transparent for the\nradiation emitted by the combustion products, while particles absorb and\nre-emit the radiation. Thermal radiation heats the particles, which in turn\ntransfer the heat to the surrounding gaseous mixture by means of heat\nconduction, so that the gas temperature lags that of the particles. We consider\ndifferent scenarios depending on the spatial distribution of the particles,\ntheir size and the number density. In the case of uniform distribution of the\nparticles the radiation causes a modest increase of the temperature ahead of\nthe flame and the corresponding increase of the flame velocity. The effects of\nradiation preheating is stronger for a flame with smaller normal velocity. In\nthe case of non-uniform distribution of the particles, such that the particles\nnumber density is smaller just ahead of the flame and increases in the distant\nregion ahead of the flame, the preheating caused by the thermal radiation may\ntrigger additional independent source of ignition. This scenario requires the\nformation of a temperature gradient with the maximum temperature sufficient for\nignition in the region of denser particles cloud ahead of the advancing flame.\nDepending on the steepness of the temperature gradient formed in the unburned\nmixture, either deflagration or detonation can be initiated via the Zeldovich's\ngradient mechanism. The ignition and the resulting combustion regimes depend on\nthe temperature profile which is formed in effect of radiation absorption and\ngas-dynamic expansion. In the case of coal dust flames propagating through a\nlayered dust cloud the effect of radiation heat transfer can result in the\npropagation of combustion wave with velocity up to 1000m/s and can be a\nplausible explanation of the origin of dust explosion in coal mines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 16:16:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Jun 2014 10:26:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 11:24:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2015 16:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-03"}

Positron emission tomography\n(PET) systems that require regular calibrations by qualified scanner operators\nare good candidates for such continuous improvements. Furthermore, for scanners\nemploying one-to-one coupling of crystals to photodetectors to achieve enhanced\nspatial resolution and contrast, the calibration task is even more daunting\nbecause of the large number of independent channels involved. To cope with the\nadditional complexity of the calibration and quality control procedures of\nthese scanners, an intelligent system (IS) was designed to perform fault\ndetection and diagnosis (FDD) of malfunctioning channels. The IS can be broken\ndown into four hierarchical modules: parameter extraction, channel fault\ndetection, fault prioritization and diagnosis. Of these modules, the first two\nhave previously been reported and this paper focuses on fault prioritization\nand diagnosis. The purpose of the fault prioritization module is to help the\noperator to zero in on the faults that need immediate attention. The fault\ndiagnosis module will then identify the causes of the malfunction and propose\nan explanation of the reasons that lead to the diagnosis. The FDD system was\nimplemented on a LabPET avalanche photodiode (APD)-based digital PET scanner.\nExperiments demonstrated a FDD Sensitivity of 99.3 % (with a 95% confidence\ninterval (CI) of: [98.7, 99.9]) for major faults. Globally, the Balanced\nAccuracy of the diagnosis for varying fault severities is 92 %.

The core LLRF\ncontrol has been digitally implemented on a PXIe chassis, including an FPGA for\ndigital signal processing and a real time controller. The test bench is\ncompleted with a good quality signal generator used as master frequency\nreference, an analog front end for reference modulation and signal\nconditioning, small RF components completing the circuit, as well as a tunable\nresonant cavity at 80 MHz, whose RF amplitude, phase and frequency are\nreal-time controlled and monitored. The presented LLRF system is mainly\ndigitally implemented using a PXIe platform provided by National Instruments,\nand is based on IQ modulation and demodulation. The system can be configured to\nuse both direct sampling and undersampling techniques, resulting thus in a high\nperformance and versatile RF control system without the need of excessive\ncomputational resources or very high speed acquisition hardware.

An \"image distance\" is\ncomputed for each pair of graphical representations of DNA sequences, and the\ndistances are visualized as a Molecular Distance Map: Each point on the map\nrepresents a DNA sequence, and the spatial proximity between any two points\nreflects the degree of structural similarity between the corresponding\nsequences. The graphical representation of DNA sequences utilized, Chaos Game\nRepresentation (CGR), is genome- and species-specific and can thus act as a\ngenomic signature. Consequently, Molecular Distance Maps could inform species\nidentification, taxonomic classifications and, to a certain extent,\nevolutionary history. The image distance employed, Structural Dissimilarity\nIndex (DSSIM), implicitly compares the occurrences of oligomers of length up to\n$k$ (herein $k=9$) in DNA sequences.

After incorporating one test\nimage into the semantic graph, the absorbing probabilities from the test data\nto each unseen class can be effectively computed; and zero-shot classification\ncan be achieved by finding the class label with the highest absorbing\nprobability.

We investigate the grain opacity k_gr in the atmosphere of\nprotoplanets. This is important for the planetary mass-radius relation since\nk_gr affects the H/He envelope mass of low-mass planets and the critical core\nmass of giant planets. Aims. The goal of this study is to derive an analytical\nmodel for k_gr. Methods. Our model is based on the comparison of the timescales\nof microphysical processes like grain settling in the Stokes and Epstein\nregime, growth by Brownian motion coagulation and differential settling, grain\nevaporation, and grain advection due to envelope contraction. With these\ntimescales we derive the grain size, abundance, and opacity. Results. We find\nthat the main growth process is differential settling. In this regime, k_gr has\na simple functional form and is given as 27 Q/8 H rho in the Epstein regime and\nas 2 Q/H rho for Stokes drag. Grain dynamics lead to a typical radial structure\nof k_gr with high ISM-like values in the top layers but a strong decrease in\nthe deeper parts where the grain-free molecular opacities take over.\nConclusions. In agreement with earlier results we find that k_gr is typically\nmuch lower than in the ISM. The equations also show that a higher dust input in\nthe top layer does not strongly increase k_gr with two important implications.\nFirst, for a formation of giant planet cores via pebbles, there could be the\nissue that pebbles increase the grain input high in the atmosphere due to\nablation. This could potentially increase k_gr hindering giant planet\nformation. Our study shows that this adverse effect should not occur. Second,\nit means that a higher stellar [Fe/H] which presumably leads to a higher\nsurface density of planetesimals only favors giant planet formation without\nbeing detrimental to it due to an increased k_gr. This corroborates the result\nthat core accretion explains the increase of the giant planet frequency with\n[Fe/H].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Jun 2014 14:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

By comparing these maps with the observed emission in CO from the\nMilky Way, we infer the arm/bar geometry that provides a best fit to our\nGalaxy. We find that it is possible to reproduce nearly all features of the l-v\ndiagram in CO emission. There is no model, however, that satisfactorily\nreproduces all of the features simultaneously. Models with 2 arms cannot\nreproduce all the observed arm features, while 4 armed models produce too\nbright local emission in the inner Galaxy. Our best fitting models favour a bar\npattern speed within 50-60km/s/kpc and an arm pattern speed of approximately\n20km/s/kpc, with a bar orientation of approximately 45 degrees and arm pitch\nangle between 10-15 degrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 20:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

A dependence\nof the halo mass function on large-scale mean density is a standard element of\ncosmological theory, allowing mass-dependent biasing to be understood via the\npeak-background split. On the assumption of a Gaussian density field, this\nanalysis can be extended to ask how the mass function depends on the\ngeometrical environment: clusters, filaments, sheets and voids, as classified\nvia the tidal tensor (the Hessian matrix of the gravitational potential). In\nlinear theory, the problem can be solved exactly, and the result is\nattractively simple: the conditional mass function has no explicit dependence\non the local tidal field, and is a function only of the local density on the\nfiltering scale used to define the tidal tensor. There is nevertheless a strong\nimplicit predicted dependence on geometrical environment, because the local\ndensity couples statistically to the derivatives of the potential. We compute\nthe predictions of this model and study the limits of their validity by\ncomparing them to results deduced empirically from $N$-body simulations. We\nhave verified that, to a good approximation, the abundance of haloes in\ndifferent environments depends only on their densities, and not on their tidal\nstructure. In this sense we find relative differences between halo abundances\nin different environments with the same density which are smaller than 13%.\nFurthermore, for sufficiently large filtering scales, the agreement with the\ntheoretical prediction is good, although there are important deviations from\nthe Gaussian prediction at small, non-linear scales.

Extensive research has been devoted to this arena over the last several\ndecades, and as a result, today's denoisers can effectively remove large\namounts of additive white Gaussian noise. A compressed sensing (CS)\nreconstruction algorithm seeks to recover a structured signal acquired using a\nsmall number of randomized measurements. Typical CS reconstruction algorithms\ncan be cast as iteratively estimating a signal from a perturbed observation.\nThis paper answers a natural question: How can one effectively employ a generic\ndenoiser in a CS reconstruction algorithm? In response, we develop an extension\nof the approximate message passing (AMP) framework, called Denoising-based AMP\n(D-AMP), that can integrate a wide class of denoisers within its iterations. We\ndemonstrate that, when used with a high performance denoiser for natural\nimages, D-AMP offers state-of-the-art CS recovery performance while operating\ntens of times faster than competing methods. We explain the exceptional\nperformance of D-AMP by analyzing some of its theoretical features. A key\nelement in D-AMP is the use of an appropriate Onsager correction term in its\niterations, which coerces the signal perturbation at each iteration to be very\nclose to the white Gaussian noise that denoisers are typically designed to\nremove.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 21:20:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 02:59:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2014 06:30:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 16:50:49 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2016 17:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

However, recent work has shown that the excitation of\nspin-orbit misalignment between protoplanetary nebulae and their host stars can\nnaturally arise from gravitational perturbations in multi-stellar systems as\nwell as magnetic disk-star coupling.

As these hybrid WDs can be as massive as 1.30 $M_{\\odot}$,\nnot much mass needs to be accreted for these objects to reach the Chandrasekhar\nlimit and to explode as Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia).

Two fundamental problems are\ncritical for person re-identification, feature representation and metric\nlearning. An effective feature representation should be robust to illumination\nand viewpoint changes, and a discriminant metric should be learned to match\nvarious person images. In this paper, we propose an effective feature\nrepresentation called Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO), and a subspace and\nmetric learning method called Cross-view Quadratic Discriminant Analysis\n(XQDA). The LOMO feature analyzes the horizontal occurrence of local features,\nand maximizes the occurrence to make a stable representation against viewpoint\nchanges. Besides, to handle illumination variations, we apply the Retinex\ntransform and a scale invariant texture operator. To learn a discriminant\nmetric, we propose to learn a discriminant low dimensional subspace by\ncross-view quadratic discriminant analysis, and simultaneously, a QDA metric is\nlearned on the derived subspace.

This leads to decreased sensitivity and accuracy\nin the correlated flux measurement. Aims: To stabilize the N band\ninterferometric signal in MIDI (MID-infrared Interferometric instrument), we\nuse an external fringe tracker working in K band, the so-called FSU-A (fringe\nsensor unit) of the PRIMA (Phase-Referenced Imaging and Micro-arcsecond\nAstrometry) facility at VLTI.

A first characterization of\nthe fringe-tracking performance and resulting gains in the N band are\npresented. In addition, we demonstrate the possibility of using the FSU-A to\nmeasure visibilities in the K band. Methods: We analyzed FSU-A fringe track\ndata of 43 individual observations covering different baselines and object K\nband magnitudes with respect to the fringe-tracking performance. The N band\ngroup delay and phase delay values could be predicted by computing the relative\nchange in the differential water vapor column density from FSU-A data.\nVisibility measurements in the K band were carried out using a scanning mode of\nthe FSU-A. Results: Using the FSU-A K band group delay and phase delay\nmeasurements, we were able to predict the corresponding N band values with high\naccuracy with residuals of less than 1 micrometer. This allows the coherent\nintegration of the MIDI fringes of faint or resolved N band targets,\nrespectively. With that method we could decrease the detection limit of\ncorrelated fluxes of MIDI down to 0.5 Jy (vs. 5 Jy without FSU-A) and 0.05 Jy\n(vs. 0.2 Jy without FSU-A) using the ATs and UTs, respectively. The K band\nvisibilities could be measured with a precision down to ~2%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 04:20:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 12:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

In order to be\nefficient, the HTS devices need to have a sufficiently low value of AC loss, in\naddition to the necessary current-carrying capacity. Most applications are\noperated with currents beyond the current capacity of single conductors and\nconsequently require cabled conductor solutions with much higher current\ncarrying capacity, from a few kA to up to 20-30 kA for large hydro-generators.\nA century ago, in 1914, Ludwig Roebel invented a low-loss cable design for\ncopper cables, which was successively named after him. The main idea behind\nRoebel cables is to separate the current in different strands and to provide a\nfull transposition of the strands along the cable direction. Nowadays, these\ncables are commonly used in the stator of large generators. Based on the same\ndesign concept of their conventional material counterparts, HTS Roebel cables\nfrom REBCO coated conductors were first manufactured at the Karlsruhe Institute\nof Technology (KIT) and have been successively developed in a number of\nvarieties that provide all the required technical features such as fully\ntransposed strands, high transport currents and low AC losses, yet retaining\nenough flexibility for a specific cable design. In the past few years a large\nnumber of scientific papers have been published on the concept, manufacturing\nand characterization of such cables. Times are therefore mature for a review of\nthose results. The goal is to provide an overview and a succinct and\neasy-to-consult guide for users, developers, and manufacturers of this kind of\nHTS cables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 06:02:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 14:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-30"}

Thermal\nfluctuations in fluids are known to lead to a Brownian loss of the swimming\ndirection. As most cells or synthetic swimmers are immersed in external flows,\nwe consider theoretically in this paper the stochastic dynamics of a model\nactive particle (a self-propelled sphere) in a steady general linear flow. The\nstochasticity arises both from translational diffusion in physical space, and\nfrom a combination of rotary diffusion and run-and-tumble dynamics in\norientation space. We begin by deriving a general formulation for all\ncomponents of the long-time mean square displacement tensor for a swimmer with\na time-dependent swimming velocity and whose orientation decorrelates due to\nrotary diffusion alone. This general framework is applied to obtain the\nconvectively enhanced mean-squared displacements of a steadily-swimming\nparticle in three canonical linear flows (extension, simple shear, and\nsolid-body rotation). We then show how to extend our results to the case where\nthe swimmer orientation also decorrelates on account of run-and-tumble\ndynamics. Self-propulsion in general leads to the same long-time temporal\nscalings as for passive particles in linear flows but with increased\ncoefficients. In the particular case of solid-body rotation, the effective\nlong-time diffusion is the same as that in a quiescent fluid, and we clarify\nthe lack of flow-dependence by briefly examining the dynamics in elliptic\nlinear flows. By comparing the new active terms with those obtained for passive\nparticles we see that swimming can lead to an enhancement of the mean-square\ndisplacements by orders of magnitude, and could be relevant for biological\norganisms or synthetic swimming devices in fluctuating environmental or\nbiological flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 07:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-18"}

These good\nactions may not maximise the actor's payoff, but they maximise the other's\npayoff. Consequently, their existence is puzzling for evolutionary theories.\nWhy should you make an effort to help others, even when no reward seems to be\nat stake? Indeed, experiments typically show that humans are heterogeneous:\nsome may help others, while others may not. With the aim of favouring the\nemergence of 'successful cultures', a number of studies has recently\ninvestigated what mechanisms promote the evolution of a particular good action.\nBut still little is known about if and how good actions can spread from person\nto person. For instance, does being recipient of an altruistic act increase\nyour probability of being cooperative with others? Plato's quote, 'Good actions\ngive strength to ourselves and inspire good actions in others', suggests that\nis possible. We have conducted an experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to test\nthis mechanism using economic games. We have measured willingness to be\ncooperative through a standard Prisoner's dilemma and willingness to act\naltruistically using a binary Dictator game. In the baseline treatments, the\nendowments needed to play were given by the experimenters, as usual; in the\ncontrol treatments, they came from a good action made by someone else. Across\nfour different comparisons and a total of 572 subjects, we have never found a\nsignificant increase of cooperation or altruism when the endowment came from a\ngood action. We conclude that good actions do not necessarily inspire good\nactions in others, at least in the ideal scenario of a lab experiment with\nanonymous subjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 09:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-18"}

Nanophotonic waveguides are particularly well suited for such\napplications since they confine photon propagation to a 1D geometry thereby\nincreasing the interaction between light and matter. Adding chiral\nfunctionalities to nanophotonic waveguides lead to new opportunities enabling\nintegrated and robust quantum-photonic devices or the observation of novel\ntopological photonic states. In a regular waveguide, a quantum emitter radiates\nphotons in either of two directions, and photon emission and absorption are\nreverse processes. This symmetry is violated in nanophotonic structures where a\nnon-transversal local electric field implies that both photon emission and\nscattering may become directional. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the\ninternal state of a quantum emitter determines the chirality of single-photon\nemission in a specially engineered photonic-crystal waveguide. Single-photon\nemission into the waveguide with a directionality of more than 90\\% is observed\nunder conditions where practically all emitted photons are coupled to the\nwaveguide. Such deterministic and highly directional photon emission enables\non-chip optical diodes, circulators operating at the single-photon level, and\ndeterministic quantum gates.

We experimentally realize this apparent violation in a controlled\nmanner by enforcing a fair-sampling-like loophole via postselection. Given the\nability to simultaneously obtain high predictability information and high\nvisibility interference fringes for a wide range of coupling strengths and\npostselected states, this work highlights the role of fair-sampling in tests of\nthe duality principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 10:15:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 09:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-20"}

The dose delivered to the tumor and healthy\ntissues have been calculated in both phantoms, with and without GNPs. The\nresults indicates that the dose to the tumor in an eye-ball implanted with COMS\nplaque increases with increasing GNPs concentration inside the target.\nTherefore, the required irradiation time for the tumors in the eye is decreased\nby adding the GNPs prior to treatment. As a result, the dose to healthy tissues\ndecreases when the irradiation time is reduced. Furthermore, a comparison\nbetween the simulated data in an eye phantom made of water and eye phantom made\nof human-eye composition, in the presence of GNPs shows the significance of\nutilizing the composition of eye in ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry.\nNormally, the radiation therapy of cancer patients is designed to deliver a\nrequired dose to the tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy tissues. The\nresults demonstrated that the use of GNPs enable us to overcome this challenge.\nAlso, defining the eye composition instead of water will leads to more accurate\ncalculations of GNPs radiation effects in ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 11:54:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 11:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-14"}

The\nimpurity dynamics has been modeled, in the Lagrangian framework, by a\nsix-dimensional dissipative bailout embedding map. The fluid-parcel dynamics of\nthe base map is embedded in the particle dynamics governed by the map. The base\nmap considered for the present study is the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC)\nmap. We consider the behavior of the system both in the aerosol regime, where\nthe density of the particle is larger than that of the base flow, as well as\nthe bubble regime, where the particle density is less than that of the base\nflow. The phase spaces in both the regimes show rich and complex dynamics with\nthree type of dynamical behaviors - chaotic structures, regular orbits and\nhyperchaotic regions. In the one-action case, the aerosol regime is found to\nhave periodic attractors for certain values of the dissipation and inertia\nparameters. For the aerosol regime of the two-action ABC map, an attractor\nmerging and widening crises is identified using the bifurcation diagram and the\nspectrum of Lyapunov exponents. After the crisis an attractor with two parts is\nseen, and trajectories hop between these parts with period 2. The bubble regime\nof the embedded map shows strong hyperchaotic regions as well as crisis induced\nintermittency with characteristic times between bursts that scale as a power\nlaw behavior as a function of the dissipation parameter. Furthermore, we\nobserve riddled basin of attraction and unstable dimension variability in the\nphase space in the bubble regime. The bubble regime in one-action shows similar\nbehavior.

My main point is that the modern understanding of how\nrenormalizability is a generic feature of quantum field theories at accessible\nenergies gives us a conceptually unified family of Nagelian reductions.\n  That is worth saying since philosophers tend to think of scientific\nexplanation as only explaining an individual event, or perhaps a single law, or\nat most deducing one theory as a special case of another. Here we see a\nframework in which there is a space of theories endowed with enough structure\nthat it provides a family of reductions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 13:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-18"}

The supernova explosions\nthat mark the death of massive stars in these regions often lead to\ninteractions between the supernova remnants (SNRs) and the clouds. These\ninteractions have a profound effect on our understanding of SNRs. Shocks in\nSNRs should be capable of accelerating particles to cosmic ray (CR) energies\nwith efficiencies high enough to power Galactic CRs. X-ray and gamma-ray\nstudies have established the presence of relativistic electrons and protons is\nsome SNRs and provided strong evidence for diffusive shock acceleration as the\nprimary acceleration mechanism, including strongly amplified magnetic fields,\ntemperature and ionization effects on the shock-heated plasmas, and\nmodifications to the dynamical evolution of some systems. Because protons\ndominate the overall energetics of the CRs, it is crucial to understand this\nhadronic component even though electrons are much more efficient radiators and\nit can be difficult to identify the hadronic component. However, near MCs the\ndensities are sufficiently high to allow the gamma-ray emission to be dominated\nby protons.

A typical sequencing study can easily generate\nhundreds of gigabytes of FASTQ files, while public archives such as ENA and\nNCBI and large international collaborations such as the Cancer Genome Atlas can\naccumulate many terabytes of data in this format. Text compression tools such\nas gzip are often employed to reduce the storage burden, but have the\ndisadvantage that the data must be decompressed before it can be used.\n  Here we present BEETL-fastq, a tool that not only compresses FASTQ-formatted\nDNA reads more compactly than gzip, but also permits rapid search for $k$-mer\nqueries within the archived sequences. Importantly, the full FASTQ record of\neach matching read or read pair is returned, allowing the search results to be\npiped directly to any of the many standard tools that accept FASTQ data as\ninput.\n  Results:\n  We show that 6.6 terabytes of human reads in FASTQ format can be transformed\ninto 1.7 terabytes of indexed files, from where we can search for 1, 10, 100,\n1000, a million of 30-mers in respectively 3, 8, 14, 45 and 567 seconds plus 20\nms per output read.

Recently Chon et al.(2013) presented the first supercluster catalogue\nconstructed with a well-defined selection function based on the X-ray\nflux-limited cluster survey, REFLEX II. For the construction of the sample we\nproposed a concept to find the large objects with a minimum overdensity such\nthat most of their mass will collapse in the future. The main goal of the paper\nis to provide support for our concept using simulations that we can, on the\nbasis of our observational sample of X-ray clusters, construct a supercluster\nsample defined by a certain minimum overdensity, and to test how superclusters\ntrace the underlying dark matter distribution. Our results confirm that an\noverdensity in the number of clusters is tightly correlated with an overdensity\nof the dark matter distribution. This enables us to define superclusters such\nthat most of the mass will collapse in the future and to get first-order mass\nestimates of superclusters on the basis of the properties of the member\nclusters. We also show that in this context the ratio of the cluster number\ndensity and dark matter mass density is consistent with the theoretically\nexpected cluster bias. Our previous work provided evidence that superclusters\nare a special environment for density structures of the dark matter to grow\ndifferently from the field as characterised by the X-ray luminosity function.\nHere we confirm for the first time that this originates from a top-heavy mass\nfunction at high statistical significance provided by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov\ntest. We also find in close agreement with observations that the superclusters\noccupy only a small volume of few percent while they contain more than half of\nthe clusters in the present day Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 14:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

At the highest temperature the number of infrared bands is lower\nthan that predicted for centrosymmetric P63/mmc (D6h4) (Z=2) space group due\nhigh temperature anharmonicity and possible defect induced bitetrahedra\nmisalignments. On cooling, at ~1600 K TmMnO3 goes from non-polar to an\nantiferroelectric-ferroelectric polar phase reaching the ferroelectric onset at\nthe ~700 K. The 300 K reflectivity is fitted using 19 oscillators and this\nnumber of phonons is maintained down to 4 K. A weak phonon anomaly in the band\nprofile at 217 cm-1 (4 K) suggests subtle Rare Earth magnetoelectric couplings\nat ~TN and below. A low energy collective excitation is identified as a THz\ninstability associated with room temperature eg electrons in a d-orbital\nfluctuating environment. It condenses into two modes that emerge pinned to the\nE-type antiferromagmetic order hardening simultaneously down to 4 K. They obey\npower laws with TN as the critical temperature and match known zone center\nmagnons. The one peaking at 26 cm-1, with critical exponent \\b{eta}=0.42 as for\nantiferromagnetic order in a hexagonal lattice, is dependent on the Rare Earth.\nThe band at ~50 cm-1, with \\b{eta}=0.25, splits at ~TN into two peaks.

Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) composed of\nsmall unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are flexible, inexpensive and fast to\ndeploy. This makes them a very attractive technology for many civilian and\nmilitary applications. Due to the high mobility of the nodes, maintaining a\ncommunication link between the UAVs is a challenging task. The topology of\nthese networks is more dynamic than that of typical mobile ad hoc networks\n(MANETs) and of typical vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs). As a consequence, the\nexisting routing protocols designed for MANETs partly fail in tracking network\ntopology changes. In this work, we compare two different routing algorithms for\nad hoc networks: optimized link-state routing (OLSR), and predictive-OLSR\n(P-OLSR). The latter is an OLSR extension that we designed for FANETs; it takes\nadvantage of the GPS information available on board. To the best of our\nknowledge, P-OLSR is currently the only FANET-specific routing technique that\nhas an available Linux implementation. We present results obtained by both\nMedia Access Control (MAC) layer emulations and real-world experiments. In the\nexperiments, we used a testbed composed of two autonomous fixed-wing UAVs and a\nnode on the ground. Our experiments evaluate the link performance and the\ncommunication range, as well as the routing performance. Our emulation and\nexperimental results show that P-OLSR significantly outperforms OLSR in routing\nin the presence of frequent network topology changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 15:15:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 10:53:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 13:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

The [O III] position\nvelocity diagram reveals that Kn 61 is a closed, empty, spherical shell with a\nthin border and a filamentary surface expanding at 67.6 km s$^{-1}$, and the\nshell is currently not expanding isotropically. We derived a kinematic age of\n$\\sim$ 1.6$\\times$10$^4$ yrs for an assumed distance of 4 kpc. A photometric\nperiod of $\\sim$ 5.7($\\pm$0.4) days has been detected for Kn 61, indicating\npresence of a possible binary system at its core. A possible link between\nfilamentary, spherical shells and PG 1159-type stars is noted.\n  The morphology of Pa 5 is dominated by an equatorial toroid and faint polar\nextensions. The equatorial region of this planetary nebula is expanding at 45.2\nkms$^{-1}$. The stellar spectrum corresponds to a very hot star and is\ndominated by a steep blue rising continuum and He II, Balmer and Ca II\nphotospheric lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 15:58:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Jun 2014 20:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In\nthis paper, we derive the asymptotic expansion of these variable bandwidth\nkernels for arbitrary bandwidth functions; generalizing the theory of Diffusion\nMaps and Laplacian Eigenmaps. We also derive pointwise error estimates for the\ncorresponding discrete operators which are based on finite data sets;\ngeneralizing a result of Singer which was restricted to fixed bandwidth\nkernels. Our analysis reveals how areas of small sampling density lead to large\nerrors, particularly for fixed bandwidth kernels. We explain the limitation of\nthe existing theory to data sampled from compact manifolds by showing that when\nthe sampling density is not bounded away from zero (which implies that the data\nlies on an open set) the error estimates for fixed bandwidth kernels will be\nunbounded. We show that this limitation can be overcome by choosing a bandwidth\nfunction inversely proportional to the sampling density (which can be estimated\nfrom data) which allows us to control the error estimates uniformly over a\nnon-compact manifold. We numerically verify these results on non-compact\nmanifolds by constructing the generator of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on a\nreal line and a two-dimensional plane using data sampled independently from the\nrespective invariant measures. We also verify our results on compact manifolds\nby constructing the Laplacian on the unit circle and the unit sphere and we\nshow that the variable bandwidth kernels exhibit reduced sensitivity to\nbandwidth selection and give better results for an automatic bandwidth\nselection algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 01:04:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 17:39:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 04:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-15"}

Using a simple\nspin-boson system, we illustrate how a generic donor-acceptor system can be\nbrought into resonance using a narrow band of vibrational modes, such that the\ntransfer efficiency of an electron-hole pair (exciton) is made arbitrarily\nhigh. Coherent transport phenomena in nature are of renewed interest since the\ndiscovery that a photon captured by the light-harvesting complex (LHC) in\nphotosynthetic organisms can be conveyed to a chemical reaction centre with\nnear-perfect efficiency. Classical explanations of the transfer use stochastic\ndiffusion to model the hopping motion of a photo-excited exciton. This accounts\ninadequately for the speed and efficiency of the energy transfer measured in a\nseries of recent landmark experiments. Taking a quantum mechanical perspective\ncan help capture the salient features of the efficient part of that transfer.\nTo show the versatility of the model, we extend it to a multiple minima system\ncomprising seven-sites, reminiscent of the widely studied Fenna-Matthews-Olson\n(FMO) light-harvesting complex. We show that an idealised transport model for\nmultiple minima coupled to a narrow-band phonon can transport energy with\narbitrarily high efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 08:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-24"}
