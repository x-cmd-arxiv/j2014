Based on a\nRician model for the LoS channels, we show, analytically and numerically, that\nLoS interference hinders the achievable secondary user capacity when\ninterference constraints are imposed at the primary user receiver. This is\ncaused by the poor dynamic range of the interference channels fluctuations when\na dominant LoS component exists. In order to improve the capacity of such\nsystem, we propose the usage of an Electronically Steerable Parasitic Array\nRadiator (ESPAR) antennas at the secondary terminals. An ESPAR antenna involves\na single RF chain and has a reconfigurable radiation pattern that is controlled\nby assigning arbitrary weights to M orthonormal basis radiation patterns via\naltering a set of reactive loads. By viewing the orthonormal patterns as\nmultiple virtual dumb antennas, we randomly vary their weights over time\ncreating artificial channel fluctuations that can perfectly eliminate the\nundesired impact of LoS interference. This scheme is termed as Random Aerial\nBeamforming (RAB), and is well suited for compact and low cost mobile terminals\nas it uses a single RF chain. Moreover, we investigate the exposed secondary\nusers problem in a multiuser setting, showing that LoS interference hinders\nmultiuser interference diversity and affects the growth rate of the SU capacity\nas a function of the number of users. Using RAB, we show that LoS interference\ncan actually be exploited to improve multiuser diversity via opportunistic\nnulling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2014 16:10:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2015 09:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-04"}

From the slope of the inverse of the magnification factor, M-theory\npredicts a cortical \"fovea\" in V1 in the order of $40$ by $40$ basic units at\neach receptive field size -- corresponding to a foveola of size around $26$\nminutes of arc at the highest resolution, $\\approx 6$ degrees at the lowest\nresolution.

A growing literature,\nhowever, suggests that people do not quite behave like standard economic agents\nin a variety of environments, both online and offline. What consequences might\nsuch differences have for the optimal design of mechanisms in these\nenvironments? In this paper, we explore this question in the context of optimal\ncontest design for simple agents---agents who strategically reason about\nwhether or not to participate in a system, but not about the input they provide\nto it. Specifically, consider a contest where $n$ potential contestants with\ntypes $(q_i,c_i)$ each choose between participating and producing a submission\nof quality $q_i$ at cost $c_i$, versus not participating at all, to maximize\ntheir utilities. How should a principal distribute a total prize $V$ amongst\nthe $n$ ranks to maximize some increasing function of the qualities of elicited\nsubmissions in a contest with such simple agents?\n  We first solve the optimal contest design problem for settings with\nhomogenous participation costs $c_i = c$. Here, the optimal contest is always a\nsimple contest, awarding equal prizes to the top $j^*$ contestants for a\nsuitable choice of $j^*$. (In comparable models with strategic effort choices,\nthe optimal contest is either a winner-take-all contest or awards possibly\nunequal prizes, depending on the curvature of agents' effort cost functions.)\nWe next address the general case with heterogeneous costs where agents' types\nare inherently two-dimensional, significantly complicating equilibrium\nanalysis. Our main result here is that the winner-take-all contest is a\n3-approximation of the optimal contest when the principal's objective is to\nmaximize the quality of the best elicited contribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2014 19:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-09"}

Using analytical solutions, one-dimensional (1D), and three-dimensional\n(3D) simulations, we constrained the expansion of the ionized bubble depending\non the turbulent level of the parent molecular cloud. A grid of 1D simulations\nwas then computed in order to build isochrone curves for H ii regions in a\npressure-size diagram. This grid of models allowed to date large sample of OB\nassociations and was used on the H ii Region Discovery Survey (HRDS).\nAnalytical solutions and numerical simulations showed that the expansion of H\nii regions is slowed down by the turbulence up to the point where the pressure\nof the ionized gas is in a quasi-equilibrium with the turbulent ram pressure.\nBased on this result, we built a grid of 1D models of the expansion of H ii\nregions in a profile based on Larson laws. The 3D turbulence is taken into\naccount by an effective 1D temperature profile. The ages estimated by the\nisochrones of this grid agree well with literature values of well-known regions\nsuch as Rosette, RCW 36, RCW 79, and M16.

Three-nucleon (3N) interactions can be handled by modern many-body\nmethods.

We show that the behaviour of the mode inertia in a\ngiven mode varies dramatically when the coupling is strong. An approximation of\nperiod spacings is also obtained from the asymptotic dispersion relation, which\nprovides a good estimate of the coupling strength as well as period spacing\nwhen g-mode-like mixed modes are sufficiently dense. By comparing the\ntheoretical coupling strength from the integral expression with the ones from\nfitting methods, we confirmed that the theoretical asymptotic equation is\nproblematic in the evanescent region due to the potential singularities as well\nas the use of the Cowling approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2014 22:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 21:07:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 12:34:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 14:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-23"}

This procedure\ninevitably introduces an arbitrary, scheme-dependent theoretical systematic\nerror in the predictions. In this paper, we show that the renormalization scale\nuncertainties for hadronic $Z$ decays can be greatly reduced by applying the\nprinciple of maximum conformality (PMC), a rigorous extension of the BLM\nmethod. The PMC prediction is independent of the choice of renormalization\nscheme; i.e., it respects renormalization group invariance, and thus it\nprovides an optimal and theoretically rigorous method for setting the\nrenormalization scale. We show that the convergence of the pQCD prediction for\nthe $Z$ hadronic width is greatly improved using the PMC since the divergent\nrenormalon series does not appear. The magnitude of the high-order corrections\nquickly approach a steady point. The PMC predictions also have the property\nthat any residual dependence on the choice of initial scale is highly\nsuppressed, even for low-order predictions. Thus, one obtains optimal\nfixed-order predictions for the $Z$-boson hadronic decay rates thus enabling\nhigh precision tests of the Standard Model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2014 02:37:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 09:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-29"}

The dusty gas is assumed to be a\nmixture of a perfect gas and spherically small solid particles, in which solid\nparticles are continuously distributed. The jump relations across the MHD shock\nfront for the pressure, the density and the velocity of mixture have been\nderived, respectively in terms of a compression ratio across the shock front in\na gas-solid particle two-phase flow. The expressions for the speed of sound,\nadiabatic compressibility of mixture and the change-in-entropy across the MHD\nshock front have also been derived in terms of the compression ratio. Further,\nthe handy forms of MHD shock jump relations have been obtained in terms of the\ninitial volume fraction of small solid particles and the ratio of specific\nheats of the mixture, simultaneously for the two cases viz., (i) when the shock\nis strong and, (ii) when it is weak. Finally, the cases of strong and weak\nshocks are explored under two distinct conditions viz., (i) when the applied\nmagnetic field is strong and, (ii) when the field is weak. The simplified MHD\nshock jump relations for dusty gas reduce to MHD shock jump relations for an\nidea gas when the mass fraction of solid particles in the mixture becomes zero.\nThe effects due to the magnetic field, the mass fraction of solid particles in\nmixture, and the ratio of the density of solid particles to the initial density\nof gas are studied on the pressure, density, velocity of mixture, speed of\nsound, adiabatic compressibility of mixture and the change-in-entropy across\nthe shock front. The results provided a clear picture of whether and how the\npresence of magnetic field and dusty parameters affect the flow field behind\nthe MHD shock front.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2014 11:12:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 06:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

The paper describes the main structural elements of the machine,\nthe high-level architecture, and the dataflow between components. The computer\ncould perform the four basic arithmetic operations using floating-point\nnumbers. Instructions were read from punched tape. A program consisted of a\nsequence of arithmetical operations, intermixed with memory store and load\ninstructions, interrupted possibly by input and output operations. Numbers were\nstored in a mechanical memory. The machine did not include conditional\nbranching in the instruction set. While the architecture of the Z1 is similar\nto the relay computer Zuse finished in 1941 (the Z3) there are some significant\ndifferences. The Z1 implements operations as sequences of microinstructions, as\nin the Z3, but does not use rotary switches as micro-steppers. The Z1 uses a\ndigital incrementer and a set of conditions which are translated into\nmicroinstructions for the exponent and mantissa units, as well as for the\nmemory blocks. Microinstructions select one out of 12 layers in a machine with\na 3D mechanical structure of binary mechanical elements. The exception circuits\nfor mantissa zero, necessary for normalized floating-point, were lacking; they\nwere first implemented in the Z3. The information for this article was\nextracted from careful study of the blueprints drawn by Zuse for the\nreconstruction of the Z1 for the German Technology Museum in Berlin, from some\nletters, and from sketches in notebooks. Although the machine has been in\nexhibition since 1989 (non-operational), no detailed high-level description of\nthe machine's architecture had been available. This paper fills that gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2014 11:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-10"}

In this\npaper, we first operate a preliminary candidate generation stage, towards 100%\nsensitivity at the cost of high FP levels (40 per patient), to harvest volumes\nof interest (VOI). Our 2.5D approach consequently decomposes any 3D VOI by\nresampling 2D reformatted orthogonal views N times, via scale, random\ntranslations, and rotations with respect to the VOI centroid coordinates. These\nrandom views are then used to train a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nclassifier. In testing, the CNN is employed to assign LN probabilities for all\nN random views that can be simply averaged (as a set) to compute the final\nclassification probability per VOI. We validate the approach on two datasets:\n90 CT volumes with 388 mediastinal LNs and 86 patients with 595 abdominal LNs.\nWe achieve sensitivities of 70%/83% at 3 FP/vol. and 84%/90% at 6 FP/vol. in\nmediastinum and abdomen respectively, which drastically improves over the\nprevious state-of-the-art work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2014 22:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-17"}

The method is based on\nconsecutive linear modulations of initially uncorrelated sequence into a\ncorrelated one. Each step of modulation increases the correlations until the\ndesired level has been reached. Robustness and efficiency for the proposed\nalgorithm are tested by generating sequences with inverse power-law\ncorrelations. The substantial increase in the strength of correlation in the\niterative method with respect to the single-step filtering generation is shown\nfor all studied correlation functions. Our results can be used for design of\ndisordered superlattices, waveguides, and surfaces with selective transport\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2014 10:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}
