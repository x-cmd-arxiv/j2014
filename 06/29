In order to constrain these\nmechanisms, we analyze the energy efficiency of jet production 'eta' based on\narchival Chandra observations of 27 nearby, low-luminosity active galactic\nnuclei. We obtain 'eta' as the ratio of the jet power, inferred from the\nenergetics of jet powered X-ray emitting cavities, to the BH mass accretion\nrate Mdot_BH. The standard assumption in estimating Mdot_BH is that all the gas\nfrom the Bondi radius 'r_B' makes it down to the BH. It is now clear, however,\nthat only a small fraction of the gas reaches the hole. To account for this\neffect, we use the standard disk mass-loss scaling, Mdot(r) \\propto (r/r_B)^s\nMdot_Bondi. This leads to much lower values of Mdot_BH and higher values of\n'eta' than in previous studies. If hot accretion flows are characterized by\n0.5<s<0.6 -- on the lower end of recent theoretical and observational studies\n-- then dynamically-important magnetic fields near rapidly spinning BHs are\nnecessary to account for the high eta~100-300 per cent in the sample.

For a canonical set of six category types, two\ndistinct orderings of classification difficulty have been found. One ordering,\nwhich we call paradigm-specific, occurs when adult human learners classify\nobjects with easily distinguishable characteristics such as size, shape, and\nshading. The general order occurs in all other known cases: when adult humans\nclassify objects with characteristics that are not readily distinguished (e.g.,\nbrightness, saturation, hue); for children and monkeys; and when categorization\ndifficulty is extrapolated from errors in identification learning. The\nparadigm-specific order was found to be predictable mathematically by measuring\nthe logical complexity of tasks, i.e., how concisely the solution can be\nrepresented by logical rules.\n  However, logical complexity explains only the paradigm-specific order but not\nthe general order. Here we propose a new difficulty measurement, information\ncomplexity, that calculates the amount of uncertainty remaining when a subset\nof the dimensions are specified. This measurement is based on Shannon entropy.\nWe show that, when the metric extracts minimal uncertainties, this new\nmeasurement predicts the paradigm-specific order for the canonical six category\ntypes, and when the metric extracts average uncertainties, this new measurement\npredicts the general order. Moreover, for learning category types beyond the\ncanonical six, we find that the minimal-uncertainty formulation correctly\npredicts the paradigm-specific order as well or better than existing metrics\n(Boolean complexity and GIST) in most cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jun 2014 17:58:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 13:42:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Jan 2015 16:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-03"}

If the latter were true, then LBVs should be\nconcentrated in young clusters and found alongside main-sequence stars with\nsimilarly high inferred initial mass. This is decidedly not the case. Examining\nlocations of LBVs compared to O stars in our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds\nreveals that LBVs systematically avoid clusters of O stars, and many reside\nover 100 pc from any O star. In the LMC, LBVs are statistically much more\nisolated than O-type stars, and (perhaps most surprisingly) even more isolated\nthan most WR stars. This makes it impossible for LBVs to be massive stars in\ntransition to WR stars. Instead, we propose that massive stars and supernova\n(SN) subtypes are dominated by bifurcated evolutionary paths in interacting\nbinaries, wherein most WR stars and SNeIbc correspond to the mass donors, while\nLBVs (and their lower-mass analogs like B[e] supergiants, which we show to be\neven more isolated) are the mass gainers. LBVs are essentially the late\nevolutionary stage of massive blue stragglers. Through binary mass transfer,\nrejuvinated mass gainers get enriched, spun up, and sometimes kicked far from\ntheir clustered birthsites by their companion's SN. This scenario agrees better\nwith LBVs exploding as SNeIIn and the observed isolation of SNe~IIn and SN\nimpostors. We argue that environmental trends of various SN subtypes are\ninfluenced more by binarity and SN kicks, rather than tracing initial mass as\nis generally assumed.

Expert opinions differ widely and fracture mechanicians must\nwonder why fracking works. Fracture mechanics of individual pressurized cracks\nhas recently been clarified but the vital problem of stability of interacting\nhydraulic cracks escaped attention. Progress in this regard would likely allow\noptimization of fracking and reduction of environmental footprint. The present\narticle first focuses on the classical solutions of the critical states of\nlocalization instability of a system of cooling or shrinkage cracks and shows\nthat these solutions can be transferred to the system of hydraulic cracks. It\nis concluded that if the profile of hydraulic pressure along the cracks can be\nmade almost uniform, with a steep pressure drop at the front, the localization\ninstability can be avoided. To achieve this kind of profile the pumping rate\n(corrected for the leak rate) must not be too high. Subsequently, numerical\nsolutions are presented to show that an idealized system of circular\nequidistant vertical cracks propagating from a horizontal borehole behaves\nsimilarly. It is pointed out that one important role of proppants, as well as\nacids that promote creation debris in the new cracks, is that they partially\nhelp to limit crack closings and thus localization. Based on the extremely low\npermeability of gas shale, one must imagine a hierarchical progressively\nrefined crack systems in which the finest cracks have spacing in the\nsub-centimeter range. The overall conclusion is that what makes fracking work\nis the suppression or mitigation of localization instabilities of crack\nsystems, which requires achieving uniform pressure profiles along the cracks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jun 2014 21:09:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Jul 2014 12:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-08"}

Breaking the symmetries that\nunderlie the gapless nature of the surface modes is predicted to give rise to\nexotic new states of matter. In particular, it has recently been predicted and\nshown that breaking of time reversal symmetry in the form of ferromagnetism can\ngive rise to a gapped state characterized by a zero magnetic field quantized\nHall response and dissipationless longitudinal transport known as the Quantum\nAnomalous Hall (QAH) state. A key question that has thus far remained\nexperimentally unexplored is the relationship of this new type of quantum Hall\nstate with the previously known orbitally driven quantum Hall states. Here, we\nshow experimentally that a ferromagnetic topological insulator exhibiting the\nQAH state is well described by the global phase diagram of the quantum Hall\neffect. By mapping the behavior of the conductivity tensor in the parameter\nspace of temperature, magnetic field, and chemical potential in the vicinity of\nthe QAH phase, we find evidence for quantum criticality and delocalization\nbehavior that can quantitatively be described by the renormalization group\nproperties of the quantum Hall ground state. This result demonstrates that the\nQAH state observed in ferromagnetic topological insulators can be understood\nwithin the context of the law of corresponding states which governs the quantum\nHall state. This suggests a roadmap for studying the QAH effect including\ntransitions to possible adjacent topologically non-trivial states and a\npossible universality class for the QAH transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jun 2014 01:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-15"}

However, systematic estimation on the\nuncertainties of the commonly used deprojection methods is still lacking.\nSimulated galaxies are well suited in this study. We project two simulated\nbarred galaxies onto a 2D plane with different bar orientations and disk\ninclination angles ($i$). Bar properties are measured and deprojected with the\npopular deprojection methods in the literature. Generally speaking,\ndeprojection uncertainties increase with increasing $i$. All the deprojection\nmethods behave badly when $i$ is larger than $60^\\circ$, due to vertical\nthickness of the bar. Thus, future statistical studies of barred galaxies\nshould exclude galaxies more inclined than $60^\\circ$. At moderate inclination\nangles ($i\\leq60^\\circ$), 2D deprojection methods (analytical and image\nstretching) and Fourier-based methods (Fourier decomposition and bar-interbar\ncontrast) perform reasonably well with uncertainties $\\sim10\\%$ in both the bar\nlength and ellipticity. Whereas the uncertainties of the 1D analytical\ndeprojection can be as high as $100\\%$ in certain extreme case.\n  We find that different bar measurement methods show systematic differences in\nthe deprojection uncertainties.

A centroidal locating set of\n$G$ of minimum size is called a centroidal basis, and its size is the\ncentroidal dimension $CD(G)$. This notion, which is related to previous\nconcepts, gives a new way of identifying the vertices of a graph. The\ncentroidal dimension of a graph $G$ is lower- and upper-bounded by the metric\ndimension and twice the location-domination number of $G$, respectively.
