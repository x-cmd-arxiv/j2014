First, parallel performance of\nOpenFOAM is tested by performing a scaling study up to $2048$ processors on a\nsupercomputer of Flemish Supercomputer Center(VSC). Then, a method to improve\nthe parallel efficiency is proposed. The method is based on developing a hybrid\nconcept to calculate the statistical moments. This new concept combines\nensemble and time averaging in order to allow data sampling in parallel. The\nmotivation is obtaining a reduction in the walltime to collect turbulent\nstatistics which is observed to be the dominating part in the ZNMF controlled\njet flow. Employing this parallel statistical averaging approach in combination\nwith regular grid partitioning parallelism, allowed us conducting DNS cases on\n$P=624$ processors with an overall speed-up of $S_e=540.56$ and a parallel\nefficiency of $E_e=0.87$. The parallelization using only grid partitioning\nexhibited inferior performance with $S_e=423.94$ and $E_e=0.68$. In addition to\ndevelop a methodology to increase the parallel performance, we reduced the time\nstep cost of the existing unsteady solver as well. To this end, an incremental\nprojection method is implemented into OpenFOAM and a performance gain above\n$30\\%$ is realized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2014 16:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-30"}

The LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) radio telescope is a giant digital\nphased array interferometer with multiple antennas distributed in Europe. It\nprovides discrete sets of Fourier components of the sky brightness. Recovering\nthe original brightness distribution with aperture synthesis forms an inverse\nproblem that can be solved by various deconvolution and minimization methods\nAims. Recent papers have established a clear link between the discrete nature\nof radio interferometry measurement and the \"compressed sensing\" (CS) theory,\nwhich supports sparse reconstruction methods to form an image from the measured\nvisibilities. Empowered by proximal theory, CS offers a sound framework for\nefficient global minimization and sparse data representation using fast\nalgorithms. Combined with instrumental direction-dependent effects (DDE) in the\nscope of a real instrument, we developed and validated a new method based on\nthis framework Methods. We implemented a sparse reconstruction method in the\nstandard LOFAR imaging tool and compared the photometric and resolution\nperformance of this new imager with that of CLEAN-based methods (CLEAN and\nMS-CLEAN) with simulated and real LOFAR data Results. We show that i) sparse\nreconstruction performs as well as CLEAN in recovering the flux of point\nsources; ii) performs much better on extended objects (the root mean square\nerror is reduced by a factor of up to 10); and iii) provides a solution with an\neffective angular resolution 2-3 times better than the CLEAN images.\nConclusions. Sparse recovery gives a correct photometry on high dynamic and\nwide-field images and improved realistic structures of extended sources (of\nsimulated and real LOFAR datasets).

We studied the aperture of the density\ndiscontinuities, and found that while the NW discontinuity spans the whole\nlength of the NW radio relic, the arc spanned by the SE discontinuity is\nshorter than the arc spanned by the SE relic. This startling result is in\napparent contradiction with our current understanding of the origin of radio\nrelics.

We derive analytically the consequences of the observed\nconstancy of the faint-end slope since redshifts of at least z ~ 2. If the\nlogarithmic slope of the sSFR-mass relation is negative, then the faint-end\nslope should quickly diverge due to the differential mass increase of galaxies\non the star-forming main sequence, and this will also quickly destroy the\nSchechter form of the mass function. This problem can be solved by removing low\nmass galaxies by merging them into more massive galaxies. We quantify this\nprocess by introducing the specific merger mass rate (sMMR) as the specific\nrate of mass added to a given galaxy through mergers. For a modest negative\nvalue of the logarithmic slope of the sSFR-mass relation of beta ~ -0.1, an\naverage sMMR ~ 0.1sSFR across the population is required to keep the faint-end\nslope constant with epoch, as observed. This in turn implies a merger rate of ~\n0.2sSFR for major mergers, which is consistent with the available observational\nestimates. More negative values of beta require higher sMMR and higher merger\nrates, and the steepening of the mass function becomes impossible to control\nfor beta < ~ -0.6, for an observed value of the faint-end slope of ~ -1.4. The\nclose link that is required between the in situ sSFR and the sMMR probably\narises because both are closely linked to the buildup of dark matter haloes.\nThese new findings further develop the formalism for the evolving galaxy\npopulation that we introduced earlier, and show how striking symmetries in the\ngalaxy population can emerge as the result of deep links between the physical\nprocesses involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2014 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-21"}

The\nphotodissociation of N$_2$ has recently been quantified by laboratory and\ntheoretical studies. Improvements have also been made for CO photodissociation.\nFor the first time, we use accurate N$_2$ and CO photodissociation rates and\nshielding functions in a model of the circumstellar envelope of the carbon-rich\nAGB star, IRC +10216. We use a state-of-the-art chemical model of an AGB\nenvelope, the latest CO and N$_2$ photodissociation data, and a new method for\nimplementing molecular shielding functions in full spherical geometry with\nisotropic incident radiation. We compare computed column densities and radial\ndistributions of molecules with observations. The transition of N$_2$ $\\to$ N\n(also, CO $\\to$ C $\\to$ C$^+$) is shifted towards the outer envelope relative\nto previous models. This leads to different column densities and radial\ndistributions of N-bearing species, especially those species whose\nformation/destruction processes largely depend on the availability of atomic or\nmolecular nitrogen, for example, C$_n$N ($n$=1, 3, 5), C$_n$N$^-$ ($n$=1, 3,\n5), HC$_n$N ($n$=1, 3, 5, 7, 9), H$_2$CN and CH$_2$CN. The chemistry of many\nspecies is directly or indirectly affected by the photodissociation of N$_2$\nand CO, especially in the outer shell of AGB stars where photodissociation is\nimportant. Thus, it is important to include N$_2$ and CO shielding in\nastrochemical models of AGB envelopes and other irradiated environments. In\ngeneral, while differences remain between our model of IRC +10216 and the\nobserved molecular column densities, better agreement is found between the\ncalculated and observed radii of peak abundance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jun 2014 04:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

While the majority of the target stars\nare main-sequence dwarfs of spectral type F, G, and K, Kepler covers stars with\neffective temperature as low as 2500 K, which corresponds to M stars. These\ncooler stars allow characterization of small planets near the habitable zone,\nyet it is not clear if this population is representative of that around FGK\nstars. In this paper, we calculate the occurrence of planets around stars of\ndifferent spectral types as a function of planet radius and distance from the\nstar, and show that they are significantly different from each other. We\nfurther identify two trends: First, the occurrence of Earth to Neptune-sized\nplanets is successively higher toward later spectral types at all orbital\nperiods probed by Kepler; Planets around M stars occur twice as frequently as\naround G stars, and thrice as frequently as around F stars. Second, a drop in\nplanet occurrence is evident at all spectral types inward of a 10 day orbital\nperiod, with a plateau further out. By assigning to each spectral type a median\nstellar mass, we show that the distance from the star where this drop occurs is\nstellar mass dependent, and scales with semi-major axis as the cube root of\nstellar mass. By comparing different mechanisms of planet formation, trapping\nand destruction, we find that this scaling best matches the location of the\npre-main-sequence co-rotation radius, indicating efficient trapping of\nmigrating planets or planetary building blocks. These results demonstrate the\nstellar-mass dependence of the planet population, both in terms of occurrence\nrate and of orbital distribution. The prominent stellar-mass dependence of the\ninner boundary of the planet population shows that the formation or migration\nof planets is sensitive to the stellar parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jun 2014 05:00:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 03:42:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Jan 2015 03:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

First, we argue on\ntheoretical grounds that a data-driven approach is inherently ill-conditioned\nwhen the desired FPR is low, because by the very nature of the challenge only a\nsmall portion of training data affects or is affected by the desired threshold.\nThis leads us to propose a general, statistical model-based method instead.

There are some identity validation services that perform\nusers identity validation, but they are passive services and they only protect\nusers who are informed on privacy concerns and online identity issues. This\npaper starts with an explanation of two types of profile cloning attacks are\nexplained and a new approach for detecting clone identities is proposed by\ndefining profile similarity and strength of relationship measures. According to\nsimilar attributes and strength of relationship among users which are computed\nin detection steps, it will be decided which profile is clone and which one is\ngenuine by a predetermined threshold. Finally, the experimental results are\npresented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jun 2014 09:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-01"}

High order time discretization is achieved via a one-step ADER\napproach that uses a local space-time discontinuous Galerkin predictor method.\nOur new limiting strategy is based on the so-called MOOD paradigm, which\naposteriori verifies the validity of a discrete candidate solution against\nphysical and numerical detection criteria. Within the DG scheme on the main\ngrid, the discrete solution is represented by piecewise polynomials of degree\nN. For those troubled cells that need limiting, our new limiter approach\nrecomputes the discrete solution by scattering the DG polynomials at the\nprevious time step onto a set of N_s=2N+1 finite volume subcells per space\ndimension. A robust but accurate ADER-WENO finite volume scheme then updates\nthe subcell averages of the conservative variables within the detected troubled\ncells. The choice of N_s=2N+1 subcells is optimal since it allows to match the\nmaximum admissible time step of the finite volume scheme on the subgrid with\nthe maximum admissible time step of the DG scheme on the main grid. We\nillustrate the performance of the new scheme via the simulation of numerous\ntest cases in two and three space dimensions, using DG schemes of up to tenth\norder of accuracy in space and time (N=9). The method is also able to run on\nmassively parallel large scale supercomputing infrastructure, which is shown\nvia one 3D test problem that uses 10 billion space-time degrees of freedom per\ntime step.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jun 2014 15:44:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Aug 2014 09:51:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 13:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-11"}

We present here a comparative study of the stellar\nmetallicity and age distributions in a sample of 62 nearly face-on, spiral\ngalaxies with and without bars, using data from the CALIFA survey. We measure\nthe slopes of the gradients and study their relation with other properties of\nthe galaxies. We find that the mean stellar age and metallicity gradients in\nthe disc are shallow and negative. Furthermore, when normalized to the\neffective radius of the disc, the slope of the stellar population gradients\ndoes not correlate with the mass or with the morphological type of the\ngalaxies. Contrary to this, the values of both age and metallicity at $\\sim$2.5\nscale-lengths correlate with the central velocity dispersion in a similar\nmanner to the central values of the bulges, although bulges show, on average,\nolder ages and higher metallicities than the discs. One of the goals of the\npresent paper is to test the theoretical prediction that non-linear coupling\nbetween the bar and the spiral arms is an efficient mechanism for producing\nradial migrations across significant distances within discs. The process of\nradial migration should flatten the stellar metallicity gradient with time and,\ntherefore, we would expect flatter stellar metallicity gradients in barred\ngalaxies. However, we do not find any difference in the metallicity or age\ngradients in galaxies with without bars. We discuss possible scenarios that can\nlead to this absence of difference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jun 2014 06:59:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 18:11:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2015 15:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}
