While quantities like\ncorrelation of $X,Y$ only test for (univariate) linear independence, natural\nalternatives like mutual information of $X,Y$ are hard to estimate due to a\nserious curse of dimensionality. A recent approach, avoiding both issues,\nestimates norms of an \\textit{operator} in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces\n(RKHSs).

For the\ndiscontinuous Galerkin semi-Lagrangian method, however, we find that the\ncharacteristic property of semi-Lagrangian error estimates (namely the fact\nthat the error increases proportionally to the number of time steps) is not\nobserved. We provide an explanation for this behavior and conduct numerical\nsimulations that corroborate the different qualitative features of the error in\nthe two respective types of semi-Lagrangian methods.\n  The method based on the fast Fourier transform is exact but, due to round-off\nerrors, susceptible to a linear increase of the error in the number of time\nsteps. We show how to modify the Cooley--Tukey algorithm in order to obtain an\nerror growth that is proportional to the square root of the number of time\nsteps.\n  Finally, we show, for a simple model, that our conclusions hold true if the\nadvection solver is used as part of a splitting scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2014 21:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-06"}

These models present some characteristics in\ncommon and to select one of them in a practical situation can be of great\ninterest. With this in mind, in this paper we propose a method of selection\nbetween the beta and Kumaraswamy distributions. We use the logarithm of the\nlikelihood ratio statistic (denoted by $T_n$, where $n$ is the sample size) and\nobtain its asymptotic distribution under the hypotheses $H_{\\mathcal B}$ and\n$H_{\\mathcal K}$, where $H_{\\mathcal B}$ ($H_{\\mathcal K}$) denotes that the\ndata come from the beta (Kumaraswamy) distribution.

We obtain an approximation for the probability of correct selection\nunder the hypotheses $H_{\\mathcal B}$ and $H_{\\mathcal K}$ and select the model\nthat maximizes it.

At its core, the assumption is that the signal of interest is\nsparse with respect to either a fixed transformation or a signal dependent\ndictionary. To better capture the data characteristics, various dictionary\nlearning methods have been proposed for both reconstruction and classification\ntasks. For classification particularly, most approaches proposed so far have\nfocused on designing explicit constraints on the sparse code to improve\nclassification accuracy while simply adopting $l_0$-norm or $l_1$-norm for\nsparsity regularization. Motivated by the success of structured sparsity in the\narea of Compressed Sensing, we propose a structured dictionary learning\nframework (StructDL) that incorporates the structure information on both group\nand task levels in the learning process. Its benefits are two-fold: (i) the\nlabel consistency between dictionary atoms and training data are implicitly\nenforced; and (ii) the classification performance is more robust in the cases\nof a small dictionary size or limited training data than other techniques.\nUsing the subspace model, we derive the conditions for StructDL to guarantee\nthe performance and show theoretically that StructDL is superior to $l_0$-norm\nor $l_1$-norm regularized dictionary learning for classification. Extensive\nexperiments have been performed on both synthetic simulations and real world\napplications, such as face recognition and object classification, to\ndemonstrate the validity of the proposed DL framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jun 2014 02:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-10"}

We also show how the data structures and access patterns of\nH-matrices for low-rank operators map onto those of fast multipole, leading to\nan algebraically generalized form of fast multipole that compromises none of\nits architecturally ideal properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jun 2014 11:48:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-10"}

Levy spatial diffusion has been observed for a\ncollection of ultra-cold Rb atoms and single Mg+ ions in an optical lattice.\nUsing the semiclassical theory of Sisyphus cooling, we treat the problem as a\ncoupled Levy walk, with correlations between the length and duration of the\nexcursions. The problem is related to the area under Bessel excursions,\noverdamped Langevin motions that start and end at the origin, constrained to\nremain positive, in the presence of an external logarithmic potential. In the\nlimit of a weak potential, the Airy distribution describing the areal\ndistribution of the Brownian excursion is found. Three distinct phases of the\ndynamics are studied: normal diffusion, Levy diffusion and, below a certain\ncritical depth of the optical potential, x~ t^{3/2} scaling. The focus of the\npaper is the analytical calculation of the joint probability density function\nfrom a newly developed theory of the area under the Bessel excursion. The\nlatter describes the spatiotemporal correlations in the problem and is the\nmicroscopic input needed to characterize the spatial diffusion of the atomic\ncloud. A modified Montroll-Weiss (MW) equation for the density is obtained,\nwhich depends on the statistics of velocity excursions and meanders. The\nmeander, a random walk in velocity space which starts at the origin and does\nnot cross it, describes the last jump event in the sequence. In the anomalous\nphases, the statistics of meanders and excursions are essential for the\ncalculation of the mean square displacement, showing that our correction to the\nMW equation is crucial, and points to the sensitivity of the transport on a\nsingle jump event. Our work provides relations between the statistics of\nvelocity excursions and meanders and that of the diffusivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jun 2014 13:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

We study the imaginary\npart of the static potential of heavy quarkonia moving in the strongly coupled\nplasma. The imaginary potential dependence on the velocity of the traveling\nbound states is calculated. Non-zero velocity leads to increase of the absolute\nvalue of the imaginary potential. The enhancement is stronger when the\nquarkonia move orthogonal to the quark-gluon plasma maximizing the flux between\nthe pair. Moreover, we estimate the thermal width of the moving bound state and\nfind it enhanced compared to the static one. Our results imply that the moving\nquarkonia dissociate easier than the static ones in agreement with the\nexpectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jun 2014 15:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

By considering a\ngeneral anomalous liquid, suitable for globular proteins, colloids or liquid\nmetals, we study by molecular dynamics simulations the effect of a solvophilic\nstructured and a solvophobic unstructured wall on the phases, the crystal\nnucleation and the dynamics of the fluid. We find that at low temperatures the\nlarge density of the solvophilic wall induces a high-density, high-energy\nstructure in the first layer (\"tempting\" effect). In turn, the first layer\ninduces a \"molding\" effect on the second layer determining a structure with\nreduced energy and density, closer to the average density of the system. This\nlow-density, low-energy structure propagates further through the layers by\ntemplating effect and can involve all the existing layers at the lowest\ntemperatures investigated. Therefore, although the high-density, high-energy\nstructure does not self-reproduce further than the first layer, the structured\nwall can have a long-range effect thanks to a sequence of templating, molding\nand templating effects through the layers. We find dynamical slowing down of\nthe solvent near the solvophilic wall but with largely heterogeneous dynamics\nnear the wall due to superdiffusive liquid veins within a frozen matrix of\nsolvent. Hence, the partial freezing of the first hydration layer does not\ncorrespond necessarily to an effective reduction of the channel section in\nterms of transport properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Jun 2014 15:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Such problems either require longer time to converge to an optimum\nsolution, or may not converge at all. Recently some researchers have claimed\nthat real culprit for increasing the hardness of multi-objective problems are\nnot the number of objectives themselves rather it is the increased size of\nsolution set, incompatibility of solutions, and high probability of finding\nsuboptimal solution due to increased number of local maxima. In this work, we\nhave setup a simple framework for the evaluation of hardness of multi-objective\ngenetic algorithms (MOGA).

A rigorous set of experiments are\nperformed for quantifying the hardness in terms of evolution for increasing\nnumber of objective functions. In genetic algorithm, crossover and mutation\nwith equal probability are applied to create offspring in each generation.\nFirst, each objective function is maximized individually by ranking the\ncompeting players on the basis of the fitness (cost) function, and then a\nmulti-objective cost function (sum of individual cost functions) is maximized\nwith ranking, and also without ranking where dominated solutions are also\nallowed to evolve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2014 20:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-11"}

Attention to the gauge generator G\nof Rosenfeld, Anderson, Bergmann, Castellani et al., a specially tuned sum of\nfirst-class constraints, facilitates seeing that a solitary first-class\nconstraint in fact generates not a gauge transformation, but a bad physical\nchange in electromagnetism (changing E) or GR. The change spoils the Lagrangian\nconstraints in terms of the physically relevant velocities rather than\nauxiliary canonical momenta. While Maudlin has defended change in GR much as G.\nE. Moore resisted skepticism, there remains a need to exhibit the technical\nflaws in the argument.\n  Insistence on Hamiltonian-Lagrangian equivalence, a theme emphasized by\nMukunda, Castellani, Sugano, Pons, Salisbury, Shepley and Sundermeyer among\nothers, holds the key. Taking objective change to be ineliminable time\ndependence, there is change in vacuum GR just in case there is no time-like\nvector field satisfying Killing's equation. Throwing away the spatial\ndependence of GR for convenience, one finds that the time evolution from\nHamilton's equations is real change just when there is no time-like Killing\nvector. Hence change is real and local even in the Hamiltonian formalism.\n  The considerations here resolve the Earman-Maudlin standoff: the Hamiltonian\nformalism is helpful, and, suitably reformed, it does not have absurd\nconsequences for change. Hence the classical problem of time is resolved, apart\nfrom the issue of observables, for which the solution is outlined. The quantum\nproblem of time, however, is not automatically resolved due to issues of\nquantum constraint imposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2014 16:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-10"}
