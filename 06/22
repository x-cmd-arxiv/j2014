At least two\nseparate kinematic components have been identified, one characterised by\nvelocity shifts of tens to hundreds km/s (HVC) and one with much lower velocity\nof few km/s (LVC). The HVC are convincingly associated to the emission of jets,\nbut the origin of the LVC is still unknown.

However, we show that SDP-1 exactly recovers\ntrue communities over a wider class of SBMs than those covered by current\nresults. In particular, the assumption of strong assortativity of the SBM,\nimplicit in consistency conditions for previously proposed SDPs, can be relaxed\nto weak assortativity for our approach, thus significantly broadening the class\nof SBMs covered by the consistency results. We also show that strong\nassortativity is indeed a necessary condition for exact recovery for previously\nproposed SDP approaches and not an artifact of the proofs. Our analysis of SDPs\nis based on primal-dual witness constructions, which provides some insight into\nthe nature of the solutions of various SDPs. We show how to combine features\nfrom SDP-1 and already available SDPs to achieve the most flexibility in terms\nof both assortativity and block-size constraints, as our relaxation has the\ntendency to produce communities of similar sizes. This tendency makes it the\nideal tool for fitting network histograms, a method gaining popularity in the\ngraphon estimation literature, as we illustrate on an example of a social\nnetworks of dolphins. We also provide empirical evidence that SDPs outperform\nspectral methods for fitting SBMs with a large number of blocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jun 2014 20:08:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 17:36:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 14:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-17"}

In this work, a discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme (DUGKS)\nfor compressible flows with the consideration of heat transfer and shock\ndiscontinuity is developed based on the Shakhov model with an adjustable\nPrandtl number. The method is an explicit finite-volume scheme where the\ntransport and collision processes are coupled in the evaluation of the fluxes\nat cell interfaces, so that the nice asymptotic preserving (AP) property is\nretained, such that the time step is limited only by the CFL number, the\ndistribution function at cell interface recovers to the Chapman-Enskog one in\nthe continuum limit while reduces to that of free-transport for free-molecular\nflow, and the time and spatial accuracy is of second-order accuracy in smooth\nregion. These features make the DUGKS an ideal method for multiscale\ncompressible flow simulations. A number of numerical tests, including the shock\nstructure problem, the Sod tube problem with different degree of\nnon-equilibrium, and the two-dimensional Riemann problem in continuum and\nrarefied regimes, are performed to validate the scheme. The comparisons with\nthe results of DSMC and other benchmark data demonstrate that the DUGKS is a\nreliable and efficient method for multiscale compressible flow computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jun 2014 03:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

These\nalgorithms are designed for very sparse networks and do not work well when the\ndegrees of the nodes are relatively larger. For networks with larger degrees,\nMap-Reduce based algorithm generates prohibitively large intermediate data, and\nin MPI based algorithms with overlapping partitions, each partition can grow as\nlarge as the original network, wiping out the benefit of partitioning the\nnetwork.\n  In this paper, we present two efficient MPI-based parallel algorithms for\ncounting triangles in massive networks with large degrees.

Methods. We analyse the full sample of\nMASSIV galaxies for which a metallicity estimate has been possible, that is 48\nstar-forming galaxies at $z\\sim 0.9-1.8$, and compute the integrated values of\nsome fundamental parameters, such as the stellar mass, the metallicity and the\nstar formation rate (SFR).

In this\npaper we introduce runtime enforcement of specifications on component-based\nsystems (CBS) modeled in the BIP (Behavior, Interaction and Priority)\nframework. BIP is a powerful and expressive component-based framework for\nformal construction of heterogeneous systems. However, because of BIP\nexpressiveness, it remains difficult to enforce at design-time complex\nbehavioral properties.\n  First we propose a theoretical runtime enforcement framework for CBS where we\ndelineate a hierarchy of sets of enforceable properties (i.e., properties that\ncan be enforced) according to the number of observational steps a system is\nallowed to deviate from the property (i.e., the notion of k-step\nenforceability). To ensure the observational equivalence between the correct\nexecutions of the initial system and the monitored system, we show that i) only\nstutter-invariant properties should be enforced on CBS with our monitors, ii)\nsafety properties are 1-step enforceable. Given an abstract enforcement monitor\n(as a finite-state machine) for some 1-step enforceable specification, we\nformally instrument (at relevant locations) a given BIP system to integrate the\nmonitor. At runtime, the monitor observes and automatically avoids any error in\nthe behavior of the system w.r.t. the specification.

Considering multiple\nCUs available, we propose the round-robin scheduling as well as the optimal and\nsuboptimal user scheduling schemes for improving the security of CUs-CBS\ntransmissions against eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, the optimal user\nscheduling is designed by assuming that the channel state information (CSI) of\nall links from CUs to CBS, to primary user (PU) and to eavesdroppers are\navailable. By contrast, the suboptimal user scheduling only requires the CSI of\nCUs-CBS links without the PU's and eavesdroppers' CSI. We derive closed-form\nexpressions of the secrecy outage probability of these three scheduling schemes\nin the presence of the coordinated and uncoordinated eavesdroppers. We also\ncarry out the secrecy diversity analysis and show that the round-robin\nscheduling achieves the diversity order of only one, whereas the optimal and\nsuboptimal scheduling schemes obtain the full secrecy diversity, no matter\nwhether the eavesdroppers collaborate or not. In addition, numerical secrecy\noutage results demonstrate that for both the coordinated and uncoordinated\neavesdroppers, the optimal user scheduling achieves the best security\nperformance and the round-robin scheduling performs the worst.
