The mechanism\nresponsible for this depletion is still under debate. To constrain the models\nit is mandatory to have a good understanding of the properties of the gas\ncontent of the inner disk. Using X-Shooter broad band -UV to NIR- medium\nresolution spectroscopy we derive the stellar, accretion, and wind properties\nof a sample of 22 TDs. The analysis of these properties allows us to put strong\nconstraints on the gas content in a region very close to the star (<0.2 AU)\nwhich is not accessible with any other observational technique. We fit the\nspectra with a self-consistent procedure to derive simultaneously SpT,Av,and\nmass accretion rates (Macc) of the targets. From forbidden emission lines we\nderive the wind properties of the targets. Comparing our findings to values for\ncTTs, we find that Macc and wind properties of 80% of the TDs in our sample,\nwhich is strongly biased towards strongly accreting objects, are comparable to\nthose of cTTs. Thus, there are (at least) some TDs with Macc compatible with\nthose of cTTs, irrespective of the size of the dust inner hole.Only in 2 cases\nMacc are much lower, while the wind properties are similar. We do not see any\nstrong trend of Macc with the size of the dust depleted cavity, nor with the\npresence of a dusty optically thick disk close to the star. In the TDs in our\nsample there is a gas rich inner disk with density similar to that of cTTs\ndisks. At least for some TDs, the process responsible of the inner disk\nclearing should allow for a transfer of gas from the outer disk to the inner\nregion. This should proceed at a rate that does not depend on the physical\nmechanism producing the gap seen in the dust emission and results in a gas\ndensity in the inner disk similar to that of unperturbed disks around stars of\nsimilar mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 16:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

A\nbound-state S-Matrix embedded in a unique weak coupling massless SU(5) field\ntheory emerges. The states and interactions of the Standard Model are enhanced,\nand the underlying SU(5) unification suppressed, by a wee parton divergence\nphenomenon involving wee gauge bosons coupled to S-Matrix massless fermion\nanomalies. Confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, the parton model, electroweak\nsymmetry breaking, dark matter, and neutrino masses, all appear to be present.\nMost significantly, perhaps, there is a Higgs boson but, as seen experimentally\nat the LHC, there is no new short-distance physics. The only new physics is\nelectroweak-scale QCD interactions due to color sextet quarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 16:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-06"}

We prove that BCP is satisfied by the homogeneous\ndistances whose unit ball centered at the origin coincides with an Euclidean\nball.

A key issue pertaining to the robustness of the bounce and the\nassociated physics is to understand the quantum evolution for more general\ninitial states which may depart significantly from Gaussianity and may have no\nwell defined peakedness properties. The analysis of such states, including\nsqueezed and highly non-Gaussian states, has been computationally challenging\nuntil now. In this manuscript, we overcome these challenges by using the\nChimera scheme for the spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic model sourced\nwith a massless scalar field. We demonstrate that the quantum bounce in this\nmodel occurs even for states which are highly squeezed or are non-Gaussian with\nmultiple peaks and with little resemblance to semi-classical states. The\nexistence of the bounce is found to be robust, being independent of the\nproperties of the states. The evolution of squeezed and non-Gaussian states\nturns out to be qualitatively similar to that of Gaussian states, and satisfies\nstrong constraints on the growth of the relative fluctuations across the\nbounce. We also compare the results from the effective dynamics and find that,\nalthough it captures the qualitative aspects of the evolution for squeezed and\nhighly non-Gaussian states, it always underestimates the bounce volume. We show\nthat various properties of the evolution, such as the energy density at the\nbounce, are in excellent agreement with the predictions from an exactly\nsolvable loop quantum cosmological model for arbitrary states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 19:20:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 19:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-09"}

To investigate this\ncorrelation, we use a phenomenological model that successfully describes star\nformation rates, luminosities and stellar masses of star forming galaxies,\napplying it to GRB production. We predict luminosities, stellar masses, and\nmetallicities of host galaxies depending on the metallicity bias. Our\nbest-fitting model includes a moderate metallicity bias, broadly consistent\nwith the large majority of long-duration GRBs in metal-poor environments\noriginating from collapsars (probability ~83%), but with a secondary\ncontribution (~17%) from metal-independent production channels, such as binary\nevolution. Because of the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies, the maximum\nlikelihood model predicts that the metal-independent channel becomes dominant\nat z<2, where hosts have higher metallicities and collapsars are suppressed.\nThis possibly explains why some studies find no clear evidence of a metal-bias\nbased on low-z samples. However, while metallicity predictions match\nobservations well at high redshift, there is tension with low redshift\nobservations, since a significant fraction of GRB hosts are predicted to have\n(near-)solar metallicity. This is in contrast to observations, unless obscured,\nmetal-rich hosts are preferentially missed in current datasets, and suggests\nthat lower efficiencies of the metal-independent GRB channel might be preferred\nfollowing a comprehensive fit from complete samples.

An objective function surface is constructed using an interpolation\nof pairwise distances at each discretization point along the path and the\nnudged elastic band method then used to find an optimal path on this image\ndependent pair potential (IDPP) surface. This provides an initial path for the\nmore computationally intensive calculations of the true minimum energy path\nusing some method of choice for evaluating the energy and atomic forces, for\nexample by ab initio or density functional theory. The optimal path on the IDPP\nsurface is significantly closer to the true minimum energy path than a linear\ninterpolation of the Cartesian coordinates and, therefore, reduces the number\nof iterations needed to reach convergence and averts divergence in the\nelectronic structure calculations when atoms are brought too close to each\nother in the initial path. The method is illustrated with three examples: (1)\nrotation of a methyl group in an ethane molecule, (2) an exchange of atoms in\nan island on a crystal surface, and (3) an exchange of two Si-atoms in\namorphous silicon. In all three cases, the computational effort in finding the\nminimum energy path with DFT was reduced by a factor ranging from 50 % to an\norder of magnitude by using an IDPP path as the initial path.

Converting flux units to a\nbrightness temperature we interpret this to mean that the secondary is ~ 50 K\nwarmer than the primary in regions dominated by condensate grain scattering.\nOne plausible explanation for this difference is that Luhman 16B has thinner\nclouds or patchy holes in its atmosphere allowing us to see to deeper, hotter\nregions. We also detect comparably strong FeH in the 0.9896 {\\mu}m Wing-Ford\nband for both components. Traditionally, a signpost of changing atmosphere\nconditions from late-type L to early T dwarfs, the persistence and similarity\nof FeH at 0.9896 {\\mu}m in both Luhman 16A and Luhman 16B is an indication of\nhomogenous atmosphere conditions.

The energy of Hawking radiation in the\ninterior of the collapsing star is negative and equal in magnitude to its value\nat future infinity. This work investigates the backreaction of Hawking\nradiation on the interior of a gravitationally collapsing star, in a\nHartle-Hawking initial vacuum.

That is, the star bounces instead of collapsing to a black hole. A\ntrapped surface near the last stage of the star's collapse to its minimum size\nmay still exist temporarily.

The variation of the\ngravitational potential energies of the particles resulting from their descents\nin the gel coupled with the superposition principle of Nicolson allow a fair\nestimation of the distance dependent attractive energy of the particles. This\nenergy follows a modified Bessel function of the second kind with a\ncharacteristic elastocapillary decay length that decreases with the elasticity\nof the medium.

When coupled oscillators exhibit relatively weak,\nintermittent synchrony, the trajectory in the phase space spends a substantial\nfraction of time away from a vicinity of a synchronized state. Thus to describe\nand understand the observed dynamics one may consider both synchronized\nepisodes and desynchronized episodes (the episodes when oscillators are not\nsynchronous).

Here we investigate the stitching\nbetween grains of polycrystalline graphene, specifically, overlapping of layers\nat the boundaries, grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and subsequently\ndoped by the oxidized Cu substrate. We analyze overlapped regions between 60\nand 220 nm wide via Raman spectroscopy, and find that some of these overlapped\nboundaries contain AB stacked bilayers. The Raman spectra from the overlapped\ngrain boundaries are distinctly different from bilayer graphene and exhibit\nsplitting of the G band peak. The degree of splitting, peak widths, as well as\npeak intensities depend on the width of the overlap. We attribute these\nfeatures to inhomogeneous doping by charge carriers (holes) across the\noverlapped regions via the oxidized Cu substrate. As a result, the Fermi level\nat the overlapped grain boundaries lies between 0.3 and 0.4 eV below the charge\nneutrality point. Our results suggest an enhancement of electrical conductivity\nacross overlapped grain boundaries, similar to previously observed\nmeasurements(1). The dependence of charge distribution on the width of\noverlapping of grain boundaries may have strong implications for the growth of\nlarge-area graphene with enhanced conductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2014 01:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-09"}

Here we present a data-driven mathematical\napproach for developing antibiotic treatment plans that can reverse the\nevolution of antibiotic resistance determinants. We have generated adaptive\nlandscapes for 16 genotypes of the TEM beta-lactamase that vary from the wild\ntype genotype TEM-1 through all combinations of four amino acid substitutions.\nWe determined the growth rate of each genotype when treated with each of 15\nbeta-lactam antibiotics. By using growth rates as a measure of fitness, we\ncomputed the probability of each amino acid substitution in each beta-lactam\ntreatment using two different models named the Correlated Probability Model\n(CPM) and the Equal Probability Model (EPM). We then performed an exhaustive\nsearch through the 15 treatments for substitution paths leading from each of\nthe 16 genotypes back to the wild type TEM-1. We identified those treatment\npaths that returned the highest probabilities of selecting for reversions of\namino acid substitutions and returning TEM to the wild type state. For the CPM\nmodel, the optimized probabilities ranged between 0.6 and 1.0. For the EPM\nmodel, the optimized probabilities ranged between 0.38 and 1.0.

The framework of model-based\ncompressive sensing (model-CS) leverages additional structure in the signal and\nprescribes new recovery schemes that can reduce the number of measurements even\nfurther. However, model-CS requires an algorithm that solves the\nmodel-projection problem: given a query signal, produce the signal in the model\nthat is also closest to the query signal. Often, this optimization can be\ncomputationally very expensive. Moreover, an approximation algorithm is not\nsufficient for this optimization task. As a result, the model-projection\nproblem poses a fundamental obstacle for extending model-CS to many interesting\nmodels.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new framework that we call\napproximation-tolerant model-based compressive sensing. This framework includes\na range of algorithms for sparse recovery that require only approximate\nsolutions for the model-projection problem. In essence, our work removes the\naforementioned obstacle to model-based compressive sensing, thereby extending\nthe applicability of model-CS to a much wider class of models. We instantiate\nthis new framework for the Constrained Earth Mover Distance (CEMD) model, which\nis particularly useful for signal ensembles where the positions of the nonzero\ncoefficients do not change significantly as a function of spatial (or temporal)\nlocation. We develop novel approximation algorithms for both the maximization\nand the minimization versions of the model-projection problem via graph\noptimization techniques.

Evidence of CDW formation is found for\n0.45<x<0.93, but not for samples with x<0.44 that exhibit incommensurate\nspin-density-wave order, and in slightly overdoped samples with x=0.99. This\nsuggests the presence of two proximate zero-temperature CDW critical points at\ndoping pc1~0.08 and pc2~0.18. The CDW reflections are observed at\nincommensurate in-plane wave vectors (d_a, 0) and (0, d_b). Both decrease\nlinearly with increasing doping, in agreement with recent reports on Bi-based\nhigh-Tc superconductors, but in sharp contrast to the behavior of the 214\nfamily. The CDW intensity and correlation length exhibit maxima at p~0.12,\ncoincident with a plateau in the superconducting transition temperature Tc. The\nonset temperature of the CDW reflections depends non-monotonically on p, with a\nmaximum of~160 K for p~0.12. The RXS reflections exhibit a uniaxial intensity\nanisotropy. We further observe a depression of CDW correlations upon cooling\nbelow Tc, and (for samples with p> 0.09) an enhancement of the signal when an\nexternal magnetic field up to 6 T is applied in the superconducting state. For\nsamples with p~0.08, where prior work has revealed a field-enhancement of\nincommensurate magnetic order, the RXS signal is field-independent. This\nsupports a previously suggested scenario in which incommensurate charge and\nspin orders compete against each other, in addition to individually competing\nagainst.

The first is\nthat Dunkl processes in general converge in finite time to a scaled\nsteady-state distribution that only depends on the type of Dunkl process\nconsidered. The second is that in the freezing limit, their scaled final\nposition is fixed to a set of points called the peak set, which is the set of\npoints which maximizes their steady-state distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2014 08:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-09"}

We analyze the feasibility of a particular loading\nmechanism, active symplasmic loading, also called the polymer trap mechanism,\nwhere sucrose is transformed into heavier sugars, such as raffinose and\nstachyose, in the intermediary-type companion cells bordering the sieve\nelements in the minor veins of the phloem. Keeping the heavier sugars from\ndiffusing back requires that the plasmodesmata connecting the bundle sheath\nwith the intermediary cell act as extremely precise filters, which are able to\ndistinguish between molecules that differ by less than 20% in size. In our\nmodeling, we take into account the coupled water and sugar movement across the\nrelevant interfaces, without explicitly considering the chemical reactions\ntransforming the sucrose into the heavier sugars. Based on the available data\nfor plasmodesmata geometry, sugar concentrations and flux rates, we conclude\nthat this mechanism can in principle function. We find that the water flow\nthrough the plasmodesmata, which has not been quantified before, contributes\nonly 10-20% to the sucrose flux into the intermediary cells, while the main\npart is transported by diffusion. On the other hand, the subsequent sugar\ntranslocation into the sieve elements would very likely be carried\npredominantly by bulk water flow through the plasmodesmata.

This implies that\nthe photonic molecules can be used to generate tunable single-photon sources by\ntuning the values of the coupling strength between the cavity modes with weak\nnonlinearity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2014 11:35:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 07:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-10"}

The most powerful winds are observed at the FUor stage of\nstellar evolution. V1331 Cyg has been considered as a TTS at the pre-FUor\nstage. We analyse high-resolution spectra of V1331 Cyg collected in 1998-2007\nand 20-d series of spectra taken in 2012. For the first time the photospheric\nspectrum of the star is detected and stellar parameters are derived: spectral\ntype G7-K0 IV, mass 2.8 Msun, radius 5 Rsun, vsini < 6 km/s. The photospheric\nspectrum is highly veiled, but the amount of veiling is not the same in\ndifferent spectral lines, being lower in weak transitions and much higher in\nstrong transitions. The Fe II 5018, Mg I 5183, K I 7699 and some other lines of\nmetals are accompanied by a `shell' absorption at radial velocity of about -240\nkm/s.

For the multi-particle system we observe strong particle clustering\nonly in the latter case. The geometry and time scales related to clustering are\ndetermined from Voronoi tesselation and particle-conditioned averaging. As a\nconsequence of clustering, the average particle settling velocity is increased\nby 12% as compared to the value of an isolated sphere; such a collective effect\nis not observed in the non-clustering case. By defining a local (instantaneous)\nfluid velocity average in the vicinity of the finite-size particles it is shown\nthat the observed enhancement of the settling velocity is due to the fact that\nthe downward fluid motion (with respect to the global average) which is induced\nin the cluster regions is preferentially sampled by the particles. It is\nfurther observed that the variance of the particle velocity is strongly\nenhanced in the clustering case. With the aid of a decomposition of the\nparticle velocity it is shown that this increase is due to enhanced fluid\nvelocity fluctuations (due to clustering) in the vicinity of the particles.\nFinally, we discuss a possible explanation for the observation of a critical\nGalileo number marking the onset of clustering under dilute conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2014 12:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-02"}

New\nconstraints are now obtained both in the Solar and exoplanetary systems. Tidal\ndissipation in planets is intrinsically related to their internal structure. In\nparticular, fluid and solid layers behave differently under tidal forcing.\nTherefore, their respective dissipation reservoirs have to be compared. In this\nletter, we compute separately the contributions of the potential dense\nrocky/icy core and the convective fluid envelope of gaseous giant planets, as a\nfunction of core size and mass. We then compare the associated dissipation\nreservoirs, by evaluating the frequency-average of the imaginary part of the\nLove numbers $k^2_2$ in each region. In the case of Jupiter and Saturn-like\nplanets, we show that the viscoelastic dissipation in the core could dominate\nthe turbulent friction acting on tidal inertial waves in the envelope.

In parallel,\nthe quantum nature of the transverse electromagnetic field has spawned the\nfield of quantum imaging that encompasses technologies such as quantum ghost\nimaging and high-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD). The emergence of\nsuch quantum technologies also highlights the need for the development of\nmethods for characterizing the elusive quantum state itself. In this document,\nwe describe new technologies that use the quantum properties of light for\nsecurity. The first is a technique that extends the principles behind QKD to\nthe field of imaging. By applying the polarization-based BB84 protocol to\nindividual photons in an active imaging system, we obtained images that are\nsecure against intercept-resend jamming attacks. The second technology\npresented in this article is based on an extension of quantum ghost imaging. We\nused a holographic filtering technique to build a quantum ghost image\nidentification system that uses a few pairs of photons to identify an object\nfrom a set of known objects. The third technology addressed in this document is\na high-dimensional QKD system that uses orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) modes of\nlight for encoding. Moving to a high-dimensional state space in QKD allows one\nto impress more information on each photon, as well as introduce higher levels\nof security. We discuss the development of two OAM-QKD protocols based on the\nBB84 and Ekert QKD protocols. The fourth and final technology presented in this\narticle is a relatively new technique called direct measurement that uses\nsequential weak and strong measurements to characterize a quantum state. We use\nthis technique to characterize the quantum state of a photon with a\ndimensionality of d=27, and measure its rotation in the natural basis of OAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2014 13:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-09"}

We find that there are two types\nof lattice artefact: there is an effective maximum speed with which a moving\nstring can be placed on the lattice, and a moving string also slows down, with\nthe deceleration approximately proportional to the exponential of the velocity.\nTo mitigate this, we introduce and study an improved discretisation, based on\nthe tree-level L\\\"{u}scher-Weisz action, which is found to reduce the\ndeceleration by an order of magnitude, and to increase the string speed limit\nby an amount equivalent to halving the lattice spacing.

We compare in detail classical PSO with the social-only variant\nwhere local attractors are ignored. To measure the exploration capabilities, we\ndetermine how frequently both variants return results in the neighborhood of\nthe global optimum.

It turns out that the local attractor\nsignificantly improves the exploration, but sometimes reduces the quality of\nthe exploitation.

The present work shows that median filtering is also as\neasy as piecewise sorting: we can do median filtering with one piecewise\nsorting operation and linear-time postprocessing. In particular, median\nfiltering can directly benefit from the vast literature on sorting\nalgorithms---for example, adaptive sorting algorithms imply adaptive median\nfiltering algorithms.\n  The reduction is very efficient in practice---for random inputs the\nperformance of the new sorting-based algorithm is on a par with the fastest\nheap-based algorithms, and for benign data distributions it typically\noutperforms prior algorithms.\n  The key technical idea is that we can represent the sliding window with a\npair of sorted doubly-linked lists: we delete items from one list and add items\nto the other list.

Extraordinary progress has\noccurred in recent years on two fronts: the cosmic distance ladder measurements\nat low redshift and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements at high\nredshift. The CMB is used to predict the current expansion rate through a\nbest-fit cosmological model. Complementary progress has been made with baryon\nacoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements at relatively low redshifts. While BAO\ndata do not independently determine a Hubble constant, they are important for\nconstraints on possible solutions and checks on cosmic consistency. A precise\ndetermination of the Hubble constant is of great value, but it is more\nimportant to compare the high and low redshift measurements to test our\ncosmological model. Significant tension would suggest either uncertainties not\naccounted for in the experimental estimates, or the discovery of new physics\nbeyond the standard model of cosmology. In this paper we examine in detail the\ntension between the CMB, BAO, and cosmic distance ladder data sets.

Herein,\nthe physics of the p-n junction is analyzed for low-injection conditions, when\nthe junction can be considered spatially separable into quasi-neutral and\nspace-charge regions. For the conventional planar solar cell architecture,\npreviously established one-dimensional expressions governing charge carrier\ntransport are recovered from the framework established herein. Space-charge\nregion recombination statistics are compared for planar and non-planar\ngeometries, showing variations in recombination current produced from the\nspace-charge region. In addition, planar and non-planar solar cell performance\nare simulated, based on a semi-empirical expression for short-circuit current,\ndetailing variations in charge carrier transport and efficiency as a function\nof geometry, thereby yielding insights into design criteria for solar cell\narchitectures. For the conditions considered here, the expressions for\ngeneration rate and total current are shown to universally govern any solar\ncell geometry, while recombination within the space-charge region is shown to\nbe directly dependent on the geometrical orientation of the p-n junction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 22:04:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 14:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-10"}

A phenomenologic characterization of\nthe explosion of the strange attractor has been given in terms of the behavior\nof the average maximal Lyapunov exponent ${\\bar \\lambda}$ and that of the\nfractal dimension $D_{q}$ for $q=-4$. It is shown that the building up of the\nexploding strange attractor is accompanied by a nearly linear increase of the\nmaximal average Lyapunov exponent ${\\bar \\lambda}$. A sudden jump of the\nfractal dimension $D_{-4}$ is detected when the explosion starts off from an\nattractor consisting of disjoint bunches separated by an empty phase-space\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 16:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-19"}
