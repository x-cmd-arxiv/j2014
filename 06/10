As a result, fast\nelementary reactions are not modeled explicitly, and their effect is captured\nby non-elementary reaction rate functions (e.g. Hill functions). The accuracy\nof the QSSA applied to deterministic systems depends on how well timescales are\nseparated. Recently, it has been proposed to use the non-elementary rate\nfunctions obtained via the deterministic QSSA to define propensity functions in\nstochastic simulations of biochemical networks. In this approach, termed the\nstochastic QSSA, fast reactions that are part of non-elementary reactions are\nnot simulated, greatly reducing computation time. However, it is unclear when\nthe stochastic QSSA provides an accurate approximation of the original\nstochastic simulation. We show that, unlike the deterministic QSSA, the\nvalidity of the stochastic QSSA does not follow from timescale separation\nalone, but also depends on the sensitivity of the non-elementary reaction rate\nfunctions to changes in the slow species. The stochastic QSSA becomes more\naccurate when this sensitivity is small. Different types of QSSAs result in\nnon-elementary functions with different sensitivities, and the total QSSA\nresults in less sensitive functions than the standard or the pre-factor QSSA.\nWe prove that, as a result, the stochastic QSSA becomes more accurate when\nnon-elementary reaction functions are obtained using the total QSSA.

For a system as simple as graphene suspended atop a uniform\nsubstrate, high reflectivity from the substrate is crucial in creating a\nstanding-wave pattern, leading to a strong optical force on graphene. This\nforce is readily tunable in amplitude and direction by adjusting the suspension\nheight. In particular, repellent optical forces can levitate graphene to a\nseries of stable equilibrium heights above the substrate. One of the key\nparameters to maximize the optical force is the excitation frequency: peak\nforces are found near the scattering frequency of free carriers in graphene.\nWith a dynamically controllable Fermi level, graphene opens up new\npossibilities of tunable nanoscale optomechanical devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 17:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-10"}

Phase II starts when a central\nprotostar is formed and the evaporation from grains takes place.

While this\ndefining characteristic is held in common, its origin is different in each\ncase: for active systems, the irreversible driving forces can produce\ndynamically frozen states, while glassy systems vitrify when they get\nkinetically trapped on a rugged free energy landscape. In a mixture of active\nand glassy particles, the interplay between these two tendencies leads to novel\nphenomenology.

During the rise of the flux the\nposition angle of optical polarization rotated smoothly over more than\n300$\\deg$. At the same time, within 1$\\sigma$ uncertainty a new superluminal\nknot appeared with an apparent speed of 19.0$\\pm$0.3 c. We have very strong\nevidence for association of this knot with the multi-waveband outburst in 2011\nMarch-April. We also analyze the multi-frequency behavior of S4 0954+658 during\na number of minor outbursts from August 2008 to April 2012. We find some\nevidence of connections between at least two more superluminal ejecta and\nnear-simultaneous optical flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 19:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Sharp density gradients in either ejecta\nor ambient medium are required to produce the sudden deceleration of the\nreverse shock or the blast wave implied by the large spread in expansion ages.\nThe blast wave could have been decelerated recently by an encounter with a\nmodest density discontinuity in the ambient medium, such as found at a wind\ntermination shock, requiring strong mass loss in the progenitor. Alternatively,\nthe reverse shock might have encountered an order-of-magnitude density\ndiscontinuity within the ejecta, such as found in pulsating delayed-detonation\nType Ia models. We demonstrate that the blast wave is much more decelerated\nthan the reverse shock in these models for remnants at ages similar to\nG1.9+0.3.

The theorem states that given a set of vectors $X$\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$, for every vector in the convex hull of $X$ there exists an\n$\\varepsilon$-close (under the $p$-norm distance, for $2\\leq p < \\infty$)\nvector that can be expressed as a convex combination of at most $b$ vectors of\n$X$, where the bound $b$ depends on $\\varepsilon$ and the norm $p$ and is\nindependent of the dimension $d$. This theorem can be derived by instantiating\nMaurey's lemma, early references to which can be found in the work of Pisier\n(1981) and Carl (1985). However, in this paper we present a self-contained\nproof of this result.\n  Using this theorem we establish that in a bimatrix game with $ n \\times n$\npayoff matrices $A, B$, if the number of non-zero entries in any column of\n$A+B$ is at most $s$ then an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium of the game can be\ncomputed in time $n^{O\\left(\\frac{\\log s }{\\varepsilon^2}\\right)}$. This, in\nparticular, gives us a polynomial-time approximation scheme for Nash\nequilibrium in games with fixed column sparsity $s$. Moreover, for arbitrary\nbimatrix games---since $s$ can be at most $n$---the running time of our\nalgorithm matches the best-known upper bound, which was obtained by Lipton,\nMarkakis, and Mehta (2003).\n  The approximate Carath\\'{e}odory's theorem also leads to an additive\napproximation algorithm for the normalized densest $k$-subgraph problem.

We find that a circumbinary disk\ninitially aligned with the binary orbital plane is unstable to radiation-driven\nwarping beyond the marginally stable warping radius, which is sensitive to both\nthe ratio of vertical to horizontal shear viscosities and the mass-to-energy\nconversion efficiency. As expected, the tidal torques give no contribution to\nthe growth of warping modes but tend to align the circumbinary disk with the\norbital plane. Since the tidal torques can suppress the warping modes in the\ninner part of circumbinary disk, the circumbinary disk starts to be warped at\nradii larger than the marginally stable warping radius.

To help address this, we develop an automated method to identify\nlate-stage galaxy mergers before coalescence of the galactic cores. The\nresulting sample of mergers is distinct from those obtained using pair-finding\nand morphological indicators. Our method relies on median-filtering of\nhigh-resolution images in order to distinguish two concentrated galaxy nuclei\nat small separations. Using mock images, we derive statistical contamination\nand incompleteness corrections for the fraction of late-stage mergers. We apply\nour new method to a magnitude-limited (I < 23) sample of 44,164 galaxies from\nthe COSMOS HST/ACS catalog. Using a mass-complete sample with $\\log M_*/M_\\odot\n> 10.6$ and $0.25 < z \\leq 1.00$, we find ~5% of systems are late-stage mergers\nwith separations between 2.2 and 8 kpc. Correcting for incompleteness and\ncontamination, the fractional merger rate increases strongly with redshift as\n$(1+z)^{3.8\\pm0.9}$, in agreement with earlier studies and with dark matter\nhalo merger rates. Separating the sample into star-forming and quiescent\ngalaxies shows that the merger rate for star-forming galaxies increases\nstrongly redshift, $(1+z)^{4.5\\pm1.3}$, while the merger rate for quiescent\ngalaxies is consistent with no evolution, $(1+z)^{1.1\\pm1.2}$. Limiting our\nsample to galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from zCOSMOS, we find that the\nstar formation rates and X-ray selected AGN activity in likely late-stage\nmergers are enhanced by factors of ~2 relative to a control sample. Combining\nour sample with more widely separated pairs, we find that $8\\pm5\\%$ of star\nformation and $20\\pm8\\%$ of AGN activity is triggered by close encounters (<143\nkpc) or mergers, once more suggesting that major mergers are not the only\nchannels for star formation and black hole growth.

We\ncompared it with the formulae used in the literature, and pointed out the\ndifferences. Using this result, we now present three case studies - Mercury,\nKepler-10b, and a triaxial Io. A very sharp frequency-dependence of k2/Q near\nspin-orbit resonances yields a similarly sharp dependence of k2/Q on the spin\nrate. This indicates that physical libration may play a major role in tidal\nheating of synchronously rotating bodies. The magnitude of libration in the\nspin rate being defined by the planet's triaxiality, the latter should be a\nfactor determining the dissipation rate. Other parameters equal, a\nsynchronously rotating body with a stronger triaxiality should generate more\nheat than a similar body of a more symmetrical shape. Further in the paper, we\ndiscuss scenarios where initially triaxial objects melt and lose their\ntriaxiality. Thereafter, dissipation in them becomes less intensive; so the\nbodies freeze. The tidal bulge becomes a new permanent figure, with a new\ntriaxiality lower than the original. In the paper, we also derive simplified,\napproximate expressions for dissipation rate in a rocky planet of the Maxwell\nrheology, with a not too small Maxwell time. The three expressions derived\npertain to the cases of a synchronous spin, a 3:2 resonance, and a nonresonant\nrotation; so they can be applied to most close-in super-Earth exoplanets\ndetected thus far. In such bodies, the rate of tidal heating outside of\nsynchronous rotation is weakly dependent on the eccentricity and obliquity,\nprovided both these parameters are small or moderate. According to our\ncalculation, Kepler-10b could hardly survive the great amount of tidal heating\nwithout being synchronised, circularised and also reshaped through a complete\nor partial melt-down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 20:53:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 11:31:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 17:22:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 23:45:48 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 18:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-09"}

This paper studies the relationship between the\nLSC and environment-based abstract machines. While traditional calculi with ES\nsimulate abstract machines, the LSC rather distills them: some transitions are\nsimulated while others vanish, as they map to a notion of structural\ncongruence. The distillation process unveils that abstract machines in fact\nimplement weak linear head reduction, a notion of evaluation having a central\nrole in the theory of linear logic.

The\nconstruction of the next generation detector, XENON1T, is presently taking\nplace at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) in Italy. It aims at a\nsensitivity to spin-independent cross sections of $2 \\cdot 10^{-47} ~\n\\mathrm{cm}^{\\mathrm{2}}$ for WIMP masses around 50 GeV/c$^{2}$, which requires\na background reduction by two orders of magnitude compared to XENON100, the\ncurrent generation detector. An active system that is able to tag muons and\nmuon-induced backgrounds is critical for this goal. A water Cherenkov detector\nof $\\sim$10 m height and diameter has been therefore developed, equipped with 8\ninch photomultipliers and cladded by a reflective foil. We present the design\nand optimization study for this detector, which has been carried out with a\nseries of Monte Carlo simulations. The muon veto will reach very high detection\nefficiencies for muons ($>99.5%$) and showers of secondary particles from muon\ninteractions in the rock ($>70%$). Similar efficiencies will be obtained for\nXENONnT, the upgrade of XENON1T, which will later improve the WIMP sensitivity\nby another order of magnitude. With the Cherenkov water shield studied here,\nthe background from muon-induced neutrons in XENON1T is negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 22:06:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 16:54:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-26"}

We formulate this as a landmark\nidentification problem, where a set of landmarks specifies the boundaries of\nthe parts. A novel mixture of graphical models is proposed, which dynamically\ncouples the landmarks to a hierarchy of segments. When modeling pairwise\nrelation between landmarks, this coupling enables our model to exploit the\nlocal image contents in addition to spatial deformation, an aspect that most\nexisting graphical models ignore. In particular, our model enforces appearance\nconsistency between segments within the same part. Parsing the car, including\nfinding the optimal coupling between landmarks and segments in the hierarchy,\nis performed by dynamic programming. We evaluate our method on a subset of\nPASCAL VOC 2010 car images and on the car subset of 3D Object Category dataset\n(CAR3D).

The standard solar model fails to predict the very low lithium\nabundance in the Sun, which is much lower than the proto-solar nebula. This Li\nproblem has been debated for decades, and it has been ascribed either to planet\nformation or to secular stellar depletion. In order to test the evolution of\nLi, it is important to find solar twins in a range of ages. Also, the study of\nstars similar to the Sun is relevant in relation to the signature of\nterrestrial planet formation around the Sun. [Methods]. We acquired\nhigh-resolution (R=110,000), high S/N (~300) ESO/VLT UVES spectra of several\nsolar twin candidates and the Sun (as reflected from the asteroid Juno). Among\nthe solar twin candidates we identify HIP 114328 as a solar twin and perform a\ndifferential line-by-line abundance analysis of this star relative to the Sun.\n[Results]. HIP 114328 has stellar parameters Teff = 5785+/-10 K, log g =\n4.38+/-0.03, [Fe/H] = -0.022+/-0.009, and a microturbulent velocity 0.05+/-0.03\nkm/s higher than solar. The differential analysis shows that this star is\nchemically very similar to the Sun. The refractory elements seem even slightly\nmore depleted than in the Sun, meaning that HIP 114328 may be as likely to form\nterrestrial planets as the Sun. HIP 114328 is about 2 Gyr older than the Sun,\nand is thus the second oldest solar twin analyzed at high precision. It has a\nLi abundance of A(Li)NLTE <= 0.46, which is about 4 times lower than in the Sun\n(A(Li)NLTE = 1.07 dex), but close to the oldest solar twin known, HIP 102152.\n[Conclusions]. Based on the lower abundances of refractory elements when\ncompared to other solar twins, HIP 114328 seems an excellent candidate to host\nrocky planets. The low Li abundance of this star is consistent with its old age\nand fits very well the emerging Li-age relation among solar twins of different\nages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 23:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-09"}

Two main groups of theories were proposed to explain the\nsupposed discrepancy--first, the most commonly accepted, is the suggestion of\nthe existence of large non-baryonic dark matter halo, and, second are theories\nadvocating some modification to the law of gravity. So far however, there is no\nempirical evidence for either dark matter or modified gravity.

Transition to global chaos is accompanied by smearing of these\npatterns; however, some of their traces survive on relatively long timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 05:39:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2015 05:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-09"}

These nanostructured materials strongly attenuate light in a broad\nwavelength interval ranged from 400 nm to 5 um but exhibit a narrow\ntransparency window centered at a given wavelength. The main elements are\nnanorods and nano-crosses of variable sizes. The nanomaterial can be designed\nas a solution, nanocomposite film, metastructure or aerosol. The principle of\nthe formation of the transparency window in the abroad extinction spectrum is\nbased on the narrow lines of longitudinal plasmons of single nanorods and\nnanorod complexes. To realize the spectrum with a transmission window, we\ndesign a nanocomposite material as a mixture of nanorods of different sizes.\nSimultaneously, we exclude nanorods of certain length from the nanorod\nensemble. The width of the plasmonic transparency window is determined by the\nintrinsic and radiative broadenings of the nanocrystal plasmons. We also\ndescribe the effect of narrowing of the transparency window with increasing the\nconcentration of nanocrystals. Two well-established technologies can be used to\nfabricate such nano- and metamaterials, the colloidal synthesis and\nlithography.

Generally, the source localization process involves a\nhigh-dimensional inverse problem that has an infinite number of solutions and\nthus requires additional constraints to be considered to have a unique\nsolution. In the context of EEG source localization, we propose a novel\napproach that is based on dividing the cerebral cortex of the brain into a\nfinite number of Functional Zones which correspond to unitary functional areas\nin the brain. In this paper we investigate the use of Brodmanns areas as the\nFunctional Zones. This approach allows us to apply a sparsity constraint to\nfind a unique solution for the inverse EEG problem. Compared to previously\npublished algorithms which use different sparsity constraints to solve this\nproblem, the proposed method is potentially more consistent with the known\nsparsity profile of the human brain activity and thus may be able to ensure\nbetter localization.

The bias is\nrepresented as the probability $p$ of the particle to travel along the shortest\npath to the target node. The efficiency of the transmission process is\nexpressed through the fraction $f_g$ of particles that succeed to reach the\ntarget without being trapped. By relating $f_g$ with the number $S$ of nodes\nvisited before reaching the target, we firstly show that, for the unbiased\nrandom walk, $f_g$ is inversely proportional to both the concentration $c$ of\ntraps and the size $N$ of the network. For the case of biased walks, a simple\napproximation of $S$ provides an analytical solution that describes well the\nbehavior of $f_g$, especially for $p>0.5$. Also, it is shown that for a given\nvalue of the bias $p$, when the concentration of traps is less than a threshold\nvalue equal to the inverse of the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) between two\nrandomly chosen nodes of the network, the efficiency of transmission is\nunaffected by the presence of traps and almost all the particles arrive at the\ntarget.

This loss of regularity is interesting because it occurs\nregardless of whether the less viscous fluid is displacing the more viscous\nfluid, or vice versa. We show that small contracting bubbles are described to\nleading order by a well-studied geometric flow rule. Exact solutions to this\nasymptotic problem continue past the corner formation until the bubble\ncontracts to a point as a slit in the limit.

In particular, biochemical cycles - the\nbuilding-blocks of biochemical systems - require a source of energy to\nfunction. However, although fundamental, the role of chemical potential and\nGibb's free energy in the analysis of biochemical systems is often overlooked\nleading to models which are physically impossible. The bond graph approach was\ndeveloped for modelling engineering systems where energy generation, storage\nand transmission are fundamental. The method focuses on how power flows between\ncomponents and how energy is stored, transmitted or dissipated within\ncomponents. Based on early ideas of network thermodynamics, we have applied\nthis approach to biochemical systems to generate models which automatically\nobey the laws of thermodynamics. We illustrate the method with examples of\nbiochemical cycles. We have found that thermodynamically compliant models of\nsimple biochemical cycles can easily be developed using this approach. In\nparticular, both stoichiometric information and simulation models can be\ndeveloped directly from the bond graph. Furthermore, model reduction and\napproximation while retaining structural and thermodynamic properties is\nfacilitated. Because the bond graph approach is also modular and scaleable, we\nbelieve that it provides a secure foundation for building thermodynamically\ncompliant models of large biochemical networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 07:25:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2014 05:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

They help address the\nquestion of whether there is evidence for global, flow-like, azimuthal\ncorrelations in the p-Pb system. Comparisons are made to measurements from the\nlarger Pb-Pb system, where such evidence is established. In particular, the\nsecond harmonic two-particle cumulants are found to decrease with multiplicity,\ncharacteristic of a dominance of few-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions.\nHowever, when a $|\\Delta \\eta|$ gap is placed to suppress such correlations,\nthe two-particle cumulants begin to rise at high-multiplicity, indicating the\npresence of global azimuthal correlations. The Pb-Pb values are higher than the\np-Pb values at similar multiplicities. In both systems, the second harmonic\nfour-particle cumulants exhibit a transition from positive to negative values\nwhen the multiplicity increases.

The\nsolution fully computed in the framework of classical fluid-mechanics allows\nthis regime to be identified and the accuracy of the approximating scaling laws\nproposed to describe the propagation of the bridge to be established. It is\nshown that the scaling law known for this regime has a very limited region of\naccuracy and, as a result, in describing experimental data it has frequently\nbeen applied outside its limits of applicability. The origin of the scaling\nlaw's shortcoming appears to be the fact that it accounts for the capillary\npressure due only to the longitudinal curvature of the free surface as the\ndriving force for the process. To address this deficiency, the scaling law is\nextended to account for both the longitudinal and azimuthal curvatures at the\nbridge front which, fortuitously, still results in an explicit analytic\nexpression for the front's propagation speed. This new expression is then shown\nto offer an excellent approximation for both the fully-computed solution and\nfor experimental data from a range of flow configurations for a remarkably\nlarge proportion of the coalescence process.

Further, the whole moat is a downflow region, while the\nsupergranule contains the upflow in the centre, which turns into the downflow\nat some 60 % of the cell radius from its centre. We estimate that the mass\ndownflow rate in the moat region is at least two times larger than the mass\ncirculation rate within the supergranular cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 09:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

These sources were originally included in\na list of candidate classical Cepheids (CCs) extracted from the EROS-2\ncatalogue on the basis of the period (0.89 $<P_{EROS}<$15.85 days) versus\nluminosity ($13.39 < \\langle B_{EROS}\\rangle<17.82$ mag) diagram. After visual\ninspection of the light curves we reclassified them as eclipsing binaries. They\nhave blue colours ($B_{EROS} - R_{EROS} < $ 0.2 mag) hence we classed them as\nhot eclipsing binaries (HEBs) containing hot massive components: main sequence\n(MS) stars or blue giants. We present $K_{\\rm s}$-band light curves for 999\nbinaries from our sample that have a counterpart in the VISTA near-infrared ESO\npublic survey of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC). We provide spectral\nclassifications of 13 HEBs with existing spectroscopy. We divided our sample\ninto contact-like binaries and detached/semi-detached systems based on both\nvisual inspection and the parameters of the Fourier decomposition of the light\ncurves and analysed the period-luminosity ($PL$) relations of the contact-like\nsystems using the $R_{EROS}$ and $K_{\\rm s}$ magnitudes at maximum light. The\ncontact-like binaries in our sample do not follow $PL$ relations. We analysed\nthe sample of contact binaries from the OGLE III catalogue and confirmed that\n$PL_I$ and $PL_{K_{\\rm s}}$ sequences are defined only by eclipsing binaries\ncontaining a red giant component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 10:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The CLE's main disadvantage is its\nbreak down in finite time due to the problem of evaluating square roots of\nnegative quantities whenever the molecule numbers become sufficiently small. We\nshow that this issue is not a numerical integration problem, rather in many\nsystems it is intrinsic to all representations of the CLE. Various methods of\ncorrecting the CLE have been proposed which avoid its break down. We show that\nthese methods introduce undesirable artefacts in the CLE's predictions. In\nparticular, for unimolecular systems, these correction methods lead to CLE\npredictions for the mean concentrations and variance of fluctuations which\ndisagree with those of the chemical master equation. We show that, by extending\nthe domain of the CLE to complex space, break down is eliminated, and the CLE's\naccuracy for unimolecular systems is restored. Although the molecule numbers\nare generally complex, we show that the \"complex CLE\" predicts real-valued\nquantities for the mean concentrations, the moments of intrinsic noise, power\nspectra and first passage times, hence admitting a physical interpretation. It\nis also shown to provide a more accurate approximation of the chemical master\nequation of simple biochemical circuits involving bimolecular reactions than\nthe various corrected forms of the real-valued CLE, the linear-noise\napproximation and a commonly used two moment-closure approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 10:50:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 14:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

Because\nthe problem is NP-hard in general, it is common to replace the matrix rank with\nthe nuclear norm, which acts as a convenient convex surrogate. While elegant\ntheoretical conditions elucidate when this replacement is likely to be\nsuccessful, they are highly restrictive and convex algorithms fail when the\nambient rank is too high or when the constraint set is poorly structured.\nNon-convex alternatives fare somewhat better when carefully tuned; however,\nconvergence to locally optimal solutions remains a continuing source of\nfailure. Against this backdrop we derive a deceptively simple and\nparameter-free probabilistic PCA-like algorithm that is capable, over a wide\nbattery of empirical tests, of successful recovery even at the theoretical\nlimit where the number of measurements equal the degrees of freedom in the\nunknown low-rank matrix. Somewhat surprisingly, this is possible even when the\naffine constraint set is highly ill-conditioned. While proving general recovery\nguarantees remains evasive for non-convex algorithms, Bayesian-inspired or\notherwise, we nonetheless show conditions whereby the underlying cost function\nhas a unique stationary point located at the global optimum; no existing cost\nfunction we are aware of satisfies this same property.

We find that the object exhibits two distinct modes of\nemission; a strong mode with a broad profile and a weak mode with a narrow\nprofile. During the strong mode of emission, the pulsar typically radiates very\nenergetic emission over sequences of ~200-6000 pulses (~60 s-24 min), with\napparent nulls over time-scales of up to a few pulses at a time. Emission\nduring the weak mode is observed outside of these strong-mode sequences and\nmanifests as occasional bursts of up to a few clearly detectable pulses at a\ntime, as well as low-level underlying emission which is only detected through\nprofile integration. This implies that the previously described null mode may\nin fact be representative of the bottom-end of the pulse intensity distribution\nfor the source. This is supported by the dramatic pulse-to-pulse intensity\nmodulation and rarity of exceptionally bright pulses observed during both modes\nof emission. Coupled with the fact that the source could be interpreted as a\nrotating radio transient (RRAT)-like object for the vast majority of the time,\nif placed at a further distance, we advance that this object likely represents\na bridge between RRATs and extreme moding pulsars. Further to these emission\nproperties, we also show that the source is consistent with being a\nnear-aligned rotator and that it does not exhibit any measurable spin-down rate\nvariation. These results suggest that nulls observed in other intermittent\nobjects may in fact be representative of very weak emission without the need\nfor complete cessation. As such, we argue that longer (> 1 h) observations of\npulsars are required to discern their true modulation properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 11:24:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Unfortunately, it was\nrecently proved [F\\\"ugger et al., ASYNC'13] that no existing binary-valued\ncircuit model proposed so far, including the two most commonly used pure and\ninertial delay channels, faithfully captures glitch propagation: For the simple\nShort-Pulse Filtration (SPF) problem, which is related to a circuit's ability\nto suppress a single glitch, we showed that the quite broad class of bounded\nsingle-history channels either contradict the unsolvability of SPF in bounded\ntime or the solvability of SPF in unbounded time in physical circuits.\n  In this paper, we propose a class of binary circuit models that do not suffer\nfrom this deficiency: Like bounded single-history channels, our involution\nchannels involve delays that may depend on the time of the previous output\ntransition. Their characteristic property are delay functions which are based\non involutions, i.e., functions that form their own inverse. A concrete example\nof such a delay function, which is derived from a generalized first-order\nanalog circuit model, reveals that this is not an unrealistic assumption. We\nprove that, in sharp contrast to what is possible with bounded single-history\nchannels, SPF cannot be solved in bounded time due to the nonexistence of a\nlower bound on the delay of involution channels, whereas it is easy to provide\nan unbounded SPF implementation. It hence follows that binary-valued circuit\nmodels based on involution channels allow to solve SPF precisely when this is\npossible in physical circuits.

Recent metallicity determinations in young open clusters and\nstar-forming regions suggest that the latter may be characterized by a slightly\nlower metallicity than the Sun and older clusters in the solar vicinity.\nHowever, these results are based on small statistics and inhomogeneous\nanalyses. The Gaia-ESO Survey is observing and homogeneously analyzing large\nsamples of stars in several young clusters and star-forming regions, hence\nallowing us to further investigate this issue.\n  Aims. We present a new metallicity determination of the Chamaeleon I\nstar-forming region, based on the products distributed in the first internal\nrelease of the Gaia-ESO Survey.\n  Methods. 48 candidate members of Chamaeleon I have been observed with the\nhigh-resolution spectrograph UVES. We use the surface gravity, lithium line\nequivalent width and position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to confirm the\ncluster members and we use the iron abundance to derive the mean metallicity of\nthe region.\n  Results.

As an interesting\ncandidate to accommodate light Higgs, in this paper we adopt the scenario of\ndimensional deconstruction, where Higgs is redarded as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone\nboson.

We point\nout that in this scenario Higgs interaction with matter field is anomalous,\ni.e. its coupling deviates from what the standard model predicts. The interplay\nbetween the periodicity of physical observables in the Higgs field and the\nviolation of translational invariance along the extra-space due to the\nlatticization is argued to play an essential role to get the anomalous\ninteraction. Though the predicted anomalous Higgs interaction has much\nsimilarity to the one in the gauge-Higgs unification, in the case of\ndimensional deconstruction the anomaly exists even if we do not introduce bulk\nmass term for the chiral fermion realized by orbifolding, in clear contrast to\nthe case of gauge-Higgs unification.

The\nNMR investigations demonstrate, that the samples are obtained with a partial\ncarbonization of initial aromatic compounds and do not reach a state of glassy\ncarbon. The magnetization, longitudinal nonlinear response to a weak ac field\nand electron magnetic resonance data give evidences for presence of FM clusters\nin the samples well above 300 K. A short-range character of the FM ordering in\nthe Au-doped sample transforms below T$_C \\approx$ 210 K into another\ninhomogeneous FM state. Besides the FM clusters, this state contains a\nsubsystem with a long-range FM ordering (matrix) formed by paramagnetic\ncenters, existing outside the clusters. The nonlinear response data suggest a\npercolative character of the long-range FM matrix, which is connected probably\nwith a porous sample structure. The magnetization data give evidence for the\nformation of an inhomogeneous state in the Co-doped sample, similar to that in\nthe Au-doped one. However, this state is formed at higher temperatures, lying\nwell above 350 K, and exhibits a more homogeneous arrangement of the FM\nnanoparticles and the FM matrix.

Such peculiarity is absent in the Co-doped sample below 350 K, which\nis in agreement with formation of the FM state in this sample at much higher\ntemperatures. Further cooling below T ~ 3(10) K leads to a steep increase of\nthe magnetization in both samples. This is attributable to the domain\nrearrangement in the inhomogeneous FM state at low temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 13:57:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 10:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-12"}

The\nformalism, which is modified in the hot and dense medium to account for Pauli\nblocking effects, mean-field binding on baryons, and pion and kaon\nself-energies, has been improved to implement full unitarization and\nself-consistency for both the $s$- and $p$-wave interactions at finite\ntemperature and density. This gives access to in-medium amplitudes in several\nelastic and inelastic coupled channels with strangeness content $S=-1$.

Thus, the blue-shifted outflow is probably deflected\nby the interaction with dense gas along the line of sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 15:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

The primary profession of\nthe Banjaras was trade, based on the large-scale movement of goods over long\ndistances, but their services were taken over by the railways about one hundred\nyears ago. Since then the Banjaras have begun the long journey to a sedentary\nlifestyle.
