Here we establish a computational\nquantum-classical boundary from the viewpoint of classical simulatability of a\nquantum system under decoherence. Specifically, we consider commuting quantum\ncircuits being subject to decoherence. Or equivalently, we can regard them as\nmeasurement-based quantum computation on decohered weighted graph states. To\nshow intractability of classical simulation above the boundary, we utilize the\npostselection argument introduced by M. J. Bremner, R. Jozsa, and D.

We found that when each qubit is subject to a\nsingle-qubit complete-positive-trace-preserving noise, the computational\nquantum-classical boundary is sharply given by the noise rate required for the\ndistillability of a magic state. The obtained quantum-classical boundary of\nnoisy quantum dynamics reveals a complexity landscape of controlled quantum\nsystems.

Earlier experiments in the\nmass region A=190-200 close to the beta-stability line, using the (p,f) and\n(\\alpha,f) reactions, observed a more symmetric distribution of fission\nfragments. While the beta-delayed fission of 180Hg can be associated with\nrelatively low excitation energy, this is not the case for light-ion reactions,\nwhich result in warm compound nuclei. Purpose: To elucidate the roles of proton\nand neutron numbers and excitation energy in determining symmetric and\nasymmetric fission yields, we compute and analyze the isentropic potential\nenergy surfaces of 174,180,198Hg and 196,210Po. Methods: We use the\nfinite-temperature superfluid nuclear density functional theory, for excitation\nenergies up to E*=30MeV and zero angular momentum. For our theoretical\nframework, we consider the Skyrme energy density functional SkM* and a\ndensity-dependent pairing interaction. Results: For 174,180Hg, we predict\nfission pathways consistent with asymmetric fission at low excitation energies,\nwith the symmetric fission pathway opening very gradually as excitation energy\nis increased. For 198Hg and 196Po, we expect the nearly-symmetric fission\nchannel to dominate. 210Po shows a preference for a slightly asymmetric pathway\nat low energies, and a preference for a symmetric pathway at high energies.\nConclusions: Our self-consistent theory suggests that excitation energy weakly\naffects the fission pattern of the nuclei considered. The transition from the\nasymmetric fission in the proton-rich nuclei to a more symmetric fission in the\nheavier isotopes is governed by the shell structure of pre-scission\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 17:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

In this framework the SUSY breaking Lagrangian takes the most general\nform consistent with a grand unified symmetry such as SO(10) and a non-Abelian\nflavor symmetry acting on the three families with either a 2+1 or a 3 family\nassignment. Models based on gauged SU(2) and SO(3) flavor symmetry, as well as\nnon-Abelian discrete symmetries such as S_3 and A_4, have been suggested which\nfall into this category. These models describe supersymmetry breaking in terms\nof seven phenomenological parameters. The soft supersymmetry breaking masses at\nM_GUT of all sfermions of the first two families are equal in sMSSM, which\ndiffer in general from the corresponding third family mass. In such a framework\nwe show that the muon g-2 anomaly, the observed Higgs boson mass of ~ 125 GeV,\nand the observed relic neutralino dark matter abundance can be simultaneously\naccommodated. The resolution of the muon g-2 anomaly in particular yields the\nresult that the first two generation squark masses, as well the gluino mass,\nshould be <~ 2 TeV, which will be tested at LHC14.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 18:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-27"}

This\nsuggests that new QKD protocols may exist with higher secret key rates and\neffective ranges larger than the metro-area limits of BB84 QKD over optical\nfiber. In this paper we illustrate such a possibility with a new protocol\ncalled Amplified Quantum Key Distribution (AQKD), which will be compatible with\nthe optical amplification typically encountered on inter-city fiber spans. We\nanalyze one instantiation of AQKD, in which the transmitter enclave contains an\noptical amplifier (OA), with security against passive optical tapping. For this\nscenario AQKD is shown to: give three times the secret key rate of BB84 at\nspans up to 100km, increasing to more than a ten-fold gain at 140km; and double\nthe maximum single-span optical fiber transmission range to inter-city\ndistances (300km). Essential to these performance gains is a new\ninformation-theoretic protocol post-processing stage called generalized\nadvantage distillation (GAD). AQKD could be implemented with commercial\noff-the-shelf (COTS) hardware as an augmentation of present-day BB84 QKD. AQKD\navoids the expense, complexity and resource duplication of \"trusted relay\"\napproaches to QKD range extension.

Since the function $f(\\mathcal{R})$ is\nnot known \\emph{a priori}, the need of a model independent reconstruction of\nits shape represents a relevant technique to determine which $f(\\mathcal{R})$\nmodel is really favored with respect to others. To this aim, we relate\ncosmography to a generic $f(\\mathcal R)$ and its derivatives in order to\nprovide a model independent investigation at redshift $z \\sim 0$. Our analysis\nis based on the use of three different cosmological distance definitions, in\norder to alleviate the duality problem, i.e. the problem of which cosmological\ndistance to use with specific cosmic data sets. We therefore consider the\nluminosity, $d_L$, flux, $d_F$, and angular, $d_A$, distances and we find\nnumerical constraints by the Union 2.1 supernovae compilation and measurement\nof baryonic acoustic oscillations, at $z_{BAO}=0.35$.

Thus, to fix the cosmographic series of observables, we\nimpose the initial value of $H_0$ by fitting $\\mathcal H_0$ through supernovae\nonly, in the redshift regime $z<0.4$.

In\norder to accomplish this aim, it is pivotal to understand how\nspin-supercurrents interact dynamically with magnetization textures. We\ninvestigate the appearance of a spin-supercurrent and the resulting\nmagnetization dynamics in a textured magnetic Josephson current by using three\nexperimentally relevant models: i) a S/F/S junction with spin-active\ninterfaces, ii) a S/F1/F2/F3/S Josephson junction with a ferromagnetic\ntrilayer, and iii) a Josephson junction containing a domain wall. In all of\nthese cases, the supercurrent is spin-polarized and exerts a spin-transfer\ntorque on the ferromagnetic interlayers which causes magnetization dynamics.\nUsing a scattering matrix formalism in the clean limit, we compute the\nAndreev-bound states and free energy of the system which is used to solve the\nLandau-Lifshiftz-Gilbert equation. We compute both how the inhomogeneous\nmagnetism influences the phase-dependence of the charge supercurrent as well as\nthe magnetization dynamics caused by the spin-supercurrent. Using a realistic\nexperimental parameter set, we find that the supercurrent can induce\nmagnetization switching that is controlled by the superconducting phase\ndifference. Moreover, we demonstrate that the combined effect of chiral spin\nsymmetry breaking and interface scattering causes the system to act as a phase\nbattery that may supply any superconducting phase difference phi in the ground\nstate. Such a phi junction is accompanied by an anomalous supercurrent\nappearing even at zero phase difference, and we demonstrate that the flow\ndirection of this current is controlled by the chirality of the magnetization\nconfiguration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 20:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

That such large SMBHs\nformed so early in the Universe remains an open theoretical problem. One\npossibility is that gas in atomic cooling halos exposed to strong Lyman-Werner\n(LW) radiation forms $10^4-10^6 ~ M_\\odot$ supermassive stars which quickly\ncollapse into black holes. We propose a scenario for direct collapse black hole\n(DCBH) formation based on synchronized pairs of pristine atomic cooling halos.\nWe consider halos at very small separation with one halo being a subhalo of the\nother. The first halo to surpass the atomic cooling threshold forms stars. Soon\nafter these stars are formed, the other halo reaches the cooling threshold and\ndue to its small distance from the newly formed galaxy, is exposed to the\ncritical LW intensity required to form a DCBH. The main advantage of this\nscenario is that synchronization can potentially prevent photoevaporation and\nmetal pollution in DCBH-forming halos. Since the halos reach the atomic cooling\nthreshold at nearly the same time, the DCBH-forming halo is only exposed to\nionizing radiation for a brief period. Tight synchronization could allow the\nDCBH to form before stars in the nearby galaxy reach the end of their lives and\ngenerate supernovae winds. We use N-body simulations to estimate the abundance\nof DCBHs formed in this way. The largest source of uncertainty in our estimate\nis the initial mass function (IMF) of metal free stars formed in atomic cooling\nhalos. We find that even for tight synchronization, the density of DCBHs formed\nin this scenario could explain the SMBHs implied by $z=6$ quasar observations.\nMetal pollution and photoevaporation could potentially reduce the abundance of\nDCBHs below that required to explain the observations in other models that rely\non a high LW flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 20:13:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 20:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

However, the decoding performance\nof polar codes with traditional successive-cancellation (SC) algorithm cannot\nmatch that of the low-density parity-check (LDPC) or turbo codes. Because SC\nlist (SCL) decoding algorithm can significantly improve the error-correcting\nperformance of polar codes, design of SCL decoders is important for polar codes\nto be deployed in practical applications. However, because the prior latency\nreduction approaches for SC decoders are not applicable for SCL decoders, these\nlist decoders suffer from the long latency bottleneck. In this paper, we\npropose a multi-bit-decision approach that can significantly reduce latency of\nSCL decoders. First, we present a reformulated SCL algorithm that can perform\nintermediate decoding of 2 bits together. The proposed approach, referred as\n2-bit reformulated SCL (2b-rSCL) algorithm, can reduce the latency of SCL\ndecoder from (3n-2) to (2n-2) clock cycles without any performance loss. Then,\nwe extend the idea of 2-bit-decision to general case, and propose a general\ndecoding scheme that can perform intermediate decoding of any 2K bits\nsimultaneously. This general approach, referred as 2K-bit reformulated SCL\n(2Kb-rSCL) algorithm, can reduce the overall decoding latency to as short as\nn/2K-2-2 cycles. Furthermore, based on the proposed algorithms, VLSI\narchitectures for 2b-rSCL and 4b-rSCL decoders are synthesized.

Harry\nMarkowitz's Ph.D. thesis prepared the ground for the mathematical theory of\nfinance. In modern portfolio theory, we typically find asset returns that are\nmodeled by a random variable with an elliptical distribution and the notion of\nportfolio risk is described by an appropriate risk measure. In this paper, we\npropose new stochastic models for the asset returns that are based on Jumps-\nDiffusion (J-D) distributions. This family of distributions are more compatible\nwith stylized features of asset returns. On the other hand, in the past\ndecades, we find attempts in the literature to use well-known risk measures,\nsuch as Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall, in this context. Unfortunately,\none drawback with these previous approaches is that no explicit formulas are\navailable and numerical approximations are used to solve the optimization\nproblem. In this paper, we propose to use a new coherent risk measure,\nso-called, Entropic Value at Risk(EVaR), in the optimization problem. For\ncertain models, including a jump-diffusion distribution, this risk measure\nyields an explicit formula for the objective function so that the optimization\nproblem can be solved without resorting to numerical approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 22:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-30"}

We investigate its event detection rate and its parameter accuracies\nusing Fisher analysis.

However, little work has been done on how to faithfully recover\nimage intensities from a triangulated mesh of an image, a process also known as\nimage restoration or decoding from meshes. The existing methods such as linear\ninterpolation, least-square interpolation, or interpolation based on radial\nbasis functions (RBFs) work to some extent, but often yield blurred features\n(edges, corners, etc.). The main reason for this problem is due to the\nisotropically-defined Euclidean distance that is taken into consideration in\nthese methods, without considering the anisotropicity of feature intensities in\nan image. Moreover, most existing methods use intensities defined at mesh nodes\nwhose intensities are often ambiguously defined on or near image edges (or\nfeature boundaries). In the current paper, a new method of restoring an image\nfrom its triangulation representation is proposed, by utilizing anisotropic\nradial basis functions (ARBFs). This method considers not only the geometrical\n(Euclidean) distances but also the local feature orientations (anisotropic\nintensities). Additionally, this method is based on the intensities of mesh\nfaces instead of mesh nodes and thus provides a more robust restoration. The\ntwo strategies together guarantee excellent feature-preserving restoration of\nan image with arbitrary super-resolutions from its triangulation\nrepresentation, as demonstrated by various experiments provided in the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2014 05:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-30"}

We found that Be is\nconsiderably deficient (to widely different degree from star to star) in the\nphotosphere of these evolved giants by ~1-3 dex (or more) compared to the\ninitial abundance. While the resulting Be abundances (A(Be)) appear to weakly\ndepend upon T_eff, log g, [Fe/H], M, age, and v_sin i, this may be attributed\nto the metallicity dependence of A(Be) coupled with the mutual correlation\nbetween these stellar parameters, since such tendencies almost disappear in the\nmetallicity-scaled Be abundance ([Be/Fe]). By comparing the Be abundances (as\nwell as their correlations with Li and C) to the recent theoretical predictions\nbased on sophisticated stellar evolution calculations, we concluded that such a\nconsiderable extent/diversity of Be deficit is difficult to explain only by the\nstandard theory of first dredge-up in the envelope of red giants, and that some\nextra mixing process (such as rotational or thermohaline mixing) must be\nresponsible, which presumably starts to operate already in the main-sequence\nphase.

In this work, dynamic light scattering (DLS) is employed to\nstudy the microscopic dynamics of the fractal aggregates (flocs) that\nconstitute the gels, while rheological measurements are performed to study the\nprocess of gel rupture. As calcium salt concentration is increased, DLS\nexperiments reveal that the polydispersities of the flocs increase\nsimultaneously with the characteristic relaxation times of the gel network.\nAbove a critical salt concentration, the flocs become interlinked to form a\nreaction-limited fractal gel network.

We examine how inefficient massive star formation and\nassociated supernova feedback in high-redshift progenitors of present-day\nlow-mass subhaloes might contribute to this stochasticity. Using a Monte Carlo\napproach to follow the assembly histories of present-day low-mass haloes with\n$10^7 \\lesssim M \\leq 10^{10}$ ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$, we identify when cooling and\nstar formation is likely to proceed, and observe that haloes with present-day\nmasses $\\lesssim 10^9 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ never grow sufficiently massive to\nsupport atomic hydrogen line cooling. Noting that the star formation timescale\ndecreases sharply with stellar mass as $t_{\\rm PMS} \\propto m_{\\ast}^{-2.5}$,\nwe argue that, should the conditions for high mass star formation arise in\nlow-mass haloes, the ensuing supernovae are likely to disrupt ongoing\nlower-mass star formation and unbind gas within the halo. This potentially\nstar-forming gas is unlikely to be replenished in lower mass haloes because of,\ne.g. cosmological reionization, and so we expect galaxy formation to be stymied\nin a manner that depends on host halo assembly history and the efficiency and\ntiming of star formation in proto-galaxies, which we illustrate using a Monte\nCarlo model.

For communities of up to medium\ndiversity, e.g. excluding environments such as soil, this is often achieved by\na combination of sequence assembly and binning, where sequences are grouped\ninto 'bins' representing taxa of the underlying microbial community from which\nthey originate. Assignment to low-ranking taxonomic bins is an important\nchallenge for binning methods as is scalability to Gb-sized datasets generated\nwith deep sequencing techniques. One of the best available methods for the\nrecovery of species bins from an individual metagenome sample is the\nexpert-trained PhyloPythiaS package, where a human expert decides on the taxa\nto incorporate in a composition-based taxonomic metagenome classifier and\nidentifies the 'training' sequences using marker genes directly from the\nsample.

In Newtonian theory, the gravitational potential of a\nrotating star can be fully described by an infinite number of multipole moments\nof its mass distribution.

The workers are heterogeneous with unknown\nbut fixed qualities and their costs are private. The problem is to select for\neach task an optimal subset of workers so that the outcome obtained from the\nselected workers guarantees a target accuracy level. The problem is a\nchallenging one even in a non strategic setting since the accuracy of\naggregated label depends on unknown qualities. We develop a novel multi-armed\nbandit (MAB) mechanism for solving this problem. First, we propose a framework,\nAssured Accuracy Bandit (AAB), which leads to an MAB algorithm, Constrained\nConfidence Bound for a Non Strategic setting (CCB-NS). We derive an upper bound\non the number of time steps the algorithm chooses a sub-optimal set that\ndepends on the target accuracy level and true qualities. A more challenging\nsituation arises when the requester not only has to learn the qualities of the\nworkers but also elicit their true costs. We modify the CCB-NS algorithm to\nobtain an adaptive exploration separated algorithm which we call { \\em\nConstrained Confidence Bound for a Strategic setting (CCB-S)}. CCB-S algorithm\nproduces an ex-post monotone allocation rule and thus can be transformed into\nan ex-post incentive compatible and ex-post individually rational mechanism\nthat learns the qualities of the workers and guarantees a given target accuracy\nlevel in a cost optimal way. We provide a lower bound on the number of times\nany algorithm should select a sub-optimal set and we see that the lower bound\nmatches our upper bound upto a constant factor. We provide insights on the\npractical implementation of this framework through an illustrative example and\nwe show the efficacy of our algorithms through simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2014 11:59:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2014 06:37:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 15:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Usually, calibration is indirect, by comparison with fluid drag\nforces. This can lead to discrepancies by sizable factors. Progress achieved in\na program aiming at absolute calibration, conducted over the past fifteen\nyears, is briefly reviewed. Here we overcome its last major obstacle, a\ntheoretical overestimation of the peak stiffness, within the most employed\nrange for applications, and we perform experimental validation. The discrepancy\nis traced to the effect of primary aberrations of the optical system, which are\nnow included in the theory. All required experimental parameters are readily\naccessible. Astigmatism, the dominant effect, is measured by analyzing\nreflected images of the focused laser spot, adapting frequently employed video\nmicroscopy techniques. Combined with interface spherical aberration, it reveals\na previously unknown window of instability for trapping. Comparison with\nexperimental data leads to an overall agreement within error bars, with no\nfitting, for a broad range of microsphere radii, from the Rayleigh regime to\nthe ray optics one, for different polarizations and trapping heights, including\nall commonly employed parameter domains. Besides signalling full\nfirst-principles theoretical understanding of optical tweezers operation, the\nresults may lead to improved instrument design and control over experiments, as\nwell as to an extended domain of applicability, allowing reliable force\nmeasurements, in principle, from femtonewtons to nanonewtons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2014 13:22:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-30"}

We detect the sub-mm\nemission of the quasars, which dominates on small scales, as well as correlated\nemission from dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) dominant on larger scales.\nThe mean sub-mm flux densities of the DR7 quasars (median redshift <z>=1.4) is\n$11.1^{+1.6}_{-1.4}$, $7.1^{+1.6}_{-1.3}$ and $3.6^{+1.4}_{-1.0}$ mJy at 250,\n350 and 500 microns, respectively, while the mean sub-mm flux densities of the\nDR9 quasars (<z>=2.5) is $5.7^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$, $5.0^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$ and\n$1.8^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ mJy.

Digital\nwatermarking has emerged as a advanced technology to enhance the security of\ndigital images. The insertion of watermark in medical images can authenticate\nit and guarantee its integrity. The watermark must be generally hidden does not\naffect the quality of the medical image. In this paper, we propose blind\nwatermarking based on Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we compare the\nperformance of this technique with watermarking based DWT and SVD.

The relative velocity $\\textbf{v}$ of two\ninertial reference frames is defined in terms of the elements of the pertinent\nLorentz matrix, and the bound $|\\textbf{v}| <c\\;$ is obtained as a simple\ntheorem that follows from the structure of the Lorentz group.
