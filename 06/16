All\nmeasurements support the standard theory, except for a few anomalies discovered\nin the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe maps and confirmed recently by the\nPlanck satellite. The Cold Spot is one of the most significant of such\nanomalies, and the leading explanation of it posits a large void that imprints\nthis extremely cold area via the linear Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect due\nto the decay of gravitational potentials over cosmic time, or via the\nRees-Sciama (RS) effect due to late-time non-linear evolution. Despite several\nobservational campaigns targeting the Cold Spot region, to date no suitably\nlarge void was found at higher redshifts $z > 0.3$. Here we report the\ndetection of an $R =(192 \\pm 15) h^{-1}Mpc$ size supervoid of depth $\\delta =\n-0.13 \\pm 0.03$, and centred at redshift $z = 0.22$. This supervoid, possibly\nthe largest ever found, is large enough to significantly affect the CMB via the\nnon-linear RS effect, as shown in our Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi framework. This\ndiscovery presents the first plausible explanation for any of the physical CMB\nanomalies, and raises the possibility that local large-scale structure could be\nresponsible for other anomalies as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jun 2014 19:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-17"}

In\nthe resultant generalized formulation, operations are associated with regions\nthat can be connected in networks with no directionality assumed for the\nconnections, generalizing the standard circuit framework and the process matrix\nframework for operations without global causal order. The possible events in a\ngiven region are described by positive semidefinite operators on a Hilbert\nspace at the boundary, while the connections between regions are described by\nentangled states that encode a nontrivial symmetry and could be tested in\nprinciple.

Discrete\nreadout schemes mitigate the low-noise requirements of analog schemes and offer\nvery fine control over threshold levels and timing pickup strategies. A high\noptical fill factor is paramount to timing performance in such detectors, and\nconsequently space is limited for closely integrated electronics. Nonetheless,\na production, daily used PET scanner must minimize bandwidth usage, data\nvolume, data analysis time and power consumption and therefore requires a\nreal-time readout and data processing architecture as close to the detector as\npossible.

A quasi-invariant representation for a speech segment can be obtained by\nprojecting it to each template orbit, i.e., the set of transformed signals, and\ncomputing the associated one-dimensional empirical probability distributions.\nThe computations can be performed by modules of filtering and pooling, and\nextended to hierarchical architectures. In this paper, we apply a single-layer,\nmulticomponent representation for phonemes and demonstrate improved accuracy\nand decreased sample complexity for vowel classification compared to standard\nspectral, cepstral and perceptual features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 02:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-17"}

Existing\nworks on MapReduce load balance focus on coarse-grained scheduling. This study\nconcerns fine-grained scheduling on MapReduce operations, with each operation\nrepresenting one invocation of the Map or Reduce function. By default,\nMapReduce adopts the hash-based method to schedule Reduce operations, which\noften leads to poor load balance. In addition, the copy phase of Reduce tasks\noverlaps with Map tasks, which significantly hinders the progress of Map tasks\ndue to I/O contention. Moreover, the three phases of Reduce tasks run in\nsequence, while consuming different resources, thereby under-utilizing\nresources. To overcome these problems, we introduce a set of mechanisms named\nOS4M (Operation Scheduling for MapReduce) to improve MapReduce's performance.\nOS4M achieves load balance by collecting statistics of all Map operations, and\ncalculates a globally optimal schedule to distribute Reduce operations. With\nOS4M, the copy phase of Reduce tasks no longer overlaps with Map tasks, and the\nthree phases of Reduce tasks are pipelined based on their operation loads. OS4M\nhas been transparently incorporated into MapReduce. Evaluations on standard\nbenchmarks show that OS4M's job duration can be shortened by up to 42%,\ncompared with a baseline of Hadoop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 04:16:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-17"}

Surveys of the Galactic plane are often\nlimited in the Galactic latitude of |b| ~ 5 degree. SNRs at high latitudes,\nsuch as the Cygnus Loop or CTA~1, cannot be detected by surveys in such limited\nlatitudes. Using the available Urumqi 6 cm Galactic plane survey data, together\nwith the maps from the extended ongoing 6 cm medium latitude survey, we wish to\ndiscover new SNRs in a large sky area. We searched for shell-like structures\nand calculated radio spectra using the Urumqi 6 cm, Effelsberg 11 cm, and 21 cm\nsurvey data. Radio polarized emission and evidence in other wavelengths are\nalso examined for the characteristics of SNRs. We discover an enclosed\noval-shaped object G150.3+4.5 in the 6 cm survey map. It is about 2.5 degree\nwide and 3 degree high. Parts of the shell structures can be identified well in\nthe 11 cm, 21 cm, and 73.5 cm observations. The Effelsberg 21 cm total\nintensity image resembles most of the structures of G150.3+4.5 seen at 6 cm,\nbut the loop is not closed in the northwest. High resolution images at 21 cm\nand 73.5 cm from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey confirm the extended\nemission from the eastern and western shells of G150.3+4.5. We calculated the\nradio continuum spectral indices of the eastern and western shells, which are\n$\\beta \\sim -2.4$ and $\\beta \\sim -2.7$ between 6 cm and 21 cm, respectively.\nThe shell-like structures and their non-thermal nature strongly suggest that\nG150.3+4.5 is a shell-type SNR. For other objects in the field of view,\nG151.4+3.0 and G151.2+2.6, we confirm that the shell-like structure G151.4+3.0\nvery likely has a SNR origin, while the circular-shaped G151.2+2.6 is an HII\nregion with a flat radio spectrum, associated with optical filamentary\nstructure, H$\\alpha$, and infrared emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 04:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

The permutation\n$\\sigma$ is simply the sequence of cards in the order they are removed. This\npermutation is itself uniformly random, as long as each random card $C_t$ is\ndrawn uniformly from the remaining set at time $t$. We consider, here, a\nvariant of this simple procedure in which one is given a choice between $k$\nrandom cards from the remaining set at each step, and selects the lowest\nnumbered of these for removal. This induces a bias towards selecting lower\nnumbered of the remaining cards at each step, and therefore leads to a final\npermutation which is more \"ordered\" than in the uniform case (i.e. closer to\nthe identity permutation id $=(1,2,3,...,n)$).\n  We quantify this effect in terms of two natural measures of order: The number\nof inversions $I$ and the length of the longest increasing subsequence $L$. For\ninversions, we establish a weak law of large numbers and central limit theorem,\nboth for fixed and growing $k$. For the longest increasing subsequence, we\nestablish the rate of scaling, in general, and existence of a weak law in the\ncase of growing $k$.

If we follow the\nhypothesis that the LB stars are intrinsically metal-weak, then there should be\na connection with the intermediate Population II and F-weak objects. Such a\npossible affinity has not been previously investigated. We present detailed\nelemental abundances, including those of the light elements carbon and oxygen,\nfor 38 bright intermediate Population II and F-weak objects. In addition, we\ninvestigate the kinematic characteristics of the groups. From photometric,\nspectroscopic, and kinematic data, there is no distinction between the\nintermediate Population II and F-weak type stars. We therefore conclude that\nthe two groups are identical. However, it is possible to distinguish the LB\nstars from the intermediate Population II stars on the basis of elemental\nabundances, though not in terms of their kinematics. The LB stars seem to be\ndistinct from the intermediate Population II group. Further asteroseismologic\ninvestigations and analyses of spectroscopic binary systems are needed to\nstrengthen this conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 08:45:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 11:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}
