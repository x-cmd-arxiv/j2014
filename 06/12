This out-of-equilibrium process, induced by\nmagneto-thermal heating, is quite usual in low temperature magnetization\nstudies. A key point is to determine the physical origin of the avalanche\nprocess. In particular, in spin-ice compounds, the origin of the avalanches\nmight be related to the monopole physics inherent to the system. We have\nperformed a detailed study of the avalanche phenomena in three single crystals,\nwith the field oriented along the [111] direction, perpendicular to [111] and\nalong the [100] directions. We have measured the changing magnetization during\nthe avalanches and conclude that avalanches in spin ice are quite slow compared\nto the avalanches reported in other systems such as molecular magnets. Our\nmeasurements show that the avalanches trigger after a delay of about 500 ms and\nthat the reversal of the magnetization then occurs in a few hundreds of\nmilliseconds. These features suggest an unusual propagation of the reversal,\nwhich might be due to the monopole motion. The avalanche fields seem to be\nreproducible in a given direction for different samples, but they strongly\ndepend on the initial state of magnetization and on how the initial state was\nachieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 16:26:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The presence of\nsuch massive BHs at such early times, when the Universe was less than a billion\nyears old, implies that they grew via either super-Eddington accretion, or\nnearly uninterrupted gas accretion near the Eddington limit; the latter, at\nfirst glance, is at odds with empirical trends at lower redshifts, where quasar\nepisodes associated with rapid BH growth are rare and brief. In this work, I\nexamine whether and to what extent the growth of the $z> 6$ quasar SMBHs can be\nexplained within the standard quasar paradigm, in which major mergers of host\ngalaxies trigger episodes of rapid gas accretion below or near the Eddington\nlimit. Using a suite of Monte Carlo merger tree simulations of the assembly\nhistories of the likely hosts of the $z> 6$ quasars, I investigate (i) their\ngrowth and major merger rates out to $z\\sim 40$, and (ii) how long the feeding\nepisodes induced by host mergers must last in order to explain the observed $z>\n6$ quasar population without super-Eddington accretion. The halo major merger\nrate scales roughly as $\\propto (1+z)^{5/2}$, with quasar hosts typically\nexperiencing $> 10$ major mergers between $15> z > 6$ ($\\approx 650\\,{\\rm\nMyr}$), compared to $\\sim 1$ for typical massive galaxies at $3>z > 0$\n($\\approx 11 \\,{\\rm Gyr}$). An example of a viable sub-Eddington SMBH growth\nmodel is one where a host merger triggers feeding for a duration comparable to\nthe halo dynamical time.

We use the Boltzmann theory of\nresistivity including the temperature dependent screening effect on charged\nimpurities in the system to fit the data.

At the end of their asymptotic giant branch phase,\nintermediate and low-mass stars eject their envelopes rapidly in a super-wind\nphase, usually giving rise to planetary nebulae. In spheroidal galaxies with\nhigh stellar velocity dispersions, the interaction of these ejected envelopes\nwith the ambient diffuse gas can lead to significant, isotropic and\nsteady-state heating that scales as $\\dot{M}_\\ast\\sigma_\\ast^2$. We show that\ncooling of the central regions of the hot diffuse halo gas can be delayed for a\nHubble time for halos more massive than $\\sim10^{12.5}M_{\\odot}$ at $0<z<2$,\nalthough stellar heating alone is unlikely to forestall cooling in the most\nmassive clusters at $z=0$. This mechanism provides a natural explanation for\nthe strong trend of galaxy quiescence with stellar surface density and velocity\ndispersion. In addition, since the ejected material will thermalize to\n$kT\\sim\\sigma_\\ast^2$, this mechanism provides an explanation for the observed\nsimilarity between the central temperature of the hot diffuse gas and\n$\\sigma_\\ast^2$, a result which is not trivial in light of the short inferred\ncooling times of the hot gas. The main uncertainty in this analysis is the\nultimate fate of the stellar ejecta.

Above the scale of Landau damping\nthe Fermi velocity flows to zero, while the coupling evolves according to its\nclassical dimension. Once damping becomes important, its backreaction leads to\na crossover regime where dynamic and static damping effects compete and the\nfermion self-energy does not respect scaling.

An interesting test case in this\nrespect is that of the southern solar analogue HD41248. The radial velocity\ntime series of this star has been proposed to contain either a pair of signals\nwith periods of around 18 and 25 days, that could be due to a pair of resonant\nsuper-Earths, or a single and varying 25 day signal that could arise due to a\ncomplex interplay between differential rotation and modulated activity.

We show that over\nthe last two observing seasons this star was more intrinsically active and the\nnoise reddened, highlighting why better noise models are needed to find the\nlowest amplitude signals, in particular models that consider noise\ncorrelations.

This mirror enhances the\nvoltage of the solar cell by providing photons with multiple opportunities for\nescaping out the front surface. Efficient external luminescence is a\npre-requisite for high voltage. Intermediate mirrors in a multijunction solar\ncell can enhance the voltage for each cell in the stack.

The absolute efficiency\nincrease can be up to ~6% in dual bandgap cells with optimal intermediate and\nrear mirrors. A practical implementation of an intermediate selective mirror is\nan air gap sandwiched by antireflection coatings. The air gap provides perfect\nreflection for angles outside the escape cone, and the antireflection coating\ntransmits angles inside the escape cone. As the incoming sunlight is within the\nescape cone, it is transmitted on to the next cell, while most of the\ninternally trapped luminescence is reflected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 06:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-13"}

These observations are explained by dust grains formed by\nthe collisional fragmentation of hidden planetesimals. Such dusty planetesimal\ndiscs are known as debris discs. In a dynamically cold planetesimal disc,\ncollisional coagulation of planetesimals produces planetary embryos which then\nstir the surrounding leftover planetesimals. Thus, the collisional\nfragmentation of planetesimals that results from planet formation forms a\ndebris disc. We aim to determine the properties of the underlying planetesimals\nin debris discs by numerically modelling the coagulation and fragmentation of\nplanetesimal populations. The brightness and temporal evolution of debris discs\ndepend on the radial distribution of planetesimal discs, the location of their\ninner and outer edges, their total mass, and the size of planetesimals in the\ndisc. We find that a radially narrow planetesimal disc is most likely to result\nin a debris disc that can explain the trend of observed infrared excesses of\ndebris discs around G-type stars, for which planet formation occurs only before\n100 million years. Early debris disc formation is induced by planet formation,\nwhile the later evolution is explained by the collisional decay of leftover\nplanetesimals around planets that have already formed.

The\nanticipated advantages of such a device are around 25% less drag, for a\ncapability which ranges between equivalent and greater than twofold that of a\nconventional tail. The tail of a popular, radio-controlled, model aircraft is\nreplaced with a rotatable stabiliser and its rotation is effected by way of a\ncontinuously-rotating servo, modified with a potentiometer. Two hollow,\ncarbon-fibre shafts (one sleeved within the other so as to allow free rotation)\nserve as the mechanical link between the servo and the tail. Inserting wiring\nalong the full length of the innermost shaft and incorporating three slip rings\ninto its collar, at the forward, servo end, facilitated an electrical supply to\nthe tail. A mapping betweeen the position of the controls and states of the\nstabiliser is formulated. Small and continuous adjustments cause the stabiliser\nto rotate in the opposite direction to the controls (when viewed from aft) and\nthe deflection of the hinged control surface is proportional to the radial\ndisplacement of the controls from their centred position. For what would amount\nto large and contradictory rotations of the device in terms of this protocol\n(rotations greater than 90$^\\circ$), the desired configuration can be more\nefficiently achieved by regarding the device's original orientation to differ\nby 180$^\\circ$ from what it actually is and by reversing the sign of the\ndeflection.

An important goal for such methods is the accurate calculation\nof the rate constant over a wide range of electronic coupling strengths and it\nis often the nonadiabatic, weak-coupling limit, which being far from the\nBorn-Oppenheimer regime, provides the greatest challenge to current methods. We\nshow that in this limit there is an inherent sign problem impeding further\ndevelopment which originates from the use of the usual quantum flux correlation\nfunctions, which can be very oscillatory at short times. From linear response\ntheory, we derive a modified flux correlation function for the calculation of\nnonadiabatic reaction rates, which still rigorously gives the correct result in\nthe long-time limit regardless of electronic coupling strength, but unlike the\nusual formalism is not oscillatory in the weak-coupling regime. In particular,\na trajectory simulation of the modified correlation function is naturally\ninitialized in a region localized about the crossing of the potential energy\nsurfaces. In the weak-coupling limit, a simple link can be found between the\ndynamics initialized from this transition-state region and an generalized\nquantum golden-rule transition-state theory, which is equivalent to Marcus\ntheory in the classical harmonic limit. This new correlation function formalism\nthus provides a platform on which a wide variety of dynamical simulation\nmethods can be built aiding the development of accurate nonadiabatic rate\ntheories applicable to complex systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 08:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-04"}

Reconnection resulted in the formation of new magnetic\nconnections between the erupting magnetic structure from AR 11226 and the\nneighboring active region AR 11227 about 200 Mm from the eruption site.

In this paper, hence, we propose an online algorithm that is scalable\nto large-scale setting. Particularly, we consider the matrix decomposition\nproblem as an example, although a simple variant of the algorithm and analysis\ncan be adapted to other important problems such as matrix completion. The\ncrucial technique in our implementation is to reformulating the max-norm to an\nequivalent matrix factorization form, where the factors consist of a (possibly\novercomplete) basis component and a coefficients one. In this way, we may\nmaintain the basis component in the memory and optimize over it and the\ncoefficients for each sample alternatively. Since the memory footprint of the\nbasis component is independent of the sample size, our algorithm is appealing\nwhen manipulating a large collection of samples.

We employ a model selection scheme called TIGER (Test Infrastructure\nfor GEneral Relativity), which was originally developed to test general\nrelativity with weak binary coalescence signals that will be seen in\nsecond-generation detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. TIGER is\nwell-suited for the regime of low signal-to-noise ratio, and information from a\npopulation of sources can be combined so as to arrive at a stronger test.

Several\nreservoir computer hardware implementations have been realized recently with\nperformance comparable to digital implementations, which demonstrated the\npotential of reservoir computing for ultrahigh bandwidth signal processing\ntasks. In all these implementations however the signal pre-processing necessary\nto efficiently address the reservoir was performed digitally.

We study\nboth numerically and experimentally to what extent the pre-processing can be\nreplaced by a modulation of the input signal by either a single sine-wave or by\na sum of two sine functions, since harmonic oscillations are particularly easy\nto generate in hardware. We find that the modulation by a single sine gives\nperformance worse than state of the art.

At the same\ntime, the current best-fit value of $r$ suggests large field inflation delta\nphi>M_p, which requires a UV complete description of inflation. A very\npromising working example that predicts large tensor modes and can be UV\ncompleted is axion monodromy inflation. This realization of inflation naturally\nproduces oscillating features, as consequence of a broken shift symmetry. We\nanalyse a combination of Planck, ACT, SPT, WMAP low l polarization and BICEP2\ndata, and show a long wavelength feature from a periodic potential can\nalleviate the tension at low multipoles with an improvement delta chi^2 ~2.5-4\nper degree of freedom, depending on the level of foreground subtraction. As\nwith an introduction of running, one expects that any scale dependence should\nlead to a worsened fit at high multipoles. We show that the logarithmic nature\nof the axion feature in combination with a tilt n_s~1 allows the fit to be\nidentical to a no feature model at the 2 percent level on scales 100 =< l\n=<3500, and quite remarkable actually slightly improves the fit at scales l\n>2000. We also consider possible unremoved dust foregrounds and show that\nincluding these hardly changes the best-fit parameters. Our analysis suggests\nan axion decay constant of f/M_p ~O(.01). We discuss how Planck measurements of\nthe TE and EE spectra can further constrain axion monodromy inflation with such\na large feature. A measurement of the large scale structure power spectrum is\neven more promising, as the effect is much bigger since the tensor modes do not\naffect the large scales. At the same time, a feature could also lead to a lower\nsigma8, lifting the tension between CMB and SZ constraints on sigma8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 14:01:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 15:18:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 15:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

This includes a\ndiscussion of the effect of magnetic flux expansion and volumetric power losses\non the reduction of target power loads, the effect of divertor geometry on the\ndivertor closure and distribution of neutral species and radiation in the\ndivertor, the role of the connection length in broadening the target wetted\narea. A comparison in conditions typical for MAST inter-ELM H-mode plasmas\nconfirms improved performance of the Super-X topology resulting in\nsignificantly better divertor closure with respect to neutrals (the atomic flux\nfrom the target increased by a factor of 6, but the atomic flux from the\ndivertor to the upper SOL reduced by a factor of 2), increased radiation volume\nand increased total power loss (a factor of 2) and a reduction of target power\nloads through both magnetic flux expansion and larger volumetric power loss in\nthe divertor (a factor of 5-10 in attached plasmas). The reduction of the\ntarget power load by SXD further increases with collisionality (high density or\ndetached regimes) thanks to larger importance of volumetric power losses. It is\nfound that a cold divertor plasma leads to stronger parallel temperature\ngradients in the SOL which drive more parallel heat flux, meaning that the\neffectiveness of perpendicular transport in spreading the power at the target\ncan be reduced, and this needs to be taken into account in any optimisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 14:12:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 08:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-18"}

In\nthis paper we searched for star forming regions around the galaxy NGC2865, a\nshell galaxy which is circled by a ring of HI, with a total mass of 1.2 x\n10$^9$ M$_\\odot$. Using the Multi-Slit Imaging Spectroscopy Technique with the\nGemini telescope, we detected all H$\\alpha$ emitting sources in the\nsurroundings of the galaxy NGC2865, down to a flux limit of 10$^{-18}$ erg\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ \\AA$^{-1}$. Together with Near and Far-Ultraviolet flux\ninformation we characterize the star formation rates, masses, ages, and\nmetallicities for these HII regions. In total, we found 26 emission-line\nsources in a 60 $\\times$ 60 Kpc field centered over the southeastern tail of\nthe HI gas present around the galaxy NGC2865. Out of the 26 H$\\alpha$ emitters,\n19 are in the satellite galaxy FGCE 0745 and seven are intergalactic HII\nregions scattered over the south tail of the HI gas around NGC2865. We found\nthat the intergalactic HII regions are young ($<$200 Myr) with stellar masses\nin the range 4 X 10$^3$M$_\\odot$ to 17x10$^6$ M$_\\odot$. These are found in a\nregion of low HI gas density, where the probability of forming stars is\nexpected to be low. For one of the intergalactic HII regions we estimated a\nsolar oxygen abundance of 12 + log(O/H) $\\sim$ 8.7. We also were able to\nestimate the metallicity for the satellite galaxy FGCE0745 to be 12 + log(O/H)\n~ 8.0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 21:51:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

EPI is derived as follows. The\nobservations follow an information flow J --> I, with J the information\nintrinsic to the source and I the Fisher information level in its data, obeying\n(i) I=4 Integral dx q' -squared. Here q'= dq/dx and p(x) = q(x)-squared is the\nprobability. It was previously shown, using L. Hardy's 5 axioms defining\nphysics, that I = max. Therefore, its variation (ii) delta I = 0. Note that I\nis generic, obeying (i) for all source effects, whereas J is specific to the\nparticular effect. Hence, rather than having form (i), J obeys (iii) J =\nIntegral dx j[q(x),s(x)] with j some function of its arguments and s(x) a known\nsource, such as of mass, biological fitness, etc. Information I decreases under\nany irreversible operation such as measurement, so that I l.e. J or,\nequivalently, I = kJ where 0 l.e. k l.e. 1. Then the variation delta I = k\ndelta J so that property (ii) gives (iv) delta J = 0 as well. Then combining\n(ii) and (iv), delta(I - J) = 0. Or, I - J = L = extremum. What kind of\nextremum? Eqs. (i) and (iii) give (v) L=4q'^2 - j[q(x),s(x)]. Differentiating\n(v), (d^2 L )/(dq'^2) = +8. Then by the Legendre condition the extremum is a\nminimum. The unknown source effect obeys (vi) I - J= minimum, EPI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 20:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-16"}

Thus, noise-induced\nslow burst synchronization and fasg spike synchronization are found to appear\nin a synchronized region of the $J-D$ plane. As the rewiring probability $p$ is\ndecreased from 1 (random network) to 0 (regular lattice), the region of spike\nsynchronization shrinks rapidly in the $J-D$ plane, while the region of the\nburst synchronization decreases slowly. Population synchronization may be well\nvisualized in the raster plot of neural spikes which can be obtained in\nexperiments. Instantaneous population firing rate, $R(t)$, which is directly\nobtained from the raster plot of spikes, is a realistic population quantity\nexhibiting collective behaviors with both the slow bursting and the fast\nspiking timescales. Through frequency filtering, we separate $R(t)$ into\n$R_b(t)$ (describing the slow bursting behavior) and $R_s(t)$ (describing the\nfast intraburst spiking behavior). Then, we develop thermodynamic order\nparameters and statistical-mechanical measures, based on $R_b (t)$ and $R_s\n(t)$, for characterization of the burst and spike synchronizations of the\nbursting neurons and show their usefulness in explicit examples. With increase\nin $p$, both the degrees of the burst and spike synchronizations are found to\nincrease because more long-range connections appear. However, they become\nsaturated for some maximal values of $p$ because long-range short-cuts which\nappear up to the maximal values of $p$ play sufficient role to get maximal\ndegrees of the burst and spike synchronizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 00:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 05:53:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-11"}
