We explore the issue of allocating flow\non multiple paths, exhibiting both intra- and inter-path interference, in order\nto maximize average aggregate flow throughput (AAT) and also provide bounded\npacket delay. A distributed flow allocation scheme is proposed where allocation\nof flow on paths is formulated as an optimization problem. Through an\nillustrative topology it is shown that the corresponding problem is non-convex.\nFurthermore, a simple, but accurate model is employed for the average aggregate\nthroughput achieved by all flows, that captures both intra- and inter-path\ninterference through the SINR model. The proposed scheme is evaluated through\nNs2 simulations of several random wireless scenarios. Simulation results reveal\nthat, the model employed, accurately captures the AAT observed in the simulated\nscenarios, even when the assumption of saturated queues is removed. Simulation\nresults also show that the proposed scheme achieves significantly higher AAT,\nfor the vast majority of the wireless scenarios explored, than the following\nflow allocation schemes: one that assigns flows on paths on a round-robin\nfashion, one that optimally utilizes the best path only, and another one that\nassigns the maximum possible flow on each path. Finally, a variant of the\nproposed scheme is explored, where interference for each link is approximated\nby considering its dominant interfering nodes only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 16:52:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2016 00:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-29"}

Acoustic metasurfaces with ultralow\nprofile yet extraordinary wave manipulating properties would be highly\ndesirable for improving the performance of many acoustic wave-based\napplications. However, designing acoustic metasurfaces with similar\nfunctionality as their electromagnetic counterparts remains challenging with\ntraditional metamaterial design approaches. Here we present a design and\nrealization of an acoustic metasurface based on tapered labyrinthine\nmetamaterials. The demonstrated metasurface can not only can steer an acoustic\nbeam as expected from the generalized Snell s law, but also exhibits various\nunique properties including surface wave conversion, extraordinary\nbeam-steering and apparent negative refraction through higher-order\ndiffraction. Such designer acoustic metasurfaces provide a new design\nmethodology for acoustic signal modulation devices and may be useful for\napplications such as beam-steering, surface wave manipulation, high efficiency\nsound absorption, acoustic imaging and ultrasound lens design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 16:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

As\nsuch, we consider the problem of discovering topical phrases of mixed lengths.\nExisting work either performs post processing to the inference results of\nunigram-based topic models, or utilizes complex n-gram-discovery topic models.\nThese methods generally produce low-quality topical phrases or suffer from poor\nscalability on even moderately-sized datasets. We propose a different approach\nthat is both computationally efficient and effective. Our solution combines a\nnovel phrase mining framework to segment a document into single and multi-word\nphrases, and a new topic model that operates on the induced document partition.\nOur approach discovers high quality topical phrases with negligible extra cost\nto the bag-of-words topic model in a variety of datasets including research\npublication titles, abstracts, reviews, and news articles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 17:10:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 00:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Previous methods often considered only small\nsubsets of image pixels; matching only pixels for which stable scales may be\nreliably estimated. More recently, others have considered dense\ncorrespondences, but with substantial costs associated with generating, storing\nand matching scale invariant descriptors. Our work here is motivated by the\nobservation that pixels in the image have contexts -- the pixels around them --\nwhich may be exploited in order to estimate local scales reliably and\nrepeatably. Specifically, we make the following contributions. (i) We show that\nscales estimated in sparse interest points may be propagated to neighboring\npixels where this information cannot be reliably determined. Doing so allows\nscale invariant descriptors to be extracted anywhere in the image, not just in\ndetected interest points. (ii) We present three different means for propagating\nthis information: using only the scales at detected interest points, using the\nunderlying image information to guide the propagation of this information\nacross each image, separately, and using both images simultaneously. Finally,\n(iii), we provide extensive results, both qualitative and quantitative,\ndemonstrating that accurate dense correspondences can be obtained even between\nvery different images, with little computational costs beyond those required by\nexisting methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 17:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

This has motivated inflationary models with such sharp\nfeatures. Recently, even the possibility of having nulls in the power spectrum\n(at certain scales) has been considered. The existence of these nulls has been\nshown in linear perturbation theory. What shall be the effect of higher order\ncorrections on such nulls? Inspired by this question, we attempt to calculate\nquantum radiative corrections to the Fourier transform of the two-point\nfunction in a toy field theory and address the issue of how these corrections\nto the power spectrum behave in models in which the tree-level power spectrum\nhas a sharp dip (but not a null). In particular, we consider the possibility of\nthe relative enhancement of radiative corrections in a model in which the\ntree-level spectrum goes through a dip in power at a certain scale. The mode\nfunctions of the field (whose power spectrum is to be evaluated) are chosen\nsuch that they undergo the kind of dynamics that leads to a sharp dip in the\ntree level power spectrum. Next we consider the situation in which this field\nhas quartic self interactions and find one loop correction in a suitably chosen\nrenormalization scheme. We thus attempt to answer the following key question in\nthe context of this toy model (which is as important in the realistic case): in\nthe chosen renormalization scheme, can quantum radiative corrections get\nenhanced relative to tree-level power spectrum at scales at which sharp dips\nappear in the tree-level spectrum?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 19:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-25"}

We find that the X-ray\nenhancement is $\\sim$6' or $\\sim$100 pc across, and is concentrated to the\nnorth and west of the densest part of the cloud. We modeled the X-ray\nenhancement with a variety of spectral models.

However, this\nmodel underpredicts the on-enhancement emission around 1 keV, which may\nindicate the additional presence of hotter plasma ($T \\gtrsim 10^7$ K), or that\nrecombination emission is important. We examined several different physical\nmodels for the origin of the X-ray enhancement. We find that turbulent mixing\nof cold cloud material with hot ambient material, compression or shock heating\nof a hot ambient medium, and charge exchange reactions between cloud atoms and\nions in a hot ambient medium all lead to emission that is too faint. In\naddition, shock heating in a cool or warm medium leads to emission that is too\nsoft (for reasonable cloud speeds). We find that magnetic reconnection could\nplausibly power the observed X-ray emission, but resistive\nmagnetohydrodynamical simulations are needed to test this hypothesis.

It can be applied even if the Bondi radius is not\nwell-resolved in X-ray observations. This method is based on two simple\nassumptions: (1) hot gas outside the Bondi radius is in nearly a hydrostatic\nequilibrium, and (2) the gas temperature near the galaxy centre is close to the\nvirial temperature. We apply this method to 28 bright elliptical galaxies in\nnearby galaxy clusters (27 of them are the brightest cluster galaxies; BCGs).\nWe find a correlation between the Bondi accretion rates and the power of jets\nassociated with the SMBHs over four orders of magnitude in \\dot M_B. For most\ngalaxies, the accretion rates are large enough to account for the jet powers.\nOur results indicate that the feedback from the active galactic nuclei (AGN)\ncorrelates with the properties of the hot gas surrounding the SMBHs. We also\nfind that more massive SMBHs in BCGs tend to have larger specific growth rates.\nThis may explain the hyper masses (~ 10^10 M_sun) of some of the SMBHs.\nComparison between the accretion rates and the X-ray luminosities of the AGN\nsuggests that the AGN in the BCGs are extremely radiatively inefficient\ncompared with X-ray binaries in the Milky Way, even when their Eddington\naccretion ratio, \\dot M_B/\\dot M_Edd, exceeds 0.01. Lastly, we find a tight\ncorrelation between the Bondi accretion rates and the X-ray luminosities of\ncool cores. Their relation is linear and the power generated by the Bondi\naccretion is large enough to compensate the radiative cooling of the cool\ncores. Although the `classical' Bondi accretion model is a greatly\noversimplified one, the correlations we find here demonstrate that the\naccretion onto the SMBHs reflects broadly the properties of the Bondi\naccretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 20:00:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 06:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

We use a tiered\napproach, which combines large-scale semi-numeric simulations of reionization\nwith moderate-scale hydrodynamic simulations of the ionized IGM. This allows us\nto simultaneously account for evolution in both: (i) the opacity from an\nincomplete (patchy) reionization, parameterized by the filling factor of\nionized regions, Q_HII; and (ii) the opacity from self-shielded systems in the\nionized IGM, parameterized by the average photo-ionization rate inside HII\nregions, \\Gamma. In contrast to recent empirical models, attenuation from\npatchy reionization has a unimodal distribution along different sightlines,\nwhile attenuation from self-shielded systems is more bimodal. We quantify the\naverage IGM transmission in our (Q_HII, \\Gamma) parameter space, which can\neasily be used to interpret new data sets.

Within the framework we show that a transit\nsurvey's window function can be approximated using the hypergeometric\nprobability distribution.

Recent data on the\nstrength of the electron-phonon coupling are used in the present analysis and\nthe contribution of the readout noise to the Noise Equivalent Power (NEP) is\nexplicitly computed. The readout scheme utilizes Johnson Noise Thermometry\n(JNT) allowing for Frequency-Domain Multiplexing (FDM) using narrowband filter\ncoupling of the HEBs.

A UV\nlaser instead can create straight ionization tracks in liquid argon, and allows\none to map the drift field along different paths in the TPC inner volume. Here\nwe present a UV laser feed-through design with a steerable UV mirror immersed\nin liquid argon that can point the laser beam at many locations through the\nTPC. The straight ionization paths are sensitive to drift field distortions, a\nfit of these distortion to the linear optical path allows to extract the drift\nfield, by using these laser tracks along the whole TPC volume one can obtain a\n3D drift field map. The UV laser feed-through assembly is a prototype of the\nsystem that will be used for the MicroBooNE experiment at the Fermi National\nAccelerator Laboratory (FNAL).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 21:53:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 13:45:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Oct 2014 15:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

We show that the steady-state separation mode, where the separation\nfront speed is independent of the wave amplitude, exists only in a bounded\nspeed-dependent range of the wave amplitude. As the latter exceeds the critical\nvalue the steady-state mode is replaced by a more complicated regime with\nporous-like local separations emerging at a distance ahead of the main\ntransition front. The crucial feature of this simple model is that the wave\ngroup speed is greater than the phase speed. The analytical solution allows us\nto show in detail how the steady-state mode transforms into the forerunning\none. The established forerunning mode studied numerically manifests itself as a\nperiodic process.

In\nparticular, the constant bombardment of the walls of the reactor with high\ndoses of He ions is known to lead to deleterous changes in their\nmicrostructures. These changes follow from the aggregation of He into bubbles\nthat can grow and blister, potentially leading to the contamination of the\nplasma, or to the degradation of their mechanical properties. We\ncomputationally study the behavior of small clusters of He atoms in W in\nconditions relevant to fusion energy production. Using a wide range of\ntechniques, we investigate the thermodynamics of the clusters and their\nkinetics in terms of diffusivity, growth, and breakup, as well as mutation into\nnano-bubbles.

The formalization of properties that characterize good\nperformance has led to the development and popularization of thick tailed\nmixtures of g priors such as the Zellner--Siow and hyper-g priors. The\nproperties of a particular prior are typically illuminated under limits on the\nlikelihood or the prior. In this paper we introduce a new, conditional\ninformation asymptotic that is motivated by the common data analysis setting\nwhere at least one regression coefficient is much larger than others. We\nanalyze existing mixtures of g priors under this limit and reveal two new\nbehaviors, Essentially Least Squares (ELS) estimation and the Conditional\nLindley's Paradox (CLP), and argue that these behaviors are, in general,\nundesirable. As the driver behind both of these behaviors is the use of a\nsingle, latent scale parameter that is common to all coefficients, we propose a\nblock hyper-g prior, defined by first partitioning the covariates into groups\nand then placing independent hyper-g priors on the corresponding blocks of\ncoefficients. We provide conditions under which ELS and the CLP are avoided by\nthe new class of priors, and provide consistency results under traditional\nsample size asymptotics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2014 00:04:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 16:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

To achieve this goal, we study a galaxy\ncluster WHL J085910.0+294957 at z = 0.30 using deep images obtained with CQUEAN\nCCD camera mounted on the 2.1-m Otto Struve telescope.

Associated with each point on the surface is a deflection map (or\nspectrum) which describes the pattern of deflections in various directions.\nThis article presents a novel method to efficiently acquire and reconstruct\nsparse deflection spectra induced by smooth object surfaces. To this end, we\nleverage the framework of Compressed Sensing (CS) in a particular\nimplementation of a schlieren deflectometer, i.e., an optical system providing\nlinear measurements of deflection spectra with programmable spatial light\nmodulation patterns. We design those modulation patterns on the principle of\nspread spectrum CS for reducing the number of observations. The ability of our\ndevice to simultaneously observe the deflection spectra on a dense\ndiscretization of the object surface is related to a Multiple Measurement\nVector (MMV) model. This scheme allows us to estimate both the noise power and\nthe instrumental point spread function.\n  We formulate the spectrum reconstruction task as the solving of a linear\ninverse problem regularized by an analysis sparsity prior using a translation\ninvariant wavelet frame. Our results demonstrate the capability and advantages\nof using a CS based approach for deflectometric imaging both on simulated data\nand experimental deflectometric data.\n  Finally, the paper presents an extension of our method showing how we can\nextract the main deflection direction in each point of the object surface from\na few compressive measurements, without needing any costly reconstruction\nprocedures. This compressive characterization is then confirmed with\nexperimental results on simple plano-convex and multifocal intra-ocular lenses\nstudying the evolution of the main deflection as a function of the object point\nlocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2014 00:46:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 18:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

We detected negative superhumps in VW Hyi and indicated that the low\nnumber of normal outbursts in some supercycle can be interpreted as a result of\nthe disk tilt. This finding, combined with the Kepler observation of V1504 Cyg\nand V344 Lyr, suggests that the disk tilt is responsible for modulating the\noutburst pattern in SU UMa-type dwarf novae. We also studied the deeply\neclipsing WZ Sge-type dwarf nova MASTER OT J005740.99+443101.5 and found\nevidence of a sharp eclipse during the phase of early superhumps.

The curved cavity system\nresolves the quandary of the conventional mechanical system where the\nBose-Einstein distribution requires higher frequencies for lower quantum\noccupation factors contrary to the constraint of an inverse frequency\ndependence of the quantum fluctuations of displacement. We demonstrate how the\nnon-trivial cavity geometry can lead to better phonon trapping, enhancing the\nvariance of zero-point-fluctuations of displacement. This variance becomes\nindependent of overtone number (or BAW resonance frequency) overcoming the\nconstraint and allowing better observation of quantum effects in a mechanical\nsystem. The piezoelectric electro-mechanical coupling approach is qualitatively\ncompared to the parametric optomechanical technique for the curved BAW\ncavities. In both cases the detectible quantity grows proportional to the\nsquare root of the overtone number, and thus the resonance frequency. Also, the\nphonon trapping improves with higher overtone numbers, which allows the\nelectrode size to be reduced such that in the optimal case the parasitic\ncapacitive impedance becomes independent of the overtone number, allowing\neffective coupling to very high frequency overtones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2014 01:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-17"}

Using analytic\nself-similar solutions and full numerical integrations we find (for isothermal\natmospheres with adiabatic index ($\\gamma=5/3$) that the local atmospheric mass\nloss fraction for ground velocities $v_g < 0.25 v_{esc}$ is given by\n$\\chi_{loss}=(1.71 v_g/v_{esc})^{4.9}$, where $v_{esc}$ is the escape velocity\nfrom the target. Yet, the global atmospheric mass loss is a weaker function of\nthe impactor velocity $v_{Imp}$ and mass $m_{Imp}$ and given by $X_{loss} ~\n0.4x+1.4x^2-0.8x^3$ (isothermal atmosphere) and $X_{loss} ~ 0.4x+1.8x^2-1.2x^3$\n(adiabatic atmosphere), where $x=(v_{Imp}m/v_{esc}M)$. Atmospheric mass loss\ndue to planetesimal impacts proceeds in two different regimes: 1) Large enough\nimpactors $m > \\sqrt{2} \\rho_0 (\\pi h R)^{3/2}$ (25~km for the current Earth),\nare able to eject all the atmosphere above the tangent plane of the impact\nsite, which is $h/2R$ of the whole atmosphere, where $h$, $R$ and $\\rho_0$ are\nthe atmospheric scale height, radius of the target, and its atmospheric density\nat the ground. 2) Smaller impactors, but above $m>4 \\pi \\rho_0 h^3$ (1~km for\nthe current Earth) are only able to eject a fraction of the atmospheric mass\nabove the tangent plane. We find that the most efficient impactors (per unit\nimpactor mass) for atmospheric loss are planetesimals just above that lower\nlimit and that the current atmosphere of the Earth could have resulted from an\nequilibrium between atmospheric erosion and volatile delivery to the atmosphere\nfrom planetesimals. We conclude that planetesimal impacts are likely to have\nplayed a major role in atmospheric mass loss over the formation history of the\nterrestrial planets.

Proper motions were measured with an accuracy\nof ~0.1 mas/yr (~4 km/s) at F606W~25.5 mag, and better than ~0.5 mas/yr (20\nkm/s) at F606W~28 mag, in both axes. Proper-motion measurements allowed us to\nseparate disk and bulge stars and obtain a clean bulge color-magnitude diagram.\nWe then identified for the first time a white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence in\nthe Galactic bulge, together with a dozen candidate extreme horizontal branch\nstars. The comparison between theory and observations shows that a substantial\nfraction of the WDs (30%) are systematically redder than the cooling tracks for\nCO-core H-rich and He-rich envelope WDs. This evidence would suggest the\npresence of a significant number of low-mass WDs and WD - main sequence\nbinaries in the bulge. This hypothesis is further supported by the finding of\ntwo dwarf novae in outburst, two short-period (P < 1 d) ellipsoidal variables,\nand a few candidate cataclysmic variables in the same field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2014 03:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We find that an indirect bandgap emerges in bilayers\nwith any stacking configuration, but the bandgap size varies appreciably with\nthe twist angle: it shows the largest redshift for AA- and AB-stacked bilayers,\nand a significantly smaller but constant redshift for all other twist angles.\nThe vibration frequency of the out-of-plane phonon in MoS2 shows similar twist\nangle dependence.

However, the average power of\nextragalactic sources, which is of ${\\cal E}\\simeq 10^{43}erg \\,s^{-1}$, at\nleast two orders exceeds the power emitted by the Galaxy in cosmic rays,\nassuming that the density of galaxies is estimated as $N_g\\simeq 1 Mpc^{-3}$.\nConsidering that such power can be provided by relativistic jets from active\ngalactic nuclei with the power ${\\cal E}\\simeq 10^{45} - 10^{46} erg \\,\ns^{-1}$, we estimate the density of extragalactic sources of cosmic rays as\n$N_g\\simeq 10^{-2}-10^{-3}\\, Mpc^{-3}$. Assuming the same nature of Galactic\nand extragalactic rays, we conclude that the Galactic rays were produced by a\nrelativistic jet emitted from the Galactic center during the period of its\nactivity in the past. The remnants of a bipolar jet are now observed in the\nform of bubbles of relativistic gas above and below the Galactic plane. The\nbreak, observed in the spectrum of Galactic rays ('knee'), is explained by fast\nescape of energetic particle, $E>3\\cdot 10^{15}eV$, from the Galaxy because of\nthe dependence of the coefficient of diffusion of cosmic rays on energy,\n$D\\propto E^{0.7}$. The obtained index of the density distribution of particles\nover energy, $N(E)\\propto E^{-2.7-0.7/2}=E^{-3.05}$, for $E>3\\cdot 10^{15}eV$\nagrees well with the observed one, $N(E)\\propto E^{-3.1}$.

Coordinated sampling, where samples of different\ndata sets \"share\" the randomization, is a powerful method which facilitates\nmore accurate estimation of many aggregates and similarity measures. We\nrecently formulated a model of {\\it Monotone Estimation Problems} (MEP), which\ncan be applied to coordinated sampling, projected on a single item. MEP\nestimators can then be used to estimate sum aggregates, such as distances, over\ncoordinated samples. For MEP, we are interested in estimators that are unbiased\nand nonnegative. We proposed {\\it variance competitiveness} as a quality\nmeasure of estimators: For each data vector, we consider the minimum variance\nattainable on it by an unbiased and nonnegative estimator. We then define the\ncompetitiveness of an estimator as the maximum ratio, over data, of the\nexpectation of the square to the minimum possible.

Yet little is known about the information criterion for\ncovariance matrix estimation. How to properly define such a criterion and what\nare the statistical properties? We attempt to answer these questions in the\npresent paper by focusing on the estimation of bandable covariance matrices\nwhen $p>n$ but $\\log(p)=o(n)$. Motivated by the deep connection between Stein's\nunbiased risk estimation (SURE) and AIC in regression models, we propose a\nfamily of generalized SURE ($\\text{SURE}_c$) indexed by $c$ for covariance\nmatrix estimation, where $c$ is some constant. When $c$ is 2, $\\text{SURE}_2$\nprovides an unbiased estimator of the Frobenious risk of the covariance matrix\nestimator. Furthermore, we show that by minimizing $\\text{SURE}_2$ over all\npossible banding covariance matrix estimators we attain the minimax optimal\nrate of convergence and the resulting estimator behaves like the covariance\nmatrix estimator obtained by the so-called oracle tuning. On the other hand, we\nalso show that $\\text{SURE}_2$ is selection inconsistent when the true\ncovariance matrix is exactly banded. To fix the selection inconsistency, we\nconsider using SURE with $c=\\log(n)$ and prove that by minimizing\n$\\text{SURE}_{\\log(n)}$ we select the true bandwith with probability tending to\none. Therefore, our analysis indicates that $\\text{SURE}_2$ and\n$\\text{SURE}_{\\log(n)}$ can be regarded as the AIC and BIC for large covariance\nmatrix estimation, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2014 10:04:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 23:14:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 12:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-07"}

Moreover, sparse signal\nmodels have successfully been used in many vision applications. Within this\narea of research, the so called co-sparse analysis model has attracted\nconsiderably less attention than its well-known counterpart, the sparse\nsynthesis model, although it has been proven to be very useful in various image\nprocessing applications. In this paper, we propose a co-sparse analysis model\nthat is able to capture the interdependency of two image modalities. It is\nbased on the assumption that a pair of analysis operators exists, so that the\nco-supports of the corresponding bimodal image structures are correlated. We\npropose an algorithm that is able to learn such a coupled pair of operators\nfrom registered and noise-free training data. Furthermore, we explain how this\nmodel can be applied to solve linear inverse problems in image processing and\nhow it can be used for image registration tasks. This paper extends the work of\nsome of the authors by two major contributions. Firstly, a modification of the\nlearning process is proposed that a priori guarantees unit norm and zero-mean\nof the rows of the operator. This accounts for the intuition that contrast in\nimage modalities carries the most information. Secondly, the model is used in a\nnovel bimodal image registration algorithm which estimates the transformation\nparameters of unregistered images of different modalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2014 12:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-26"}

Alternative approaches include heuristic\nmethods that employ iterative optimization procedures for detecting multiple\ncircles.

This\npaper presents an algorithm for automatic detection of multiple circular shapes\nthat considers the overall process as a multi-modal optimization problem. The\napproach is based on the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, a swarm\noptimization algorithm inspired by the intelligent foraging behavior of honey\nbees. Unlike the original ABC algorithm, the proposed approach presents the\naddition of a memory for discarded solutions. Such memory allows holding\nimportant information regarding other local optima which might have emerged\nduring the optimization process. The detector uses a combination of three\nnon-collinear edge points as parameters to determine circle candidates. A\nmatching function (nectar- amount) determines if such circle candidates\n(bee-food-sources) are actually present in the image. Guided by the values of\nsuch matching functions, the set of encoded candidate circles are evolved\nthrough the ABC algorithm so that the best candidate (global optimum) can be\nfitted into an actual circle within the edge only image.

In the last few years, an extensive numerical\nexperimentation showed that SGP equipped with a suitable choice of the scaling\nmatrix is a very effective tool for solving large scale variational problems\narising in image and signal processing. In spite of the very reliable numerical\nresults observed, only a weak, though very general, convergence theorem is\nprovided, establishing that any limit point of the sequence generated by SGP is\nstationary. Here, under the only assumption that the objective function is\nconvex and that a solution exists, we prove that the sequence generated by SGP\nconverges to a minimum point, if the scaling matrices sequence satisfies a\nsimple and implementable condition.

Indeed, it has recently been observed that they are real and\nactive users that can help malicious users such as spammers gaining influence.\nStudying their behavior and understanding their position in Twitter is thus of\nimportant interest. A recent work provided an efficient way to detect social\ncapitalists using two simple topological measures.

The central problem studied in this paper is to determine the set of\nparameter valuations $V_{\\prec p} (\\varphi)$ for which the probability to\nsatisfy pLTL-formula $\\varphi$ in a Markov chain meets a given threshold $\\prec\np$, where $\\prec$ is a comparison on reals and $p$ a probability. As for pLTL\ndetermining the emptiness of $V_{> 0}(\\varphi)$ is undecidable, we consider\nseveral logic fragments. We consider parametric reachability properties, a\nsub-logic of pLTL restricted to next and $\\Diamond_{\\le x}$, parametric B\\\"uchi\nproperties and finally, a maximal subclass of pLTL for which emptiness of $V_{>\n0}(\\varphi)$ is decidable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 2014 08:19:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-27"}

We demonstrate a scheme to couple two independent mechanical\noscillators, separated in frequency by 80kHz and situated far from each other\n(3.2km), via light. Using light as the coupling medium enables this scheme to\nhave low loss and be extended over long distances. This scheme is reversible\nand can be generalised for arbitrary network configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 22:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}
