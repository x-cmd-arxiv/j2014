Highly precise Doppler\nmeasurements were obtained using the Coralie high-resolution spectrograph since\n2011. Particular care was taken to sample all phase points in order to very\naccurately trace the RV curve during multiple epochs and to search for\ndifferences in linear radius variations derived from observations obtained at\ndifferent epochs. Different timescales are sampled, ranging from cycle-to-cycle\nto months and years. The unprecedented combination of excellent phase coverage\nobtained during multiple epochs and high precision enabled the discovery of\nsignificant modulation in the RV curves of the short-period s-Cepheids QZ\nNormae and V335 Puppis, as well as the long-period fundamental mode Cepheids l\nCarinae and RS Puppis. The modulations manifest as shape and amplitude\nvariations that vary smoothly on timescales of years for short-period Cepheids\nand from one pulsation cycle to the next in the long-period Cepheids. The order\nof magnitude of the effect ranges from several hundred m/s to a few km/s. The\nresulting difference among linear radius variations derived using data from\ndifferent epochs can lead to systematic errors of up to 15% for\nBaade-Wesselink-type distances, if the employed angular and linear radius\nvariations are not determined contemporaneously. The different natures of the\nCepheids exhibiting modulation in their RV curves suggests that this phenomenon\nis common. The observational baseline is not yet sufficient to conclude whether\nthese modulations are periodic. To ensure the accuracy of Baade-Wesselink\ndistances, angular and linear radius variations should always be determined\ncontemporaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 16:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-11"}

Photopion production efficiency of cosmic-rays\naccelerated in the inner jets of flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) is ~1-10%\ndue to interactions with photons of the broad-line region (BLR), whereas BL Lac\nobjects are not effective PeV neutrino sources due to the lack of external\nradiation fields.

The\nconfiguration $x_0$ can correspond to the bottom of a (meta)stable well, while\nthe target $G$ could be either a set of saddle (exit) points of the well, or a\nset of further (meta)stable configurations. Three types of results are\nreported: (1) A general theory is developed, based on the path-wise approach to\nmetastability, which has three important attributes. First, it is general in\nthat it does not assume reversibility of the process, does not focus only on\nhitting times to rare events and does not assume a particular starting measure.\nSecond, it relies only on the natural hypothesis that the mean hitting time to\n$G$ is asymptotically longer than the mean recurrence time to $x_0$ or $G$.\nThird, despite its mathematical simplicity, the approach yields precise and\nexplicit bounds on the corrections to exponentiality. (2) We compare and relate\ndifferent metastability conditions proposed in the literature so to eliminate\npotential sources of confusion. This is specially relevant for evolutions of\ninfinite-volume systems, whose treatment depends on whether and how relevant\nparameters (temperature, fields) are adjusted. (3) We introduce the notion of\nearly asymptotic exponential behavior to control time scales asymptotically\nsmaller than the mean-time scale. This control is particularly relevant for\nsystems with unbounded state space where nucleations leading to exit from\nmetastability can happen anywhere in the volume. We provide natural sufficient\nconditions on recurrence times for this early exponentiality to hold and show\nthat it leads to estimations of probability density functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 17:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-11"}

The\ngiant impact phase follows the oligarchic growth phase, which builds a bi-modal\nmass distribution within the disc of embryos and planetesimals. By varying the\nratio of the total mass in the embryo population to the total mass in the\nplanetesimal population and the mass of the individual embryos, we explore how\ndifferent disc conditions control the final planets.

Imbuing the driving\nfield with Newtonian dynamics, we find that the full closed system exhibits a\nrobust new phenomenon -- dynamic critical trapping -- in which the system is\nself-trapped near the critical point due to efficient absorption of field\nkinetic energy by heating the quantum spins.

In this\npaper, we attempt to quantify the effects of rotation on tidal angular momentum\ntransport in binary stars, with specific calculations applied to WD stellar\nmodels. We incorporate the effect of rotation using the traditional\napproximation, in which the dynamically excited gravity waves within the WDs\nare transformed into gravito-inertial Hough waves.

We\nidentify new dynamical tidal forcing terms that arise from a proper separation\nof the equilibrium and dynamical tide components; these new forcing terms are\nvery important for systems near synchronous rotation. Additionally, we discuss\nthe impact of Stokes drift currents on the wave angular momentum flux.

The antenna scaling is justified by the current trend towards the use of\nhigher carrier frequencies, which allows to pack large number of antennas in\nsmall form factors. The main goal is to study the per-BS antenna requirement\nthat ensures scalability of this network, i.e., its ability to deliver\nnon-vanishing rate to each source-destination pair. We first derive an\ninformation theoretic upper bound on the capacity of this network under a\ngeneral propagation model, which provides a lower bound on the per-BS antenna\nrequirement. Then, we characterize the scalability requirements for two\ncompeting strategies of interest: (i) long hop: each source-destination pair\nminimizes the number of hops by sacrificing multiplexing gain while achieving\nfull beamforming (power) gain over each hop, and (ii) short hop: each\nsource-destination pair communicates through a series of short hops, each\nachieving full multiplexing gain. While long hop may seem more intuitive in the\ncontext of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, we show\nthat the short hop strategy is significantly more efficient in terms of per-BS\nantenna requirement for throughput scalability.

The Fermi gamma-ray pulsar population now exceeds 140 sources\nand has defined an important part of Fermi's science legacy. Among the\npopulation characteristics well established is the common occurrence of\nexponential turnovers in their spectra in the 1--10 GeV range. These turnovers\nare too gradual to arise from magnetic pair creation in the strong magnetic\nfields of pulsar inner magnetospheres. By demanding insignificant photon\nattenuation precipitated by such single-photon pair creation, the energies of\nthese turnovers for Fermi pulsars can be used to compute lower bounds for the\ntypical altitude of GeV band emission. This paper explores such pair\ntransparency constraints below the turnover energy, and updates earlier\naltitude bound determinations of that have been deployed in various Fermi\npulsar papers. For low altitude emission locales, general relativistic\ninfluences are found to be important. Rotational aberration influences are also\nexplored, and are found to be small at low altitudes, except near the magnetic\npole. The altitude bounds are typically in the range of 2-7 stellar radii for\nthe young Fermi pulsar population, and provide key information on the emission\naltitude in radio quiet pulsars that do not possess double-peaked pulse\nprofiles. The bound for the Crab pulsar is at a much higher altitude, with the\nputative detection by MAGIC out to 350-400 GeV implying a lower bound of 310km\nto the emission region, i.e., approximately 20% of the light cylinder radius.\nThese results are also extended to the super-critical field domain, where it is\nfound that emission in magnetars originating below around 10 stellar radii will\nnot appear in the Fermi-LAT band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 02:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The HT-coset codes, including\nReed-Muller~(RM) codes and polar codes as typical examples, can share a pair of\nencoder and decoder with implementation complexity of order $O(N \\log N)$.\nHowever, to guarantee that all codes with designated rates perform well,\nHT-coset coding usually requires a sufficiently large code length, which in\nturn causes difficulties in the determination of which bits are better for\nbeing frozen.

The Planck data\nshows an unmistakably red, quasi scale-invariant, purely adiabatic primordial\npower spectrum and no primary non-Gaussianities. While these observations are\nconsistent with inflationary predictions, bouncing cosmologies aspire to\nprovide an alternative framework to explain them. Such models face many\nproblems, both of the purely theoretical kind, such as the necessity of\nviolating the NEC and instabilities, and at the cosmological application level,\nas exemplified by the possible presence of shear. We provide a pedagogical\nintroduction to these problems and also assess the fitness of different\nproposals with respect to the data. For example, many models predict a slightly\nblue spectrum and must be fine-tuned to generate a red spectral index; as a\nside effect, large non-Gaussianities often result.\n  We highlight several promising attempts to violate the NEC without\nintroducing dangerous instabilities at the classical and/or quantum level.

We consider state-triggered jumps\nin the state evolution, potentially accompanied by mode switching in the\ncontrol vector field as well. For a given trajectory with state jumps, we show\nhow to construct an approximation of a nearby perturbed trajectory\ncorresponding to a small variation of the initial condition and input. A major\ncomplication in the construction of such an approximation is that, in general,\nthe jump times corresponding to a nearby perturbed trajectory are not equal to\nthose of the nominal one. The main contribution of this work is the development\nof a notion of error to clarify in which sense the approximate trajectory is,\nat each instant of time, a firstorder approximation of the perturbed\ntrajectory. This notion of error naturally finds application in the (local)\ntracking problem of a time-varying reference trajectory of a hybrid system. To\nillustrate the possible use of this new error definition in the context of\ntrajectory tracking, we outline how the standard linear trajectory tracking\ncontrol for nonlinear systems -based on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) theory\nto compute the optimal feedback gain- could be generalized for hybrid systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 07:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-12"}

The earliest spectrum (taken at t=-8 days) shows\na possible signature of helium (He~I 5876 at a velocity of ~19,000 km s{-1}).\nMoreover, the larger intensity ratio of the [O I] 6300 and 6364 lines inferred\nfrom the early nebular spectra implies a lower opacity of the ejecta shortly\nafter the explosion. These results indicate that SN 2007gr perhaps underwent a\nless energetic explosion of a smaller-mass Wolf-Rayet star (~ 8--9 Msun) in a\nbinary system, as favored by an analysis of the progenitor environment through\npre-explosion and post-explosion Hubble Space Telescope images. In the nebular\nspectra, asymmetric double-peaked profiles can be seen in the [O~I] 6300 and\nMg~I] 4571 lines. We suggest that the two peaks are contributed by the\nblueshifted and rest-frame components. The similarity in velocity structure and\nthe different evolution of the strength of the two components favor an\naspherical explosion with the ejecta distributed in a torus or disk-like\ngeometry, but inside the ejecta the O and Mg have different distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 08:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

Studying the\nstructure and kinematics of NSCs reveals the history of mass accretion of\ngalaxy nuclei. Because the Milky Way (MW) NSC is at a distance of only 8kpc, we\ncan spatially resolve the MWNSC on sub-pc scales. This makes the MWNSC a\nreference object for understanding the formation of all NSCs. We have used the\nNIR long-slit spectrograph ISAAC (VLT) in a drift-scan to construct an\nintegral-field spectroscopic map of the central 9.5 x 8pc of our Galaxy. We use\nthis data set to extract stellar kinematics both of individual stars and from\nthe unresolved integrated light spectrum. We present a velocity and dispersion\nmap from the integrated light and model these kinematics using kinemetry and\naxisymmetric Jeans models. We also measure CO bandhead strengths of 1,375\nspectra from individual stars. We find kinematic complexity in the NSCs radial\nvelocity map including a misalignment of the kinematic position angle by 9\ndegree counterclockwise relative to the Galactic plane, and indications for a\nrotating substructure perpendicular to the Galactic plane at a radius of 20\" or\n0.8pc. We determine the mass of the NSC within r = 4.2pc to 1.4 x 10^7 Msun. We\nalso show that our kinematic data results in a significant underestimation of\nthe supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass. The kinematic substructure and\nposition angle misalignment may hint at distinct accretion events. This\nindicates that the MWNSC grew at least partly by the mergers of massive star\nclusters. Compared to other NSCs, the MWNSC is on the compact side of the r_eff\n- M_NSC relation. The underestimation of the SMBH mass might be caused by the\nkinematic misalignment and a stellar population gradient. But it is also\npossible that there is a bias in SMBH mass measurements obtained with\nintegrated light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 10:06:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 10:45:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

The goal of this\nstudy is to understand the role that handbooks play in knowledge creation and\ndiffusion and their relationship with the genre of journal articles,\nparticularly in highly interdisciplinary and emergent social science and\nhumanities disciplines. To shed light on these questions we focused on\nhandbooks and journal articles published over the last four decades belonging\nto the research area of Science and Technology Studies (STS), broadly defined.\nTo get a detailed picture we used the full-text of five handbooks (500,000\nwords) and a well-defined set of 11,700 STS articles. We confirmed the\nmethodological split of STS into qualitative and quantitative (scientometric)\napproaches. Even when the two traditions explore similar topics (e.g., science\nand gender) they approach them from different starting points. The change in\ncognitive foci in both handbooks and articles partially reflects the changing\ntrends in STS research, often driven by technology. Using text similarity\nmeasures we found that, in the case of STS, handbooks play no special role in\neither focusing the research efforts or marking their decline. In general, they\ndo not represent the summaries of research directions that have emerged since\nthe previous edition of the handbook.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 12:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-12"}

This can cause high amplitude signals\ncommon in higher-order modulation schemes to be clipped by the peak power\nconstraint of the light emitting diode (LED) and lead to high signal\ndistortion. In this paper we introduce Hadamard coded modulation (HCM) to\nachieve low error probabilities in LED-based VLC systems needing high average\noptical powers. This technique uses a fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT) to\nmodulate the data as an alternative modulation technique to orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM). HCM achieves a better performance for\nhigh illumination levels because of its small peak to average power ratio\n(PAPR). The power efficiency of HCM can be improved by reducing the DC part of\nthe transmitted signals without losing any information. The resulting so-called\nDC-reduced HCM (DCR-HCM) is well suited to environments requiring dimmer\nlighting as it transmits signals with lower peak amplitudes compared to HCM,\nwhich are thus subject to less nonlinear distortion. Interleaving can be\napplied to HCM to make the resulting signals more resistant against\ninter-symbol interference (ISI) in dispersive VLC links.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 13:22:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2015 20:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In this paper\nwe establish bounds on the support of the spectrum of singularities. To do\nthis, we prove a theorem that complements the famous Kolmogorov's continuity\ncriterion. The nature of these bounds helps us identify the quantities truly\nresponsible for the support of the spectrum. We then make several conclusions\nfrom this. First, specifying global scaling in terms of moments is incomplete\ndue to possible infinite moments, both of positive and negative order. For the\ncase of ergodic self-similar processes we show that negative order moments and\ntheir divergence do not affect the spectrum. On the other hand, infinite\npositive order moments make the spectrum nontrivial. In particular, we show\nthat the self-similar stationary increments process with the nontrivial\nspectrum must be heavy-tailed. This shows that for determining the spectrum it\nis crucial to capture the divergence of moments. We show that the partition\nfunction is capable of doing this and also propose a robust variant of this\nmethod for negative order moments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 14:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-12"}

In recent years, considerable\nprogress was made in explaining communities using simple and general models,\nwith neutral theory as a prominent example. However, while successful in\nexplaining static patterns such as species abundance distributions, the neutral\ntheory was criticized for making unrealistic predictions of fundamental dynamic\npatterns. Here we incorporate environmental stochasticity into the neutral\nframework, and show that the resulting generalized neutral theory is capable of\npredicting realistic patterns of both population and community dynamics.\nApplying the theory to real data (the tropical forest of Barro-Colorado\nIsland), we find that it better fits the observed distribution of short-term\nfluctuations, the temporal scaling of such fluctuations, and the decay of\ncompositional similarity with time, than the original theory, while retaining\nits power to explain static patterns of species abundance. Importantly,\nalthough the proposed theory is neutral (all species are functionally\nequivalent) and stochastic, it is a niche-based theory in the sense that\nspecies differ in their demographic responses to environmental variation. Our\nresults show that this integration of niche forces and stochasticity within a\nminimalistic neutral framework is highly successful in explaining fundamental\nstatic and dynamic characteristics of ecological communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 14:57:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-12"}

By performing\nlarge-scale calculations of the diagonal and off-diagonal hyperfine interaction\nand $gf$-values between the upper and lower hyperfine levels and using a\nsemi-empirical fitting procedure, agreement between our synthetic and\nexperimental spectra was achieved. Furthermore, we compare our results with\nobservations of stellar spectra. The spectra of the Sun and the K1.5 III red\ngiant star Arcturus were modelled in the relevant region, $1.73-1.74$ $\\mu$m\nusing our theoretically predicted $gf$-values and energies for each individual\nhyperfine line. Satisfactory fits were obtained and clear improvements were\nfound using our new data compared with the old available Mn I data. A complete\nlist of energies and $gf$-values for all the $3d^54s({^7S})4d$ e$^{6}$D $-$\n$3d^54s({^7S})4f$ w$^{6}$F hyperfine lines are available as supplementary\nmaterial online, whereas only the stronger lines are presented and discussed in\ndetail in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 15:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In regions where the\nnatural light source, i.e. solar radiation, is not sufficient for growth\noptimization, additional light sources are being used. Traditional light\nsources such as high pressure sodium lamps and other metal halide lamps are not\nvery efficient and generate high radiant heat. Therefore, new sustainable\nsolutions should be developed for energy efficient greenhouse lighting. Recent\ndevelopments in the field of light source technologies have opened up new\nperspectives for sustainable and highly efficient light sources in the form of\nlight-emitting diodes, i.e. LEDs, for greenhouse lighting. This review focuses\non the potential of LEDs to replace traditional light sources in the\ngreenhouse. In a comparative economic analysis of traditional vs. LED lighting,\nwe show that the introduction of LEDs allows reduction of the production cost\nof vegetables in the long-run of several years, due to the high energy\nefficiency, low maintenance cost and longevity of LEDs. In order to evaluate\nLEDs as a true alternative to current lighting sources, species specific plant\nresponse to different wavelengths is discussed in a comparative study.
