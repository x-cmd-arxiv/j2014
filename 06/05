The\ncouplings can be long range, provided that they decay moderately fast with\nrespect to the distance. For the solutions we construct, most of the sites are\nmoving in a neighborhood of a hyperbolic fixed point, but there are oscillating\nsites clustered around a sequence of nodes. The amplitude of these oscillations\ndoes not need to tend to zero. In particular, the almost periodic solutions do\nnot decay at infinity. We formulate an invariance equation. Solutions of this\nequation are embeddings of an invariant torus on which the motion is conjugate\nto a rotation. We show that, if there is an approximate solution of the\ninvariance equation that satisfies some non-degeneracy conditions, there is a\ntrue solution close by. The proof of this \\emph{a-posteriori} theorem is based\non a Nash-Moser iteration, which does not use transformation theory. Simpler\nversions of the scheme were developed in E.

They have been\nwidely used in large-scale optimization problems. However, stochastic gradient\nalgorithms are usually slow to converge and achieve sub-linear convergence\nrates, due to the inherent variance in the gradient computation. To accelerate\nthe convergence, some variance-reduced stochastic gradient algorithms, e.g.,\nproximal stochastic variance-reduced gradient (Prox-SVRG) algorithm, have\nrecently been proposed to solve strongly convex problems. Under the strongly\nconvex condition, these variance-reduced stochastic gradient algorithms achieve\na linear convergence rate.

A gravitational wave can interact with matter by exciting vibrations\nof elastic bodies. Earth itself is a large elastic body whose so-called\nnormal-mode oscillations ring up when a gravitational wave passes. Therefore,\nprecise measurement of vibration amplitudes can be used to search for the\nelusive gravitational-wave signals. Earth's free oscillations that can be\nobserved after high-magnitude earthquakes have been studied extensively with\ngravimeters and low-frequency seismometers over many decades leading to\ninvaluable insight into Earth's structure. Making use of our detailed\nunderstanding of Earth's normal modes, numerical models are employed for the\nfirst time to accurately calculate Earth's gravitational-wave response, and\nthereby turn a network of sensors that so far has served to improve our\nunderstanding of Earth, into an astrophysical observatory exploring our\nUniverse. In this article, we constrain the energy density of gravitational\nwaves to values in the range 0.035 - 0.15 normalized by the critical energy\ndensity of the Universe at frequencies between 0.3mHz and 5mHz, using 10 years\nof data from the gravimeter network of the Global Geodynamics Project that\ncontinuously monitors Earth's oscillations. This work is the first step towards\na systematic investigation of the sensitivity of gravimeter networks to\ngravitational waves. Further advance in gravimeter technology could improve\nsensitivity of these networks and possibly lead to gravitational-wave\ndetection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 19:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

If multiple related records generated from the same biometric\ninstance can be intercepted, their correspondence can be determined using the\ndecodability attack. In 2011, Kelkboom et al. proposed to pass the feature\nvectors through a record-specific but public permutation process in order to\nprevent this attack. In this paper, it is shown that this countermeasure\nenables another attack also analyzed by Simoens et al. in 2009 which can even\nease an adversary to fully break two related records. The attack may only be\nfeasible if the protected feature vectors have a reasonably small Hamming\ndistance; yet, implementations and security analyses must account for this\nrisk. This paper furthermore discusses that by means of a public\ntransformation, the attack cannot be prevented in a binary fuzzy commitment\nscheme based on linear codes. Fortunately, such transformations can be\ngenerated for the non-binary case.

Mass-loss on the Red\nGiant Branch (RGB) shapes the mass-distribution of the HB stars, and the color\ndistribution in turn. The physical mechanisms driving mass-loss are still\nunclear, as direct observations fail to reveal a clear correlation between\nmass-loss rate and stellar properties. The horizontal-branch mass-distribution\nis further complicated by Helium-enhanced multiple stellar populations, because\nof differences in the evolving mass along the HB. We present a simple\nanalytical mass-loss model, based on tidal stripping through Roche-Lobe\nOverFlow (RLOF) during stellar encounters. Our model naturally results in a\nnon-gaussian mass-loss distribution, with high skewness, and contains only two\nfree parameters.

It is also more computationally efficient than most\nmicrocanonical alternatives. Finally, it works for both binary and weighted\nnetworks with a variety of constraints, including combined degree-strength\nsequences and full reciprocity structure, for which no alternative method\nexists. Our canonical approach can in principle be turned into an unbiased\nmicrocanonical one, via a restriction to the relevant subset. Importantly, the\nanalysis of the fluctuations of the constraints suggests that the\nmicrocanonical and canonical versions of all the ensembles considered here are\nnot equivalent. We show various real-world applications and provide a code\nimplementing all our algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 20:05:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2014 19:54:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 14:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-23"}

It gives rise to the protected edge states in\ntwo-dimensional topological band-insulators, much like magnetic field yields\nthe integer quantum Hall effect. An outstanding question is which collective\ntopological behaviors of interacting particles are made possible by the Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling. Here we addresses one aspect of this question by exploring\nthe Rashba SU(2) analogues of vortices in superconductors. Using the\nLandau-Ginzburg approach and conservation laws, we classify the prominent\ntwo-dimensional condensates of two- and three-component spin-orbit-coupled\nbosons, and characterize their vortex excitations. There are two prominent\ntypes of condensates that take advantage of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling.\nTheir vortices exist in multiple flavors whose number is determined by the spin\nrepresentation, and interact among themselves through logarithmic or linear\npotentials as a function of distance. The vortices that interact linearly\nexhibit confinement and asymptotic freedom similar to quarks in quantum\nchromodynamics. One of the two condensate types supports small metastable\nneutral quadruplets of vortices, and their tiles as metastable vortex lattices.\nQuantum melting of such vortex lattices could give rise to non-Abelian\nfractional topological insulators, SU(2) analogues of fractional quantum Hall\nstates. The physical systems in which these states could exist are trapped two-\nand three-component bosonic ultra-cold atoms subjected to artificial gauge\nfields, as well as solid-state quantum wells made either from Kondo insulators\nsuch as SmB$_6$ or conventional topological insulators interfaced with\nconventional superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 20:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-27"}

The underlying network stack is\nbased on a communication system that was originally designed for robust\nunderwater communication. We adapt the communication system to implement covert\nand stealthy communications by utilizing the ultrasonic frequency range. We\nfurther demonstrate how the scenario of covert acoustical communication over\nthe air medium can be extended to multi-hop communications and even to wireless\nmesh networks. A covert acoustical mesh network can be conceived as a meshed\nbotnet or malnet that is accessible via inaudible audio transmissions.\nDifferent applications of covert acoustical mesh networks are presented,\nincluding the use for remote keylogging over multiple hops. It is shown that\nthe concept of a covert acoustical mesh network renders many conventional\nsecurity concepts useless, as acoustical communications are usually not\nconsidered. Finally, countermeasures against covert acoustical mesh networks\nare discussed, including the use of lowpass filtering in computing systems and\na host-based intrusion detection system for analyzing audio input and output in\norder to detect any irregularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 21:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-06"}

These languages, usually claiming to be\ndeclarative, mainly consider the conjunctive relationships among data elements.\nIn order to present the operations where the hierarchical and the disjunctive\nrelationships need to be considered, such as restructuring hierarchy and\nhandling heterogeneity, the programs in these languages often exhibit a\nprocedural style and thus the declarativeness in them is not so prominent as in\nconventional query languages like SQL.\n  In this paper, we propose a declarative pattern-based functional XML query\nlanguage named XML Tree Query (XTQ). XTQ adopts expressive composite patterns\nto present data extraction, meanwhile establishing the conjunctive, the\ndisjunctive and the hierarchical relationships among data elements. It uses the\nmatching terms, a composite structure of the variables bound to the matched\ndata elements, to present a global sketch of the extracted data, and develops a\ndeductive restructuring mechanism of matching terms to indicate data\ntransformation, especially for restructuring hierarchy and handling\nheterogeneity. Based on matching terms, XTQ employs a coherent approach to\nfunction declaration and invocation to consistently extract and construct\ncomposite data structure, which integrates features of conventional functional\nlanguages and pattern-based query languages. Additionally, XTQ also supports\ndata filtering on composite data structure such as hierarchical data, which is\nseldom deliberately considered in other studies.

In other words, all\ndwarf galaxies that now are part of the Local Group would have formed\nidentically in the early universe, but then evolved differently because of\nmorphological transformations induced by dynamical processes like galaxy\nharassment, ram pressure stripping, photo-evaporation, and so forth.

Here, we show that as the conducting bulk channels are\nsuppressed, the parasitic coupling effect diminishes and the decoupled surface\nchannels emerge as expected for ideal TIs. In Bi2Se3 thin films with fully\nsuppressed bulk states, the two surfaces, which are directly coupled below ~10\nQL, become gradually isolated with increasing thickness and are completely\ndecoupled beyond ~20 QL. On such a platform, it is now feasible to implement\ntransport devices whose functionality relies on accessing the individual\nsurface layers without any deleterious coupling effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 01:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}

Model reduction\noffers one remedy to this problem by producing simpler reduced models that are\nboth easier to analyze and faster to simulate while accurately replicating the\noriginal behavior. Interpolatory model reduction methods have emerged as\neffective candidates for very large-scale problems due to their ability to\nproduce high-fidelity (optimal in some cases) reduced models for linear and\nbilinear dynamical systems with modest computational cost. In this paper, we\nwill briefly review the interpolation framework for model reduction and\ndescribe a well studied flow control problem that requires model reduction of a\nlarge scale system of differential algebraic equations. We show that\ninterpolatory model reduction produces a feedback control strategy that matches\nthe structure of much more expensive control design methodologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 01:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

The Casimir interaction\nfree energy is derived from the zero temperature Casimir interaction energy via\nthe Matsubara formalism. In the high temperature region, the Casimir\ninteraction is dominated by the term with zero Matsubara frequency, and it is\nknown as the classical term since this term is independent of the Planck\nconstant $\\hbar$. Explicit expression of the classical term is derived and it\nis computed exactly using appropriate similarity transforms of matrices. We\nthen compute the small separation asymptotic expansion of this classical term\nup to the next-to-leading order term. For the remaining part of the finite\ntemperature Casimir interaction with nonzero Matsubara frequencies, we obtain\nits small separation asymptotic behavior by applying certain prescriptions to\nthe corresponding asymptotic expansion at zero temperature. This gives us a\nleading term that is shown to agree precisely with the proximity force\napproximation at any temperature. The next-to-leading order term at any\ntemperature is also derived and it is expressed as an infinite sum over\nintegrals. To obtain the asymptotic expansion at the low and medium temperature\nregions, we apply the inverse Mellin transform techniques. In the low\ntemperature region, we obtain results that agree with our previous work on the\nzero temperature Casimir interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 05:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We study the\ninfluence of the modified chemical composition resulting from the rotational\nmixing on the wind parameters, particularly the wind mass-loss rates. We use\nour NLTE wind code to predict the wind structure and compare the calculated\nwind mass-loss rate for the case of scaled solar chemical composition and the\ncomposition affected by the CNO cycle.

The present work\nrepresents among other things a generalization to the non Abelian case of our\nprevious result where the Abelian case was studied. In the $U(1)$ case the\ncoupling to the gauge field contains a term of the form $g(\\phi)j_\\mu (A^{\\mu}\n+\\partial^{\\mu}B)$ where $B$ is an auxiliary field and $j_\\mu$ is the Dirac\ncurrent.

As a consequence, if $\\phi$ has a soliton behavior, like defining\na bubble that connects two vacuua, we obtain that the Dirac current cannot have\na flux through the wall of the bubble, defining a confinement mechanism where\nthe fermions are kept inside those bags.

For density dependent families\nof MCs that represent the interaction of large groups of identical objects,\nKurtz has proposed two kinds of approximations. One is based on ordinary\ndifferential equations, while the other uses a diffusion process. The\ncomputational cost of the deterministic approximation is significantly lower,\nbut the diffusion approximation retains stochasticity and is able to reproduce\nrelevant random features like variance, bimodality, and tail behavior. In a\nrecent paper, for particular stochastic Petri net models, we proposed a jump\ndiffusion approximation that aims at being applicable beyond the limits of\nKurtz's diffusion approximation, namely when the process reaches the boundary\nwith non-negligible probability. Other limitations of the diffusion\napproximation in its original form are that it can provide inaccurate results\nwhen the number of objects in some groups is often or constantly low and that\nit can be applied only to pure density dependent Markov chains. In order to\novercome these drawbacks, in this paper we propose to apply the jump-diffusion\napproximation only to those components of the model that are in density\ndependent form and are associated with high population levels. The remaining\ncomponents are treated as discrete quantities. The resulting process is a\nhybrid switching jump diffusion. We show that the stochastic differential\nequations that characterize this process can be derived automatically both from\nthe description of the original Markov chains or starting from a higher level\ndescription language, like stochastic Petri nets.

In this paper, we investigate LWs driven by the power-law\nelectrons. The results show that power-law electrons with the steepness cutoff\nbehavior can excite LWs effectively because of the population inversion\ndistribution below the cutoff energy ($E_c$). The growth rate of LWs increases\nwith the steepness index ($\\delta$) and decreases with the power-law index\n($\\alpha$).

We analyse U,I\nphotometry for about 2500 globular clusters in the central regions of Hydra and\nCentaurus, based on FORS1@VLT data. We convert the measured colour-magnitude\nrelations into mass-metallicity space and obtain a scaling of Z \\propto M^{0.27\n\\pm 0.05} for Centaurus GCs and Z \\propto M^{0.40 \\pm 0.06} for Hydra GCs,\nconsistent with results in other environments. We find that the GC\nmass-metallicity relation already sets in at present-day masses of a few 10^5\nsolar masses and is well established in the luminosity range of massive MW\nclusters like omega Centauri. We compare the mass-metallicity relation with\npredictions from the star cluster self-enrichment model by Bailin & Harris\n(2009). For this we include effects of dynamical and stellar evolution and a\nphysically well motivated primordial mass-radius scaling. The self-enrichment\nmodel reproduces the observed relations well for average primordial half-light\nradii r_h ~ 1-1.5 pc, star formation efficiencies f_* ~ 0.3-0.4, and\npre-enrichment levels of [Fe/H] ~ -1.7 dex.

The vast triangular skyrmion lattice phase that is\nstabilized by an external magnetic field evolves continuously as a function of\nincreasing $A$ into a regime in which nearest-neighbor skyrmions start\noverlapping with each other. This overlap leads to a continuous reduction of\nthe skyrmion number from its quantized value $Q=1$ and to the emergence of\nantivortices at the center of the triangles formed by nearest-neighbor\nskyrmions. The antivortices also carry a small \"skyrmion number\" $Q_A \\ll 1$\nthat grows as a function of increasing $A$. The system undergoes a first order\nphase transition into a square vortex-antivortex lattice at a critical value of\n$A$. Finally, a canted ferromagnetic state becomes stable through another first\norder transition for a large enough anisotropy $A$. Interestingly enough, this\nfirst order transition is accompanied by {\\it metastable} meron solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 15:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 16:19:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 15:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-08"}

To deal\nwith schemas, we propose an algorithm that computes a mapping capable of\nobtaining a global schema which is a conservative extension of original local\nschemas. The role of the obtained mapping is then twofold: it ensures schema\nevolution, via composition and inversion, and it guides the construction of a\ndocument translator, allowing automatic data adaptation w.r.t. type evolution.\nThis paper applies, extends and put together some of our previous\ncontributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 15:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-06"}

The Joint Research Centre has developed an\nintegrated model to provide a macro-scale set of indices to evaluate the\nconnectivity of the Natura 2000 network, which forms the backbone of a Green\nInfrastructure for Europe. The model allows a wide assessment and comparison to\nbe performed across countries in terms of structural (spatially connected or\nisolated sites) and functional connectivity (least-cost distances between sites\ninfluenced by distribution, distance and land cover).\n  Main conclusion: The Natura 2000 network in Europe shows differences among\ncountries in terms of the sizes and numbers of sites, their distribution as\nwell as distances between sites. Connectivity has been assessed on the basis of\na 500 m average inter-site distance, roads and intensive land use as barrier\neffects as well as the presence of \"green\" corridors. In all countries the\nNatura 2000 network is mostly made of sites which are not physically connected.\nHighest functional connectivity values are found for Spain, Slovakia, Romania\nand Bulgaria. The more natural landscape in Sweden and Finland does not result\nin high inter-site network connectivity due to large inter-site distances. The\ndistribution of subnets with respect to roads explains the higher share of\nisolated subnets in Portugal than in Belgium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 10:13:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 12:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-23"}

We provide a graph-theoretic bound on this ratio, and subsequently\nobtain a tight characterization of the smallest eigenvalue for certain classes\nof graphs. Specifically, for Erdos-Renyi random graphs, we show that when a\n(sufficiently small) set $S$ of rows and columns is removed from the Laplacian,\nand the probability $p$ of adding an edge is sufficiently large, the smallest\neigenvalue of the grounded Laplacian asymptotically almost surely approaches\n$|S|p$.
