Recent numerical simulations with microphysical equation of\nstate suggest the outcome of such events depends on the mass of the neutron\nstars. For less massive systems, simulations favor the formation of a\nhypermassive, quasi-stable neutron star, whose oscillations produce a short,\nhigh frequency burst of gravitational radiation. Its dominant frequency content\nis tightly correlated with the radius of the neutron star, and its measurement\ncan be used to constrain the supranuclear equation of state.

Genus $g\\leq3$ contributions are constructed\nexplicitly for a general class of effective actions associated with a\nspecial-K\\\"ahler target space and are shown to satisfy the holomorphic anomaly\nequation of perturbative type-II topological string theory. This identification\nof a topological string free energy from an effective action is primarily based\non conceptual arguments and does not involve any of its more specific\nproperties. It is fully consistent with known results. A general theorem is\npresented that captures some characteristic features of the equivalence, which\ndemonstrates at the same time that non-holomorphic deformations of special\ngeometry can be dealt with consistently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 18:30:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 18:45:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 10:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Suggested interpretations explain the THz spectral component, but do not\naccount for the simultaneous microwave component. We present a mechanism for\nproducing the observed double-spectra. Based on coherent enhancement of\nsynchrotron emission at long wavelengths in laboratory accelerators, we\nconsider how similar processes may occur within a solar flare. The instability\nknown as microbunching arises from perturbations that produce electron beam\ndensity modulations, giving rise to broadband coherent synchrotron emission at\nwavelengths comparable to the characteristic size of the microbunch structure.\nThe spectral intensity of this coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) can far\nexceed that of the incoherent synchrotron radiation (ISR), which peaks at\nhigher frequency, thus producing a double-peaked spectrum. Successful CSR\nsimulations are shown to fit actual burst spectral observations, using typical\nflaring physical parameters and power-law energy distributions for the\naccelerated electrons. The simulations consider an energy threshold below which\nmicrobunching is not possible because of Coulomb repulsion. Only a small\nfraction of the radiating charges accelerated to energies above the threshold\nis required to produce the microwave component observed for several events. The\nISR-CSR mechanism can occur together with other emission processes producing\nthe microwave component. It may bring an important contribution at microwaves\nat least for certain events where physical conditions for the occurrence of the\nISR-CSR microbunching mechanism are possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 19:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Here we show that for large\ngrains (size >0.1 micron, containing most grain mass) in sufficiently large\nmolecular clouds (radii >1-10 pc, masses >10^4 M_sun), this scale becomes\nlarger than the characteristic sizes of pre-stellar cores (the sonic length),\nso large fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio are imprinted on cores.

This naturally predicts populations of carbon-enhanced stars,\ncertain highly unusual stellar populations observed in nearby open clusters,\nand may explain the 'UV upturn' in early-type galaxies. It will also\ndramatically change planet formation in the resulting protostellar disks, by\npreferentially 'seeding' disks with an enhancement in large carbonaceous or\nsilicate grains. The relevant threshold for this behavior scales simply with\ncloud densities and temperatures, making straightforward predictions for\nclusters in starbursts and high-redshift galaxies. Because of the selective\nsorting by size, this process is not necessarily visible in extinction mapping.\nWe also predict the shape of the abundance distribution -- when these\nfluctuations occur, a small fraction of the cores may actually be seeded with\nabundances ~100 times the mean, such that they are almost 'totally metal'\n(Z~1)!

Digital cancellation is one of the lowest complexity\nself-interference cancellation techniques in full-duplex systems. However, its\nmitigation capability is very limited, mainly due to transmitter and receiver\ncircuit's impairments. In this paper, we propose a novel digital\nself-interference cancellation technique for full-duplex systems. The proposed\ntechnique is shown to significantly mitigate the self-interference signal as\nwell as the associated transmitter and receiver impairments. In the proposed\ntechnique, an auxiliary receiver chain is used to obtain a digital-domain copy\nof the transmitted Radio Frequency (RF) self-interference signal. The\nself-interference copy is then used in the digital-domain to cancel out both\nthe self-interference signal and the associated impairments. Furthermore, to\nalleviate the receiver phase noise effect, a common oscillator is shared\nbetween the auxiliary and ordinary receiver chains. A thorough analytical and\nnumerical analysis for the effect of the transmitter and receiver impairments\non the cancellation capability of the proposed technique is presented.

The evolution of the polar field is a consequence of Hale's\npolarity rules, together with the tilt angle distribution which has a\nsystematic component (Joy's law) and a random component (tilt-angle scatter).\nWe determine the scatter using the observed tilt angle data and study the\neffects of this scatter on the evolution of the solar surface field using SFT\nsimulations with flux input based upon the recorded sunspot groups. The tilt\nangle scatter is described in our simulations by a random component according\nto the observed distributions for different ranges of sunspot group size (total\numbral area). By performing simulations with a number of different realizations\nof the scatter we study the effect of the tilt angle scatter on the global\nmagnetic field, especially on the evolution of the axial dipole moment. The\naverage axial dipole moment at the end of cycle 17 (a medium-amplitude cycle)\nfrom our simulations was 2.73G. The tilt angle scatter leads to an uncertainty\nof 0.78 G (standard deviation). We also considered cycle 14 (a weak cycle) and\ncycle 19 (a strong cycle) and show that the standard deviation of the axial\ndipole moment is similar for all three cycles. The uncertainty mainly results\nfrom the big sunspot groups which emerge near the equator. In the framework of\nBabcock-Leighton dynamo models, the tilt angle scatter therefore constitutes a\nsignificant random factor in the cycle-to-cycle amplitude variability, which\nstrongly limits the predictability of solar activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jun 2014 01:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The groups are in a\nnarrow mass range about $10^{13}M_\\odot$, a mass scale at which the interplay\nbetween the DIM and the group member galaxies is still largely unprobed. X-ray\nemission from the DIM is detected in the energy band 0.5--2 keV with flux $\\le\n10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$, which is one order of magnitude fainter than\nfor typical ROSAT groups (RASS). For many groups we set upper limits to the\nX-ray luminosity, indicating that the detections are likely probing the upper\nenvelope of the X-ray emitting groups. We find evidence for our optically\nselected groups to be under-luminous with respect to predictions from X-ray\nscaling relations. X-ray mass determinations are in best agreement with those\nbased on the member galaxies bulge luminosity, followed by their total optical\nluminosity and velocity dispersion.

Extending this pilot program to a larger sample of\ngroups is mandatory to unveil any imprint of interaction between member\ngalaxies and DIM in halo potentials of key importance for\nenvironmentally-driven galactic evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jun 2014 09:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

We show the\nimportance of the surface coverage: for the O+O reaction, the chemical\ndesorption efficiency is close to 80 $\\%$ at zero coverage and tends to zero at\none monolayer coverage. The coverage dependence of O+O chemical desorption is\nproved by varying the amount of pre-adsorbed N$_2$ on the substrate from 0 to\n1.5 ML.

But thanks to\nthe high number of known exoplanets, it is now possible to look at them as a\npopulation that puts statistical constraints on theoretical models. A method\nthat uses these constraints is planetary population synthesis. Its key element\nis a global model of planet formation and evolution that directly predicts\nobservable planetary properties based on properties of the natal protoplanetary\ndisk. To do so, global models build on many specialized models that address one\nspecific physical process. We thoroughly review the physics of the sub-models\nincluded in global formation models. The sub-models can be classified as models\ndescribing the protoplanetary disk (gas and solids), the (proto)planet (solid\ncore, gaseous envelope, and atmosphere), and finally the interactions\n(migration and N-body interaction). We compare the approaches in different\nglobal models and identify physical processes that require improved\ndescriptions in future. We then address important results of population\nsynthesis like the planetary mass function or the mass-radius relation. In\nthese results, the global effects of physical mechanisms occurring during\nplanet formation and evolution become apparent, and specialized models\ndescribing them can be put to the observational test. Due to their nature as\nmeta models, global models depend on the development of the field of planet\nformation theory as a whole. Because there are important uncertainties in this\ntheory, it is likely that global models will in future undergo significant\nmodifications. Despite this, they can already now yield many testable\npredictions. With future global models addressing the geophysical\ncharacteristics, it should eventually become possible to make predictions about\nthe habitability of planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jun 2014 12:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The equation of state of SQM under a constant magnetic field\nis obtained self-consistently and the pressure perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield is shown to be larger than that parallel to the magnetic field, implying\nthat the properties of magnetized QSs generally depend on both the strength and\nthe orientation of the magnetic fields distributed inside the stars. Using a\ndensity-dependent magnetic field profile which is introduced to mimic the\nmagnetic field strength distribution in a star, we study the properties of\nstatic spherical QSs by assuming two extreme cases for the magnetic field\norientation in the stars, i.e., the radial orientation in which the local\nmagnetic fields are along the radial direction and the transverse orientation\nin which the local magnetic fields are randomly oriented but perpendicular to\nthe radial direction. Our results indicate that including the magnetic fields\nwith radial (transverse) orientation can significantly decrease (increase) the\nmaximum mass of QSs, demonstrating the importance of the magnetic field\norientation inside the magnetized compact stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jun 2014 13:37:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 02:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

Besides the particular\nclustering algorithm, the different term weighting functions applied to the\nselected features to represent web document is a main aspect in clustering\ntask.

Such estimators for conjugate gradient algorithms used\nto solve symmetric positive definite linear systems exist. This work presents\nerror estimation for iterative solutions of general indefinite linear systems\nto provide accurate stopping and restarting criteria. In many realistic\napplications no properties of the matrices are known a priori; thus requiring\nsuch a general algorithm. Our method for approximating the required quadratic\nform of the residue (square of the A-norm of the error vector) when solving\nnonsymmetric linear systems with Bi-Conjugate Gradient (BiCG) algorithm, needs\nonly O(1) time (per BiCG iteration). We also extend this estimate to\napproximate l2 norm of error vector using the relations of Hestenes and\nStiefel. Using the heuristics of numerical results we observe that the\ndeveloped algorithm (BiCGQL) is at least k/10 times more accurate than residue\nvector based stopping criteria (where k is the condition number of the system).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jun 2014 13:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-27"}

Torres","title":"Robust Fault Diagnosis for Pipelines","comments":"This article has some errors","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"math.OC","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  This paper presents the design of a diagnosis system for the detection,\nidentification and reconstruction of faults in pipelines. The design of such\ndiagnosis system is based on redundant relations and nonlinear observers,\ntaking into account faults in sensors, damages in pumps, and unknown\nextractions. The proposed algorithm is developed based on a model described by\nnonlinear equations of the fluid behavior in a pipeline, considering the\nprinciples of conservation of mass and momentum. In order to distinguish among\ndifferent types of faults and to reconstruct their behavior, the diagnosis\nsystem operates in stages. The first stage called detection & fault isolation\naims to isolate a fault symptom with a set of redundant relations deduced from\nthe analysis of the model in nominal conditions and assuming measurements of\nthe standard variables at the extremes of the pipeline. In the second stage\nnamed fault reconstruction, nonlinear observation algorithms estimate the\ntemporal evolution of the isolated fault. The complete diagnosis system is\nvalidated through a series of experiments in a hydraulic pilot pipeline of 200\n[m].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 21:38:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 03:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}
