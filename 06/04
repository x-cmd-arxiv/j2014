However, clustering\nmeasurements depend strongly on the \"mask\" that removes low-quality data and\ndescribes the sky and selection function. We find that applying a robust,\nconservative mask to WISE-selected quasars yields a weaker but still\nsignificant difference in the bias between obscured and unobscured quasars.\nThese findings are consistent with results from previous Spitzer surveys, and\nremoves any scale dependence of the bias.

Only clusters of sufficiently large initial population and size undergo\nthe combined interior contraction and exterior expansion that leads eventually\nto core collapse. In all other systems, core collapse is frustrated by binary\nheating. These clusters globally expand for their entire lives, up to the point\nof tidal disruption.\n  Using a suite of direct N-body calculations, we trace the \"collapse line\" in\nr_v-N space that separates these two paths.

However, recent reports suggest this two-dimensional material\nmay harbor some unique properties, making it a viable candidate for use in\noptoelectronic and semiconducting devices. Whereas on one hand, graphene is\nhighly transparent due to its atomic thickness, the material does exhibit a\nstrong interaction with photons. This has clear advantages over existing\nmaterials used in photonic devices such as Indium-based compounds. Moreover,\nthe material can be used to 'trap' light and alter the incident wavelength,\nforming the basis of the plasmonic devices. We also highlight upon graphene's\nnonlinear optical response to an applied electric field, and the phenomenon of\nsaturable absorption. Within the context of logical devices, graphene has no\ndiscernible band-gap. Therefore, generating one will be of utmost importance.\nAmongst many others, some existing methods to open this band-gap include\nchemical doping, deformation of the honeycomb structure, or the use of carbon\nnanotubes (CNTs). We shall also discuss various designs of transistors,\nincluding those which incorporate CNTs, and others which exploit the idea of\nquantum tunneling. A key advantage of the CNT transistor is that ballistic\ntransport occurs throughout the CNT channel, with short channel effects being\nminimized. We shall also discuss recent developments of the graphene tunneling\ntransistor, with emphasis being placed upon its operational mechanism. Finally,\nwe provide perspective for incorporating graphene within high frequency\ndevices, which do not require a pre-defined band-gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 18:30:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-04"}

The curvature drift drives parallel heating\nthrough Fermi reflection while the gradient B drift changes the perpendicular\nenergy through betatron acceleration. We present simulations in which we\nevaluate each of these mechanisms in space and time in order to quantify their\nrole in electron heating. For a case with a small guide field (20 % of the\nmagnitude of the reconnecting component) the curvature drift is the dominant\nsource of electron heating. However, for a larger guide field (equal to the\nmagnitude of the reconnecting component) electron acceleration by the curvature\ndrift is comparable to that of the parallel electric field. In both cases the\nheating by the gradient B drift is negligible in magnitude. Heating by the\ncurvature-drift dominates in the outflow exhausts where bent field lines expand\nto relax their tension and is therefore distributed over a large area.

Acceleration\nby parallel electric fields may play a smaller role in large systems where the\nX-line occupies a vanishing fraction of the system. The curvature drift and the\nparallel electric field dominate the dynamics and drive parallel heating.

Methods have\nbeen developed with a variety of names and motivations in many fields, and\nperhaps as a result the connections between all these methods have not been\nhighlighted. Here we survey methods from this disparate literature as\noptimization programs over matrix manifolds. We discuss principal component\nanalysis, factor analysis, linear multidimensional scaling, Fisher's linear\ndiscriminant analysis, canonical correlations analysis, maximum autocorrelation\nfactors, slow feature analysis, sufficient dimensionality reduction,\nundercomplete independent component analysis, linear regression, distance\nmetric learning, and more. This optimization framework gives insight to some\nrarely discussed shortcomings of well-known methods, such as the suboptimality\nof certain eigenvector solutions. Modern techniques for optimization over\nmatrix manifolds enable a generic linear dimensionality reduction solver, which\naccepts as input data and an objective to be optimized, and returns, as output,\nan optimal low-dimensional projection of the data. This simple optimization\nframework further allows straightforward generalizations and novel variants of\nclassical methods, which we demonstrate here by creating an\northogonal-projection canonical correlations analysis.

With specific details varying from source to source,\ncommon explanations for the features have ranged from atomic transitions in the\nmagnetized atmospheres or condensed surface, to cyclotron lines generated in a\nhot ionized layer near the surface. Here we quantitatively evaluate the X-ray\nspectral distortions induced by inhomogeneous temperature distributions of the\nneutron star surface.

Methods: We have\ncollected multi epochs spectra for all of the targets in our sample.

Finally,\nwe show that planets around evolved stars have lower orbital eccentricities\nthan those orbiting solar-type stars, which suggests that they are either\nformed in different conditions or that their orbits are efficiently\ncircularized by interactions with the host star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 21:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Radio signals provide complementary information to that obtained\nfrom Auger surface detectors, which are predominantly sensitive to the particle\ncontent of an air shower at the surface.

In such optical fibers, the light is guided over\nlong distances by continuous total internal reflection which occurs at the\ninterface between the fiber core with a higher refractive index and the lower\nindex cladding. Although this mechanism ensures that no light escapes from the\nwaveguide, it gives rise to an evanescent field in the cladding. While this\nfield is protected from interacting with the environment in standard optical\nfibers, it is routinely employed in air- or vacuum-clad fibers in order to\nefficiently couple light fields to optical components or emitters using, e.g.,\ntapered optical fiber couplers. Remarkably, the strong confinement imposed by\nthe latter can lead to significant coupling of the light's spin and orbital\nangular momentum. Taking advantage of this effect, we demonstrate the\ncontrolled directional spontaneous emission of light by quantum emitters into a\nsub-wavelength-diameter waveguide. The effect is investigated in a paradigmatic\nsetting, comprising cesium atoms which are located in the vicinity of a\nvacuum-clad silica nanofiber.

This has the added benefit of allowing methods to be adopted\nand adapted for other purposes. In the field of e-Science, services -- often\nchoreographed through workflow, process data to generate results. The\nreproduction of results is often not straightforward as the computational\nobjects may not be made available or may have been updated since the results\nwere generated. For example, services are often updated to fix bugs or improve\nalgorithms. This paper addresses these problems in three ways. Firstly, it\nintroduces a new framework to clarify the range of meanings of\n\"reproducibility\". Secondly, it describes a new algorithm, \\PDIFF, that uses a\ncomparison of workflow provenance traces to determine whether an experiment has\nbeen reproduced; the main innovation is that if this is not the case then the\nspecific point(s) of divergence are identified through graph analysis,\nassisting any researcher wishing to understand those differences. One key\nfeature is support for user-defined, semantic data comparison operators.\nFinally, the paper describes an implementation of \\PDIFF that leverages the\npower of the e-Science Central platform which enacts workflows in the cloud. As\nwell as automatically generating a provenance trace for consumption by \\PDIFF,\nthe platform supports the storage and re-use of old versions of workflows, data\nand services; the paper shows how this can be powerfully exploited in order to\nachieve reproduction and re-use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 23:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-05"}

The explosive system studied is an ideal\ngas with a single exothermic reaction governed by a pressure-dependent reaction\nrate ($p^n$) with a pressure exponent of $n = 3$. A pressure-dependent reaction\nrate, rather than the exponential dependence of reaction on temperature of\nArrhenius kinetics, is used so that the detonation wave is stable in the\nhomogeneous case and can be modelled with simple, analytical techniques, and\nthus the effect of introducing heterogeneity can be clearly identified. The\ntwo-dimensional slab of explosive is bounded by a layer of inert gas with the\nsame thermodynamic properties as the explosive. The heterogeneity is introduced\ninto the explosive via a large-amplitude, two-dimensional sinusoidal ripple in\ndensity in the initialization of the simulation, while maintaining a constant\npressure. The computational simulations are initialized with a ZND solution for\nthe ideal CJ detonation, and the detonation is allowed to propagate into the\nexplosive layer. The simulations show that the detonation in the heterogeneous\nmedia exhibits a cellular-like structure of complex shock interactions. The\ndetonation is able to propagate into a significantly thinner layer of explosive\nand can exhibit a greater velocity than the corresponding homogeneous case. A\nparametric study of varying the wavelength of the sinusoid shows the existence\nof an optimal size of heterogeneity at which the favorable effect is the\ngreatest corresponding to a wavelength that is approximately 10 to 50 times the\nhalf reaction zone length of the ideal CJ detonation. As the wavelength is\ndecreased to the size of the reaction zone length, the behavior reverts back to\nthe homogeneous case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 02:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-05"}

In this work we use as sources the high-resolution archival\nabsorption-line ultraviolet and optical spectra of stars, whose warm\ntemperatures favor moderate Fe I excitation. We derive the energy for a\nparticular upper level in Kurucz's semiempirical calculations by adopting a\ntrial value that yields the same wavelength for a given line predicted to be\nabout as strong as that of a strong unidentified spectral line observed in the\nstellar spectra, then checking the new wavelengths of other strong predicted\ntransitions that share the same upper level for coincidence with other strong\nobserved unidentified lines. To date this analysis has provided the upper\nenergies of 66 Fe I levels. Many new level energies are higher than those\naccessible to laboratory experiments; several exceed the Fe I ionization\nenergy.

Specifically, we show\nthat the strings produced in $D3/D7$ are of local axionic type and we place\nconstraints on the tension while arguing that the supersymmetry breaking\nmechanism of the model needs to be altered according to supergravity\nconstraints on constant Fayet-Iliopoulos terms.

A unitary ring of square matrices\nis an associative hypercomplex algebra by definition. Since only the algebraic\nproperties and relations of the elements matter, we replace the matrices by\nbiquaternions. In this paper, we first consider the basics of non-relativistic\nand relativistic QT. Then we introduce general hypercomplex algebras and also\nshow how a relativistic quantum equation like Dirac's one can be formulated\nusing biquaternions. Subsequently, some algebraic preconditions for operations\nwithin hypercomplex algebras and their subalgebras will be examined. For our\npurpose equations akin to Schr\\\"odinger's should be able to be set up and\nsolved. Functions of complementary variables should be Fourier transforms of\neach other. This should hold within a purely non-real subspace which must hence\nbe a subalgebra. Furthermore, it is an ideal denoted by $\\mathcal{J}$. It must\nbe isomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}$, hence containing an internal identity element.\nThe bicomplex numbers will turn out to fulfil these preconditions, and\ntherefore, the formalism of QT can be developed within its subalgebras. We also\nshow that bicomplex numbers encourage the definition of several different kinds\nof conjugates. One of these treats the elements of $\\mathcal{J}$ like the usual\nconjugate treats complex numbers.

However, Dempster shows that the PLR (with\ninner threshold 1) is equal to the frequentist p-value in the simple Gaussian\ncase. In 1997, Aitkin extends this result by adding a nuisance parameter and\nshowing its asymptotic validity under more general distributions.

These values were put into context alongside the\nresults from asteroseismic models. The effective temperature, Teff, of HD\n144277 was determined as 8640(+300)(-100) K, log g is 4.14 +/- 0.15 and the\nprojected rotational velocity, vsini, is 62.0 +/- 2.0 km/s.

The fundamental parameters derived from asteroseismology, Teff,\nlog g, L/Lsun and R\\Rsun, agree within one sigma to the values found from\nspectroscopic analysis. As the vsini value is significantly higher than assumed\nin the first analysis, near-degeneracies and rotational mode coupling were\ntaken into account in the new models. These suggest that HD 144277 has an\nequatorial rotational velocity of about 80 km/s and is seen equator-on.

The hydraulic conductivities corresponding to the mechanical\nproperties at these two scales are different. In the bulk elastic host rock,\nthe hydraulic conductivity does not vary much with the deformation, while it\nsignificantly changes in the lower scale of the localization zone due to\ninelastic deformation. Increase of permeability due to fracture and/or\ndilation, or reduction of permeability due to material compaction can take\nplace inside this zone. The challenge is to predict the evolution of hydraulic\nconductivities coupled with the mechanical behaviour of the material in all\nstages of the deformation process. In the early stage of diffuse deformation,\nthe permeability of the material can be reasonably assumed to be homogenous\nover the whole Representative Volume Element (RVE) However, localized failure\nresults in distinctly different conductivities in different parts of the RVE.\nThis paper establishes a general framework and corresponding field equations to\ndescribe the hydro-mechanical coupling in both diffuse and localized stages of\ndeformation in rocks. In particular, embedding the lower scale hydro-mechanical\nbehaviour of the localization zone inside an elastic bulk, together with their\ncorresponding effective sizes, helps effectively deal with scaling issues in\nlarge-scale modelling. Preliminary results are presented which demonstrate the\npromising features of this new approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 14:18:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 08:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-06"}

The calculation is carried out under the bad cavity limit, the\nadiabatic approximation of a slowly varying amplitude of the cavity mode, and\nwith the assumption of driving the cavity mode with a blue detuned strong laser\npulse. Under such conditions, explicit expressions of the bipartite and\ntripartite steering parameters are obtained, and the concept of collective\ntripartite quantum steering, recently introduced by He and Reid [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 111, 250403 (2013)], is clearly explored. It is found that both bipartite\nand tripartite steering parameters are sensitive functions of the initial state\nof the modes and distinctly different steering behaviour could be observed\ndepending on whether the modes were initially in a thermal state or not. We\nfind that the initial thermal noise is more effective in destroying the\nbipartite rather than the tripartite steering which, on the other hand, can\npersist even for a large thermal noise. For the initial vacuum state of a\nsteered mode, the tripartite steering exists over the entire interaction time\neven if the steering modes are in very noisy thermal states. When the steered\nmode is initially in a thermal state, it can be collectively steered by the\nother modes. There are thresholds for the average number of the thermal photons\nabove which the existing tripartite steering appears as the collective\nsteering.

Despite\ntheir conceptual differences, practical implementations of these methods differ\nin just two respects: the choice of the Parrinello-Rahman mass matrix and\nwhether or not a thermostat is applied to the internal modes of the ring\npolymer during the dynamics. Here we explore a method which is halfway between\nthe two approximations: we keep the path integral bead masses equal to the\nphysical particle masses but attach a Langevin thermostat to the internal modes\nof the ring polymer during the dynamics. We justify this by showing\nanalytically that the inclusion of an internal mode thermostat does not affect\nany of the desirable features of RPMD: thermostatted RPMD (TRPMD) is equally\nvalid with respect to everything that has actually been proven about the method\nas RPMD itself. In particular, because of the choice of bead masses, the\nresulting method is still optimum in the short-time limit, and the transition\nstate approximation to its reaction rate theory remains closely related to the\nsemiclassical instanton approximation in the deep quantum tunneling regime. In\neffect, there is a continuous family of methods with these properties,\nparameterised by the strength of the Langevin friction. Here we explore\nnumerically how the approximation to quantum dynamics depends on this friction,\nwith a particular emphasis on vibrational spectroscopy. We find that a broad\nrange of frictions approaching optimal damping give similar results, and that\nthese results are immune to both the resonance problem of RPMD and the\ncurvature problem of CMD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 15:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-04"}

In this paper, we argue that diversity, not direct diversity on\nsamples but adaptive diversity with data, is highly correlated to ensemble\naccuracy, and we propose a novel technology for classifier ensemble, learning\nto diversify, which learns to adaptively combine classifiers by considering\nboth accuracy and diversity. Specifically, our approach, Learning TO Diversify\nvia Weighted Kernels (L2DWK), performs classifier combination by optimizing a\ndirect but simple criterion: maximizing ensemble accuracy and adaptive\ndiversity simultaneously by minimizing a convex loss function. Given a measure\nformulation, the diversity is calculated with weighted kernels (i.e., the\ndiversity is measured on the component classifiers' outputs which are kernelled\nand weighted), and the kernel weights are automatically learned. We minimize\nthis loss function by estimating the kernel weights in conjunction with the\nclassifier weights, and propose a self-training algorithm for conducting this\nconvex optimization procedure iteratively. Extensive experiments on a variety\nof 32 UCI classification benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art ensembles such as Bagging, AdaBoost,\nRandom Forests, Gasen, Regularized Selective Ensemble, and Ensemble Pruning via\nSemi-Definite Programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 09:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-06"}

They contribute to the ultraviolet (UV) flux variations\nover the solar cycle and hence may influence the Earth's climate. Here we\ncombine high-resolution UV and spectro-polarimetric observations of BPs by the\nSUNRISE observatory with 3D radiation MHD simulations. Full spectral line\nsyntheses are performed with the MHD data and a careful degradation is applied\nto take into account all relevant instrumental effects of the observations. It\nis demonstrated that the MHD simulations reproduce the measured distributions\nof intensity at multiple wavelengths, line-of-sight velocity, spectral line\nwidth, and polarization degree rather well. Furthermore, the properties of\nobserved BPs are compared with synthetic ones. These match also relatively\nwell, except that the observations display a tail of large and strongly\npolarized BPs not found in the simulations. The higher spatial resolution of\nthe simulations has a significant effect, leading to smaller and more numerous\nBPs. The observation that most BPs are weakly polarized is explained mainly by\nthe spatial degradation, the stray light contamination, and the temperature\nsensitivity of the Fe I line at 5250.2 \\AA{}. The Stokes $V$ asymmetries of the\nBPs increase with the distance to their center in both observations and\nsimulations, consistent with the classical picture of a production of the\nasymmetry in the canopy. This is the first time that this has been found also\nin the internetwork. Almost vertical kilo-Gauss fields are found for 98 % of\nthe synthetic BPs. At the continuum formation height, the simulated BPs are on\naverage 190 K hotter than the mean quiet Sun, their mean BP field strength is\n1750 G, supporting the flux-tube paradigm to describe BPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 07:24:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2014 07:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}

A founder, with\nCharles Darwin, of the discipline of comparative psychology, George Romanes\nconsidered the minds of animals as ejects, an idea that could be generalized to\n'society as eject' and, ultimately, 'the world as an eject' - mind in the\nuniverse.

Indeed, the need to manage documents during\nall the life cycle is an important issue. For that, the need to enhance the\nability of document management systems is an interesting challenge. Despite\nexisting systems on market (electronic document management systems), they are\nconsidered as non-flexible systems which are based on data models preventing\nany extension or improvement. In addition, those systems do not allow a slight\ndescription of documents elements and propose an insufficient mechanisms for\nboth links and consistency management. LIRIS laboratory has developed research\nin this area and proposed an active system, termed SAGED, whose objectives is\nto manage link and consistency using active rules. However SAGED is based on an\napproach that split rules (for consistency management) and documents\ndescription. The main drawback is the rigidity of such approach which is\nhighlighted whenever documents are moved from one server to another or during\nexchanges of documents. To contribute to solve this problem, we propose to\ndevelop an approach aiming at improve the document management including\nconsistency. This approach is based on the introduction of rules with the XML\ndescription of the documents [BoCP01]. In this context we proposed a\nXML-oriented storage level allowing the storing of documents and rules\nuniformly through a native XML database. We defined an intelligent system\ntermed SIGED according a client/server architecture built around an intelligent\ncomponent for active rules execution. These rules are extracted from XML\ndocument, compiled and executed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 20:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-06"}
