Knowledge of this process comes from a combination of astronomical\nobservations and laboratory simulations under astrophysically relevant\nconditions. For the first time we present the results of temperature programmed\ndesorption (TPD) experiments with pre-cometary ice analogs composed of up to\nfive molecular components: H2 O, CO, CO2, CH3 OH, and NH3 . The experiments\nwere performed with an ultra-high vacuum chamber. A gas line with a novel\ndesign allows the controlled preparation of mixtures with up to five molecular\ncomponents. Volatiles desorbing to the gas phase were monitored using a\nquadrupole mass spectrometer, while changes in the ice structure and\ncomposition were studied by means of infrared spectroscopy. The TPD curves of\nwater ice containing CO, CO2, CH3 OH, and NH3 present desorption peaks at\ntemperatures near those observed in pure ice experiments, volcano desorption\npeaks after water ice crystallization, and co-desorption peaks with water.\nDesorption peaks of CH3 OH and NH3 at temperatures similar to the pure ices\ntakes place when their abundance relative to water is above 3%, approx., in the\nice matrix. We found that CO, CO2, and NH3 also present co-desorption peaks\nwith CH3 OH, which cannot be reproduced in experiments with binary water-rich\nice mixtures. These are extensively used in the study of thermal desorption of\ninterstellar ices. These results reproduce the heating of circumstellar ices in\nhot cores and can be also applied to the late thermal evo- lution of comets. In\nparticular, TPD curves represent a benchmark for the analysis of the\nmeasurements that mass spectrometers on board the ESA-Rosetta cometary mission\nwill perform on the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which will be\nactive before the arrival of Rosetta according to our predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2014 16:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-03"}

But, a recent advent of big data\ntechnology facilitates development of new systems that sacrifice the DBMS\nfunctionality in order to efficiently manage large-scale data. Those so-called\nNoSQL systems use a distributed file system, which support scalability and\nreliability. They support scalability of the system by storing data into a\nlarge number of low-cost commodity hardware and support reliability by storing\nthe data in replica. However, they have a drawback that they do not adequately\nsupport high-level DBMS functionality. In this paper, we propose an\narchitecture of a DBMS that uses the DFS as storage. With this novel\narchitecture, the DBMS is capable of supporting scalability and reliability of\nthe DFS as well as high-level functionality of DBMS. Thus, a DBMS can utilize a\nvirtually unlimited storage space provided by the DFS, rendering it to be\nsuitable for big data analytics. As part of the architecture of the DBMS, we\npropose the notion of the meta DFS file, which allows the DBMS to use the DFS\nas the storage, and an efficient transaction management method including\nrecovery and concurrency control. We implement this architecture in\nOdysseus/DFS, an integration of the Odysseus relational DBMS, that has been\nbeing developed at KAIST for over 24 years, with the DFS. Our experiments on\ntransaction processing show that, due to the high-level functionality of\nOdysseus/DFS, it outperforms Hbase, which is a representative open-source NoSQL\nsystem. We also show that, compared with an RDBMS with local storage, the\nperformance of Odysseus/DFS is comparable or marginally degraded, showing that\nthe overhead of Odysseus/DFS for supporting scalability by using the DFS as the\nstorage is not significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2014 16:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-03"}

This technique is particularly attractive for a\ncomparison of the two transitions because distinct features in the spectra can\nbe associated with the direct and indirect gaps. However, detailed modeling of\nthese room temperature spectra is required to extract the band gap values with\nthe high accuracy required to determine the Sn concentration $y_{c}$ at which\nthe alloy becomes a direct gap semiconductor. For the direct gap, this is\naccomplished using a microscopic model that allows the determination of direct\ngap energies with meV accuracy. For the indirect gap, it is shown that current\ntheoretical models are inadequate to describe the emission properties of\nsystems with close indirect and direct transitions. Accordingly, an ad hoc\nprocedure is used to extract the indirect gap energies from the data. For $y$ <\n0.1 the resulting direct gap compositional dependence is given by $\\Delta E_{0}\n= -(3.57 \\pm 0.06)y$ (in eV). For the indirect gap, the corresponding\nexpression is $\\Delta E_{\\text{ind}} = -(1.64\\pm 0.10)y$ (in eV).

A characteristic\nfeature of vacuum energy is that it has a pressure with the same amplitude, but\nopposite sign to its energy density, while all the precision tests of General\nRelativity are either in vacuum, or for media with negligible pressure.\nTherefore, one may wonder whether an anomalous coupling to pressure might be\nresponsible for decoupling vacuum from gravity. We test this possibility in the\ncontext of the \\textit{Gravitational Aether} proposal, using current\ncosmological observations, which probe the gravity of relativistic pressure in\nthe radiation era. Interestingly, we find that the best fit for anomalous\npressure coupling is about half-way between General Relativity (GR), and\nGravitational Aether (GA), if we include \\textit{Planck} together with\n\\textit{WMAP} and BICEP2 polarization cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nobservations. Taken at face value, this data combination excludes both GR and\nGA at around the 3-sigma level. However, including higher resolution CMB\nobservations (\"highL\") or baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) pushes the best\nfit closer to GR, excluding the Gravitational Aether solution to the\ncosmological constant problem at the 4--5-sigma level. This constraint\neffectively places a limit on the anomalous coupling to pressure in the\nparametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) expansion, $\\zeta_4 = 0.105 \\pm 0.049$\n(+highL CMB), or $\\zeta_4 = 0.066 \\pm 0.039$ (+BAO).

We also determine the\nexplicit, leading order forms of a family of excited states and show how to\ncompute their quantum corrections as smooth, globally defined functions on the\nBianchi IX minisuperspace. These excited-state solutions are peaked away from\nthe minisuperspace origin and are labeled by a pair of positive integers that\ncan be plausibly interpreted as graviton excitation numbers for the two\nindependent anisotropy degrees of freedom. The modified semi-classical method\nused here is applicable to more general models, representing a significant\nprogress in the Wheeler-DeWitt approach to quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2014 19:24:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 16:15:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 02:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-11"}

In the\ncontext of thermal surface radiation from a rotating neutron star, a\nconventional polar cap model can reproduce the broad, large-amplitude X-ray\npulse only with a \"pencil plus fan\" beam emission pattern, which is\ncharacteristic of strongly magnetized ($\\gtrsim$10^12 Gauss) neutron star\natmospheres, substantially stronger than the ~10^10 Gauss external dipole field\ninferred from the pulsar spin-down rate.

For Milky Way-mass halos, we use high-resolution, zoom-in\nsimulations to explore the effects of decays on Galactic substructure. In\ngeneral, halos with circular velocities comparable to the magnitude of kick\nvelocity are most strongly affected by decays. We show that decaying dark\nmatter models with lifetimes comparable to Hubble time and recoil speeds about\n20-40 km/s can significantly reduce both the abundance of Galactic subhalos and\nthe internal densities of the subhalos.

Our conclusion is that multimodal biofeedback can have a relevant\nimpact in terms of added depth, depending on the way it is used inside the\ngame.

We then show through\na direct comparison to a homogeneous sample of observed disk galaxies with\nmeasured brightness profiles, rotation velocity curves and internal velocity\ndispersion profiles, that the critical radii at which brightness profiles dip\nbelow the exponential fit, are much more accurately predicted by $Q_{M}$ than\nby the $Q$ of classical gravity.

Using the Mopra radio telescope, we observed the ground\nrotational transitions of HCO+, H13CO+, HCN, H13CN, HNC, and N2H+. These data\nare complemented with near-infrared extinction maps to constrain the column\ndensities, effective dust temperatures derived from Herschel data, and\nNH3-based gas kinetic temperatures. Results: The target cores are located\nacross the nebula, span visual extinctions between 5 and 67 mag, and effective\ndust temperatures (averaged along the lines of sight) between 13 and 19 K. The\nextinction-normalized integrated line intensities, a proxy for the abundance in\nconstant excitation conditions of optically thin lines, vary within an order of\nmagnitude for a given molecule. The effective dust temperatures and gas kinetic\ntemperatures are correlated, but the effective dust temperatures are\nconsistently higher than the gas kinetic temperatures. Combining the molecular\nline and temperature data, we find that N2H+ is only detected toward the\ncoldest and densest cores while other lines show no correlation with these core\nproperties. Conclusions: Within this large sample, N2H+ is the only species to\nexclusively trace the coldest and densest cores, in agreement with chemical\nconsiderations. In contrast, the common high-density tracers HCN and HNC are\npresent in a majority of cores, demonstrating the utility of these molecules to\ncharacterize cores over a large range of extinctions. The correlation between\nthe effective dust temperatures and the gas kinetic temperatures suggests that\nthe former are dominated by dust that is both dense and thermodynamically\ncoupled to the dense gas traced by NH3.

The MS distribution is in very good agreement with that\nseen on the RGB, with ~30% of the stars belonging to the second population.\nThere is also evidence for two sequences in the red horizontal branch, but this\nappears to be unrelated to the MPs in this cluster.

Thus, canonical donor stars in CVs are generally\nlow-mass stars of spectral type M. However, several CVs have been observed\ncontaining secondary stars which are too hot for their inferred masses. This\nparticular configuration can be explained if the donor stars in these systems\nunderwent significant nuclear evolution before they reached contact. In this\npaper we present SDSSJ001153.08-064739.2 as an additional example belonging to\nthis peculiar type of CV and discuss in detail its evolutionary history. We\nperform spectroscopic and photometric observations and make use of available\nCatalina Real-Time Transient Survey photometry to measure the orbital period of\nSDSSJ001153.08-064739.2 as 2.4 hours and estimate the white dwarf\n(Mwd>0.65Msun) and donor star (0.21Msun<Mdon<0.45Msun) masses, the mass ratio\n(q = 0.32 +- 0.08), the orbital inclination (47 degrees < i < 70 degrees),\nderive an accurate orbital ephemeris (T0 = 2453383.578 + E x 0.10028081), and\nreport the detection of an outburst.

The\nmost widely used approach to this problem is to convert strings into numerical\nvectors using string kernels and subsequently apply a support vector machine\nthat works in a numerical vector space. However, this non-one-to-one conversion\ninvolves a loss of information and makes it impossible to evaluate, using\nprobability theory, the generalization error of a learning machine, considering\nthat the given data to train and test the machine are strings generated\naccording to probability laws. In this study, we approach this classification\nproblem by constructing a classifier that works in a set of strings. To\nevaluate the generalization error of such a classifier theoretically,\nprobability theory for strings is required. Therefore, we first extend a limit\ntheorem on the asymptotic behavior of a consensus sequence of strings, which is\nthe counterpart of the mean of numerical vectors, as demonstrated in the\nprobability theory on a metric space of strings developed by one of the authors\nand his colleague in a previous study [18].

A parallel processing job can be delayed\nsubstantially as long as one of its many tasks is being assigned to a failing\nmachine. To tackle this so-called straggler problem, most parallel processing\nframeworks such as MapReduce have adopted various strategies under which the\nsystem may speculatively launch additional copies of the same task if its\nprogress is abnormally slow or simply because extra idling resource is\navailable. In this paper, we focus on the design of speculative execution\nschemes for a parallel processing cluster under different loading conditions.\nFor the lightly loaded case, we analyze and propose two optimization-based\nschemes, namely, the Smart Cloning Algorithm (SCA) which is based on maximizing\nthe job utility and the Straggler Detection Algorithm (SDA) which minimizes the\noverall resource consumption of a job. We also derive the workload threshold\nunder which SCA or SDA should be used for speculative execution. Our simulation\nresults show both SCA and SDA can reduce the job flowtime by nearly 60%\ncomparing to the speculative execution strategy of Microsoft Mantri. For the\nheavily loaded case, we propose the Enhanced Speculative Execution (ESE)\nalgorithm which is an extension of the Microsoft Mantri scheme. We show that\nthe ESE algorithm can beat the Mantri baseline scheme by 18% in terms of job\nflowtime while consuming the same amount of resource.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 07:44:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 08:25:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 04:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-06"}

The new X-ray transient\nwas first detected on 2012 May 31 by MAXI Gas Slit Camera (GSC) and Swift Burst\nAlert Telescope (BAT) almost simultaneously. We analyzed X-ray and UV data for\n270 days since the outburst onset taken by repeated MAXI scans and Swift\npointing observations. The obtained X-ray light curve for the inital 90 days is\nroughly represented by a fast-rise and exponential-decay profile. However, it\nre-brightened on the ~110 days after the onset and finally went down below both\nGSC and BAT detec- tion limits on the 240 day. All the X-ray energy spectra are\nfitted well with a model consisting of a multi-color-disk blackbody and its\nComptonized hard tail. During the soft-state periods, the inner-disk radius of\nthe best-fit model were almost constant. If the radius represents the innermost\nstable circular orbit of a non-spinning black hole and the soft-to-hard\ntransitions occur at 1-4% of the Eddington luminosity, the mass of the compact\nobject is estimated to be > 2.9Mo and the distance to be > 1.70 kpc. The\ninner-disk radius became larger in the hard / hard-intermediate state. This\nsuggests that the accretion disk would be truncated. We detected an excess of\nthe UV flux over the disk blackbody component extrapolated from the X-ray data,\nwhich can be modelled as reprocessed emission irradiated by the inner disk. We\nalso found that the UV light curve mostly traced the X-ray curve, but a short\ndipping event was observed in both the UV and the X-ray bands with a 3.5-day\nX-ray time lag.

The\napproach to estimate the interfacial tension from the free energy excess of a\nsystem with interfaces relative to corresponding single-phase systems does not\nsuffer from the first problem but still suffers from the latter. Considering\n$d$-dimensional systems with interfacial area $L^{d-1}$ and linear dimension\n$L_z$ in the direction perpendicular to the interface, it is argued that the\ninterfacial fluctuations cause logarithmic finite-size effects of order $\\ln\n(L) / L^{d-1}$ and order $\\ln (L_z)/L ^{d-1}$, in addition to regular\ncorrections (with leading order $\\text{const}/L^{d-1}$). A phenomenological\ntheory predicts that the prefactors of the logarithmic terms are universal (but\ndepend on the applied boundary conditions and the considered statistical\nensemble). The physical origin of these corrections are the translational\nentropy of the interface as a whole, \"domain breathing\" (coupling of\ninterfacial fluctuations to the bulk order parameter fluctuations of the\ncoexisting domains), and capillary waves.

We adopt a multifaceted approach where we examine how\nthe number of observational constraints as well as the uncertainties on\nobservations and on model input physics impact the age-dating and weighing. We\nmodelled the exoplanet host-star HD52265, a MS, solar-like oscillator observed\nby CoRoT. We considered different sets of observational constraints (HR data,\nmetallicity, seismic constraints). For each case, we determined the age, mass,\nand properties of HD52265 inferred from models, and quantified the impact of\nthe models inputs. Our seismic analysis provides an age A=2.10-2.54 Gyr, a mass\nM=1.14-1.32 Msun, and a radius R=1.30-1.34 Rsun, which corresponds to\nuncertainties of 10, 7, and 1.5% respectively. Our seismic study provides\nconstraints on surface convection, through the mixing-length found to be 12-15%\nsmaller than the solar one.

The seismic mass of the exoplanet is\nfound to be Mp sin i=1.17-1.26 MJup, much more precise than what can be derived\nby HR diagram inversion. We demonstrate that asteroseismology allows to improve\nthe age accuracy compared to other methods. We emphasize that the knowledge of\nthe mean properties of oscillations -as the large frequency separation- is not\nenough for deriving accurate ages.

We discuss experiments by turn,\nstarting with interference of massive objects like macromolecules and\nmicro-mechanical resonators, followed by self-interference of single particles\nin complex molecules, before examining the striking advances made with\nsuperconducting qubits. Finally, we propose a theoretical basis for quantifying\nthe macroscopic features of a system to lay the ground for a more systematic\ncomparison of the quantum properties in disparate systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 10:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

A class of nonlinear Schrodinger models with\narbitrary power nonlinearity is analyzed. We conceive the various regimes of\nbehavior, depending on the topology of resonance-overlap in phase space,\nranging from a fully developed chaos involving Levy flights to pseudochaotic\ndynamics at the onset of delocalization. It is demonstrated that quadratic\nnonlinearity plays a dynamically very distinguished role in that it is the only\ntype of power nonlinearity permitting an abrupt localization-delocalization\ntransition with unlimited spreading already at the delocalization border. We\ndescribe this localization-delocalization transition as a percolation\ntransition on a Cayley tree. It is found in vicinity of the criticality that\nthe spreading of the wave field is subdiffusive in the limit\nt\\rightarrow+\\infty. The second moment grows with time as a powerlaw t^\\alpha,\nwith \\alpha = 1/3.

In a theory with superluminal modes, an\nanalysis of causality based on null curves makes no sense, and thus, we need to\nanalyze them in a different way. In this paper, using the method of the\ncharacteristics, we analyze the causal structure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We\nhave the result that, on a Killing horizon, gravitons can propagate in the null\ndirection tangent to the Killing horizon. Therefore, a Killing horizon can be a\ncausal edge as in the case of general relativity, i.e. a Killing horizon is the\n\"event horizon\" in the sense of causality. We also analyze causal structures on\nnonstationary solutions with $(D-2)$-dimensional maximal symmetry, including\nspherically symmetric and flat spaces. If the geometrical null energy\ncondition, $R_{AB}N^AN^B \\ge 0$ for any null vector $N^A$, is satisfied, the\nradial velocity of gravitons must be less than or equal to that of light.\nHowever, if the geometrical null energy condition is violated, gravitons can\npropagate faster than light. Hence, on an evaporating black hole where the\ngeometrical null energy condition is expected not to hold, classical gravitons\ncan escape from the \"black hole\" defined with null curves. That is, the causal\nstructures become nontrivial. It may be one of the possible solutions for the\ninformation loss paradox of evaporating black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 11:55:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 00:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-04"}

This paper presents kinetic models of\nhow ion cyclotron waves heat protons on their journey from the corona to\ninterplanetary space. It also derives a wide range of new solutions for the\nrelevant dispersion relations, marginal stability boundaries, and nonresonant\nvelocity-space diffusion rates. A phenomenological model containing both\ncyclotron damping and turbulent cascade is constructed to explain the\nsuppression of proton heating at low alpha-proton differential flow speeds.\nThese effects are implemented in a large-scale model of proton thermal\nevolution from the corona to 1 AU. A Monte Carlo ensemble of realistic wind\nspeeds, densities, magnetic field strengths, and heating rates produces a\nfilled region of parameter space (in a plane described by the parallel plasma\nbeta and the proton temperature anisotropy ratio) similar to what is measured.\nThe high-beta edges of this filled region are governed by plasma instabilities\nand strong heating rates. The low-beta edges correspond to weaker proton\nheating and a range of relative contributions from cyclotron resonance. On\nbalance, the models are consistent with other studies that find only a small\nfraction of the turbulent power spectrum needs to consist of ion cyclotron\nwaves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 12:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The chemistry is calculated\nalong the accretion flow from the outer disk inwards using a comprehensive\nnetwork. Two simulations are performed, one beginning with complex ices and one\nwith simple ices only. For the isolated disk, COMs are transported without\nmajor alteration into the inner disk where they thermally desorb into the gas\nreaching an abundance representative of the initial assumed ice abundance. For\nsimple ices, COMs efficiently form on grain surfaces under the conditions in\nthe outer disk. Gas-phase COMs are released into the molecular layer via\nphotodesorption. For the irradiated disk, complex ices are also transported\ninwards; however, they undergo thermal processing caused by the warmer\nconditions in the irradiated disk which tends to reduce their abundance along\nthe accretion flow. For simple ices, grain-surface chemistry cannot synthesise\nCOMs in the outer disk because the necessary grain-surface radicals, which tend\nto be particularly volatile, are not sufficiently abundant on the grain\nsurfaces. Gas-phase COMs are formed in the inner region of the irradiated disk\nvia gas-phase chemistry induced by the desorption of strongly bound molecules\nsuch as methanol; hence, the abundances are not representative of the initial\nmolecular abundances injected into the outer disk. These results suggest that\nthe composition of comets formed in isolated disks may differ from those formed\nin externally irradiated disks with the latter composed of more simple ices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 12:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-04"}

Detecting\nsources from measured data is difficult because of low signal to noise ratio\n(S/N) of spectra, large and highly varying background due to naturally\noccurring radioactive material (NORM), and line broadening due to limited\nspectral resolution of nuclear detector. We have invented a method for\ndetection of sources using clustering of spectral data. Our method takes\nadvantage of the physical fact that a source not only produces counts in the\nregion of its spectral emission, but also has the effect on the entire detector\nspectrum via Compton continuum. This allows characterizing the low S/N spectrum\nwithout distinct isotopic lines using multiple data features. We have shown\nthat noisy spectra with low S/N can be grouped by overall spectral shape\nsimilarity using a data clustering technique called Dynamic Quantum Clustering\n(DQC). The spectra in the same cluster can then be averaged to enhance S/N of\nthe isotopic spectral line. This would allow for increased accuracy of isotopic\nidentification and lower false alarm rate.

The formalism also yields the Uehling shift of the\nhydrogenic spectrum, the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron to leading\norder in the fine structure constant, the Lamb shift and the axial anomaly of\nQED.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 15:29:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Aug 2014 18:25:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 17:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-28"}

However, in a CeC system\nwith a bunched electron beam, inevitably, a long-range longitudinal space\ncharge force is introduced. For a relatively dense electron beam, its force can\nbe comparable to, or even greater than the attractive force from the ions.\nHence, the influence of the space charge field on the modulation process could\nbe important. If the 3-D Debye lengths are much smaller than the extension of\nthe electron bunch, the modulation induced by the ion happens locally. Then, in\nthat case, we can approximate the long-range longitudinal space charge field as\na uniform electric field across the region. As detailed in this paper, we\ndeveloped an analytical model to study the dynamics of ion shielding in the\npresence of a uniform electric field. We solved the coupled Vlasov-Poisson\nequation system for an infinite anisotropic electron plasma, and estimated the\ninfluences of the longitudinal space charge field to the modulation process for\nthe experimental proof of the CeC principle at RHIC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 15:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The correct form of this\nmethod takes into account both the internal energy in the jet and the ion\nrest-mass energy associated with the bulk motion. The latter was neglected in a\nnumber of papers, which instead adopted the well-known energy-content\nminimization method. That method was developed for static sources, for which\nthere is no bulk-motion component of the energy. In the case of electron\npower-law spectra with index >2 in ion-electron jets, the rest-mass component\ndominates. The minimization method for the jet power taking it into account was\nconsidered in some other work, but only based on either an assumption of a\nconstant total synchrotron flux or a fixed range of the Lorentz factors.\nInstead, we base our method on an observed optically-thin synchrotron spectrum.\nWe find the minimum jet power is independent of its radius when the ion\nrest-mass power dominates, which becomes the case below certain critical\nradius. This allows for robust minimum power estimates. We also present results\nfor the case with observed turnover frequency, at which the source becomes\noptically thick. This method allows a determination of the source size, in\naddition to the power and the magnetic field. We also point out that when the\nion rest-mass power dominates, the estimates of the minimum power lead to very\ndifferent equipartition parameters than those based on minimization of the\nenergy content. The former and latter lead to approximate equipartition between\nthe internal energy in magnetic field and in particles including and excluding,\nrespectively, their rest mass energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 15:48:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 13:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The morphology of the\n[FeII] emission is remarkably similar to that of the [SII] emission, and the\nrelative positions of [FeII] and [SII] peaks are shifted according to proper\nmotion measurements, which were previously derived from HST images. An analysis\nof the [FeII]/[SII] emission ratio shows that Fe gas abundance is much lower\nthan the solar value with up to 90% of Fe depletion in the inner jet knots.\nThis confirms previous findings on dusty jets, where shocks are not efficient\nenough to remove refractory species from grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 15:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

For instance, we shall see that the drift\ncharacterization of Liouville groups, due to Kaimanovich-Vershik and\nKarlsson-Ledrappier (and to Varopoulos in some important special cases) admits\na very short and quite elementary proof. Furthermore, we give a new, and rather\nshort proof of (a weak version of) an observation of Kaimanovich (as well as a\nsmall strengthening thereof) that the Poisson boundary of any symmetric\nmeasured group $(G,\\mu)$, is doubly ergodic, and the diagonal $G$-action on its\nproduct is ergodic with unitary coefficients. We also offer a characterization\nof weak mixing for ergodic $(G,\\mu)$-spaces parallel to the measure-preserving\ncase.\n  We shed some new light on Nagaev's classical technique to prove central limit\ntheorems for random walks on groups. In the interesting special case when the\nmeasured group admits a product current, we define a Besov space structure on\nthe space of bounded harmonic functions with respect to which the the\nassociated convolution operator is quasicompact without any assumptions on\nfinite exponential moments. For Gromov hyperbolic measured groups, this gives\nan alternative proof of the fact that every H\\\"older continuous function with\nzero integral with respect to the unique stationary probability measure on the\nGromov boundary is a co-boundary.\n  Finally, we give a new and almost self-contained proof of a special case of a\nrecent combinatorial result about piecewise syndeticity of product sets in\ngroups by the author and A.

These are little-known virtual\nmasses present in the vacuum state of quantum gravity. A couple of equal masses\nof this kind can be excited by an oscillating coherent source with frequency f\nand decays to its ground state emitting a virtual graviton, which can propagate\nand transfer momentum p to ordinary matter. The virtual masses recoil in the\nemission, and this amounts to a transfer of momentum -p to the vacuum; this\nmomentum can be passed in turn to some matter, or not. The energy hf for the\nprocess does not come from the vacuum, but from the coherent source. The ratio\nhf/p is of the order of 1 m/s. This model was developed to explain experimental\nresults showing the emission of anomalous high-momentum radiation from certain\nsuperconductors, sometimes with a strong recoil of the emitters. The recoil is\nenergetically quite efficient, at least at small power, and could be exploited\nfor propulsion. It has not been tested in space, however, and our model cannot\nyet predict if the recoil is affected by the presence of near matter. (Another\nmodel predicts that it is not.) We also briefly mention a possible application\nof the anomalous radiation itself and we evaluate the (large) electric and\nmagnetic field strength needed to produce an effect equivalent to that of a\nsuperconducting emitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2014 11:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-21"}
