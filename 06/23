When\nrate coefficients are unknown, they are often estimated using known values from\nother systems. The most common example is to use He-collider rate coefficients\nto estimate values for other colliders, typically H$_2$, using scaling\narguments based on the reduced mass of the collision system. This procedure is\noften justified by the assumption that the inelastic cross section is\nindependent of the collider. Here we explore the validity of this approach\nfocusing on rotational inelastic transitions for collisions of H, para-H$_2$,\n$^3$He, and $^4$He with CO in its vibrational ground state. We compare rate\ncoefficients obtained via explicit calculations to those deduced by standard\nreduced-mass scaling. Not surprisingly, inelastic cross sections and rate\ncoefficients are found to depend sensitively on both the reduced mass and the\ninteraction potential energy surface. We demonstrate that standard reduced-mass\nscaling is not valid on physical and mathematical grounds, and as a\nconsequence, the common approach of multiplying a rate coefficient for a\nmolecule-He collision system by the constant factor of ~1.4 to estimate the\nrate coefficient for para-H$_2$ collisions is deemed unreliable. Furthermore,\nwe test an alternative analytic scaling approach based on the strength of the\ninteraction potential and the reduced mass of the collision systems. Any\nscaling approach, however, may be problematic when low-energy resonances are\npresent; explicit calculations or measurements of rate coefficients are to be\npreferred.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jun 2014 19:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Our aim was to separate\nchanges produced by short-term ENSO variations and to look on temporal and\nspatial dynamics of residual temperature anomalies. For this we subtract linear\ninfluence of ENSO index from each HadCRUT4 grid box. We found that residual\nglobal temperature dynamics looks like staircase function: linear trends for\nthree quasi-stable periods 1950-1987, 1988-1997 and 1998-2013 are near zero and\nnear all warming occurred during two shifts of 1987/1988 and 1997/1998 years.\n  All these allows us to formulate a new hypothesis about recent warming - the\nShifts Hypothesis. It explains the structure of recent warming as follows:\nduring shifts of 1987/1988 and 1997/1998 the mean value of global temperature\nquickly rose, over which natural variability associated with ENSO, PDO and many\nother local factors occurs.\n  According to IPCC forcing-response paradigm warming process (WP) cleared from\nall factors should be continuous warming (may be near linear on the considered\ntime interval). This idea is inconsistent to the obtained staircase function.\nThis staircase function may be explained by current IPCC forcing-response\nparadigm only if it happened so that the combination of compensating factors is\nnear the same as anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) forcing for each\nquasi-stable period - 1950-1987, 1988-1997 and 1998-2013.

We identify a family of admissible contracts for which\nthe optimal agent's action is explicitly characterized, and, using the recent\ntheory of singular changes of measures for It\\^o processes, we study how\nrestrictive this family is. In particular, in the special case of the standard\nHomlstr\\\"om-Milgrom model with fixed volatility, the family includes all\npossible contracts. We solve the principal-agent problem in the case of CARA\npreferences, and show that the optimal contract is linear in these factors: the\ncontractible sources of risk, including the output, the quadratic variation of\nthe output and the cross-variations between the output and the contractible\nrisk sources. Thus, like sample Sharpe ratios used in practice, path-dependent\ncontracts naturally arise when there is moral hazard with respect to risk\nmanagement. In a numerical example, we show that the loss of efficiency can be\nsignificant if the principal does not use the quadratic variation component of\nthe optimal contract.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 10:12:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 17:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

However, in some systems entanglement can be dominated by\n\"internal\", possibly gauged, degrees of freedom that are not spatially\norganized, and that can give rise to gaps smaller than the inverse size of the\nsystem. In a holographic context, such small gaps are associated to the\nappearance of horizons and singularities in the dual spacetime. Here, we\npropose a concept of entwinement, which is intended to capture this fine\nstructure of the wavefunction. Holographically, entwinement probes the\nentanglement shadow -- the region of spacetime not probed by the minimal\nsurfaces that compute spatial entanglement in the dual field theory. We\nconsider the simplest example of this scenario -- a 2d conformal field theory\n(CFT) that is dual to a conical defect in AdS3 space. Following our previous\nwork, we show that spatial entanglement in the CFT reproduces spacetime\ngeometry up to a finite distance from the conical defect. We then show that the\ninterior geometry up to the defect can be reconstructed from entwinement that\nis sensitive to the discretely gauged, fractionated degrees of freedom of the\nCFT. Entwinement in the CFT is related to non-minimal geodesics in the conical\ndefect geometry, suggesting a potential quantum information theoretic meaning\nfor these objects in a holographic context.

We draw local reionization histories as a function of time\nand investigate variations according to the halo mass progenitors of the\nregions. We then extrapolate the halo mass inside the region from high z to z=0\nto make predictions about the reionization histories of z=0 galaxies. We found\nthat the later an HII region appears, the smaller will be its related lifetime\nand volume before it sees the global UV background. Quantitatively the duration\nand the extent of the initial growth of an HII region is strongly dependent on\nthe mass of the inner halo and can be as long as 50 % of the reionization\nepoch. We found that the most massive is a halo today, the earlier it appears\nand the larger are the extension and the duration of propagation of its HII\nregion.

Since\nour population size $N=\\infty$, we call our selection small rather than weak\nwhich usually means $w =O(1/N)$.\n  The key to studying these games is the fact that when the dynamics are\nsuitably rescaled in space and time they convergence to solutions of a reaction\ndiffusion equation (RDE). Inspired by work of Ohtsuki and Nowak and Tarnita et\nal we show that the reaction term is the replicator equation for a modified\ngame matrix and the modifications of the game matrix depend on the interaction\nkernel only through the values of two or three simple probabilities for an\nassociated coalescing random walk.\n  Two strategy games lead to an RDE with a cubic nonlinearity, so we can\ndescribe the phase diagram completely. Three strategy games lead to a pair of\ncoupled RDE, but using an idea from our earlier work, we are able to show that\nif there is a repelling function for the replicator equation for the modified\ngame, then there is coexistence in the spatial game when selection is small.\nThis enables us to prove coexistence in the spatial model in a wide variety of\nexamples where the replicator equation of the modified game has an attracting\nequilibrium with all components positive.

This\ncorresponds to determine the shape of the correlation function, its possible\nevolution with redshift and the size and amplitude of large scale structures.\nDifferent selection effects, inevitably entering in any observation, introduce\nimportant constraints in the measurement of correlations. In the context of\ngalaxy redshift surveys selection effects can be caused by observational\ntechniques and strategies and by implicit assumptions used in the data\nanalysis. Generally all these effects are taken into account by using\npair-counting algorithms to measure two-point correlations. We review these\nmethods stressing that they are based on the a-priori assumption that galaxy\ndistribution is spatially homogeneous inside a given sample. We show that, when\nthis assumption is not satisfied by the data, results of the correlation\nanalysis are affected by finite size effects.In order to quantify these\neffects, we introduce a new method based on the computation of the gradient of\ngalaxy counts along tiny cylinders. We show, by using artificial homogeneous\nand inhomogeneous point distributions, that this method is to identify redshift\ndependent selection effects and to disentangle them from the presence of large\nscale density fluctuations. We then apply this new method to several redshift\ncatalogs and we find evidences that galaxy distribution, in those samples where\nselection effects are small enough, is characterized by power-law correlations\nwith exponent $\\gamma=0.9$ up to $20$ Mpc/h followed by a change of slope that,\nin the range [20,100] Mpc/h, corresponds to a power-law exponent $\\gamma=0.25$.\nWhether a crossover to spatial unformity occurs at $\\sim 100$ Mpc/h cannot be\nclarified by the present data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 13:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-18"}

Many important $\\alpha$-particle induced reactions for nuclear\nastrophysics may only be measured using indirect techniques due to small cross\nsections at the energy of interest. One of such indirect technique, is to\ndetermine the Asymptotic Normalization Coefficients (ANC) for near threshold\nresonances extracted from sub-Coulomb $\\alpha$-transfer reactions. This\napproach provides a very valuable tool for studies of astrophysically important\nreaction rates since the results are practically model independent. However,\nthe validity of the method has not been directly verified.\n  Purpose. The aim of this letter is to verify the technique using the\n$^{16}$O($^6$Li,$d$)$^{20}$Ne reaction as a benchmark. The $^{20}$Ne nucleus\nhas a well known $1^-$ state at excitation energy of 5.79 MeV with a width of\n28 eV.

The 1$^-$ state at 5.79 MeV is studied using the $\\alpha$-transfer\nreaction $^{16}$O($^6$Li,$d$)$^{20}$Ne at sub-Coulomb energies.\n  Results.

Although networks describe a variety of\nconsequential social structures, statistical methods for studying affiliation\nnetworks are less well developed than methods for studying one-mode, or\nactor-actor, networks. One way to analyze affiliation networks is to consider\none-mode network matrices that are derived from an affiliation network, but\nthis approach may lead to the loss of important structural features of the\ndata. The most comprehensive approach is to study both actors and events\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we extend the bilinear mixed-effects model, a\ntype of latent space model developed for one-mode networks, to the affiliation\nnetwork setting by considering the dependence patterns in the interactions\nbetween actors and events and describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for\nBayesian inference.

We then introduce an\nexact method, called KisSplice, to extract alternative splicing events.\nFinally, we show that it enables to identify more correct events than general\npurpose transcriptome assemblers.\n  In order to deal with ever-increasing volumes of NGS data, we put an extra\neffort to make KisSplice as scalable as possible. First, to improve its running\ntime, we propose a new polynomial delay algorithm to enumerate bubbles. We show\nthat it is several orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches. Then,\nto reduce its memory consumption, we propose a new compact way to build and\nrepresent a de Bruijn graph. We show that our approach uses 30% to 40% less\nmemory than the state of the art, with an insignificant impact on the\nconstruction time.\n  Additionally, we apply the same techniques developed to list bubbles in two\nclassical problems: cycle enumeration and the K-shortest paths problem. We give\nthe first optimal algorithm to list cycles in undirected graphs, improving over\nJohnson's algorithm. This is the first improvement to this problem in almost 40\nyears. We then consider a different parameterization of the classical\nK-shortest (simple) paths problem: instead of bounding the number of st-paths,\nwe bound the weight of the st-paths. We present new algorithms with the same\ntime complexities but using exponentially less memory than previous approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 11:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-25"}

Those events tend to\nincreasingly occur when $k$ or $d$ increases, or when performing several\nrestarts. First, we show that those special events are a blessing because they\nallow to partially re-seed some cluster centers while further minimizing the\n$k$-means objective function. Second, we describe a novel heuristic,\nmerge-and-split $k$-means, that consists in merging two clusters and splitting\nthis merged cluster again with two new centers provided it improves the\n$k$-means objective. This novel heuristic can improve Hartigan's $k$-means when\nit has converged to a local minimum. We show empirically that this\nmerge-and-split $k$-means improves over the Hartigan's heuristic which is the\n{\\em de facto} method of choice.
