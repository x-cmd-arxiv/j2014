This remarkable performance is mediated by the representation\nformed in inferior temporal (IT) cortex. In parallel, recent advances in\nmachine learning have led to ever higher performing models of object\nrecognition using artificial deep neural networks (DNNs). It remains unclear,\nhowever, whether the representational performance of DNNs rivals that of the\nbrain. To accurately produce such a comparison, a major difficulty has been a\nunifying metric that accounts for experimental limitations such as the amount\nof noise, the number of neural recording sites, and the number trials, and\ncomputational limitations such as the complexity of the decoding classifier and\nthe number of classifier training examples. In this work we perform a direct\ncomparison that corrects for these experimental limitations and computational\nconsiderations. As part of our methodology, we propose an extension of \"kernel\nanalysis\" that measures the generalization accuracy as a function of\nrepresentational complexity. Our evaluations show that, unlike previous\nbio-inspired models, the latest DNNs rival the representational performance of\nIT cortex on this visual object recognition task. Furthermore, we show that\nmodels that perform well on measures of representational performance also\nperform well on measures of representational similarity to IT and on measures\nof predicting individual IT multi-unit responses. Whether these DNNs rely on\ncomputational mechanisms similar to the primate visual system is yet to be\ndetermined, but, unlike all previous bio-inspired models, that possibility\ncannot be ruled out merely on representational performance grounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 16:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We discuss how it can be\ndetermined by the combination of direct and indirect searches for additional\nHiggs bosons at future collider experiments. First of all, we evaluate expected\nexcluded regions for the mass of additional neutral Higgs bosons from direct\nsearches at the LHC with the 14 TeV collision energy in the two Higgs doublet\nmodels with a softly-broken $Z_2$ symmetry. Second, precision measurements of\nthe Higgs boson couplings at future experiments can be used for the indirect\nsearch of extended Higgs sectors if measured coupling constant with the gauge\nboson slightly deviates from the standard model value. In particular, in the\ntwo Higgs doublet model with the softly-broken discrete symmetry, there are\nfour types of Yukawa interactions, so that they can be discriminated by\nmeasuring the pattern of deviations in Yukawa coupling constants. Furthermore,\nwe can fingerprint various extended Higgs sectors with future precision data by\ndetecting the pattern of deviations in the coupling constants of the\nstandard-model-like Higgs boson. We demonstrate how the pattern of deviations\ncan be different among various Higgs sectors which predict the electroweak rho\nparameter to be unity; such as models with additional an isospin singlet, a\ndoublet, triplets or a septet. We conclude that as long as the gauge coupling\nconstant of the Higgs boson slightly differs from the standard model prediction\nbut is enough to be detected at the LHC and its high-luminosity run or at the\nInternational Linear Collider, we can identify the non-minimal Higgs sector\neven without direct discovery of additional Higgs bosons at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 17:36:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Nov 2014 03:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In\nthis paper, we study the long-term evolution of disc warp and precession for\ndiscs with dimensionless thickness $H/r$ larger than their viscosity parameter\n$\\alpha$, such that bending waves can propagate and dominate the warp\nevolution. For small warps, these discs undergo approximately rigid-body\nprecession. We derive analytical expressions for the warp/twist profiles of the\ndisc and the alignment timescale for a variety of models. Applying our results\nto circumbinary discs, we find that these discs align with the orbital plane of\nthe binary on a timescale comparable to the global precession time of the disc,\nand typically much smaller than its viscous timescale. We discuss the\nimplications of our finding for the observations of misaligned circumbinary\ndiscs (such as KH 15D) and circumbinary planetary systems (such as Kepler-413);\nthese observed misalignments provide useful constraints on the uncertain\naspects of the disc warp theory.

The star forming gas has a\nvelocity dispersion 317+-30 km/s, amongst the highest ever measured. It is\nsimilar to the stellar velocity dispersions of the putative descendants of\nGOODS-N-774, compact quiescent galaxies at z~2 and giant elliptical galaxies in\nthe nearby Universe. Galaxies such as GOODS-N-774 appear to be rare; however,\nfrom the star formation rate and size of the galaxy we infer that many star\nforming cores may be heavily obscured, and could be missed in optical and\nnear-infrared surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 20:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Since it was shown that the spin axis vector can be aligned by the YORP\neffect, such a behavior should be seen on asteroid pairs, if they were indeed\nformed by the described mechanism. Alternatively, if the pairs were formed by a\ncollision, the spin axes should have a random direction and small or young\nbodies might have a tumbling rotation.\n  Here I apply the lightcurve inversion method on self-obtained photometric\ndata, in order to derive the rotation axis vectors and shape models of the\nasteroid pairs 2110, 3749, 5026, 6070, 7343 and 44612.

Using this method,\nlow density values that are expected from a \"rubble pile\" are derived.

However, because of time, cost, and scoring reliability\nconstraints associated with this format, CR questions are being increasingly\nreplaced by multiple-choice (MC) questions in formal exams. The integrated\ntestlet (IT) is a recently-developed question structure designed to provide a\nproxy of the pedagogical advantages of CR questions while procedurally\nfunctioning as set of MC questions. ITs utilize an answer-until-correct\nresponse format that provides immediate confirmatory or corrective feedback,\nand they thus allow not only for the granting of partial credit in cases of\ninitially incorrect reasoning, but furthermore the ability to build cumulative\nquestion structures. Here, we report on a study that directly compares the\nfunctionality of ITs and CR questions in introductory physics exams. To do\nthis, CR questions were converted to concept-equivalent ITs, and both sets of\nquestions were deployed in midterm and final exams. We find that both question\ntypes provide adequate discrimination between stronger and weaker students,\nwith CR questions discriminating slightly better than the ITs. Meanwhile, an\nanalysis of inter-rater scoring of the CR questions raises serious concerns\nabout the reliability of the granting of partial credit when this traditional\nassessment technique is used in a realistic (but non optimized) setting.\nFurthermore, we show evidence that partial credit is granted in a valid manner\nin the ITs. Thus, together with consideration of the vastly reduced costs of\nadministering IT-based examinations compared to CR-based examinations, our\nfindings indicate that ITs are viable replacements for CR questions in formal\nexaminations where it is desirable to both assess concept integration and to\nreward partial knowledge, while efficiently scoring examinations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 21:03:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 19:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We created a microscopic analytic theory by\nincorporating the structures of selectin and integrin receptors into a\nconceptual framework based on the theory of stochastic equations, which\nquantitatively explains a wide range of experimental data (including\ncatch-bonds at low forces and slip-bonds at high forces). Catch-bonds arise due\nto force-induced remodeling of hydrogen bond networks, a finding that also\naccounts for unbinding in structurally unrelated integrin-fibronectin and\nactomyosin complexes. For the selectin family, remodeling of hydrogen bond\nnetworks drives an allosteric transition resulting in the formation of maximum\nnumber of hydrogen bonds determined only by the structure of the receptor and\nis independent of the ligand. A similar transition allows us to predict the\nincrease in number of hydrogen bonds in a particular allosteric state of\n$\\alpha_5 \\beta_1$ integrin-fibronectin complex, a conformation which is yet to\nbe crystallized.

We then provide a pedagogical introduction to\nthe DGP model, of which the Cascading DGP is an extension, and to the dRGT\nmassive gravity. Concerning the Cascading DGP, we show that the thin limit of\nthe 4D brane inside the (already thin) 5D brane is well defined, at least for\nthe class of configurations that we consider, and confirm that gravity is\nregularized in these set-ups. We give a geometrical interpretation of the\npresence of the critical tension, and comment on the difference between the\nresults in the literature and our results, which we support with a numerical\ncalculation. Regarding the dRGT massive gravity, we focus on the branch of\nsolutions in which the Vainshtein mechanism can occur. We determine\nanalytically the number and properties of local solutions which exist\nasymptotically on large scales (but still below the gravitational Compton\nwavelength), and of local (inner) solutions which exist on small scales. We\ncharacterize exactly the properties of global solutions in every point of the\nphase space, and characterize precisely in which regions the Vainshtein\nmechanism takes place. We also provide numerical solutions which confirm our\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 22:36:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 16:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-18"}

We propose two approaches to estimating the mixing efficiency,\n$\\eta$, or the ratio of the rate of potential energy creation to the total\nrate-of-working on the ocean by microswimmers. The first is based on scaling\narguments and estimates $\\eta$ in terms of the ratio between the typical\norganism size, $a$, and an intrinsic length scale for the stratified flow,\n$\\ell = \\left ( \\nu \\kappa / N^2 \\right )^{1/4}$, where $\\nu$ is the kinematic\nviscosity, $\\kappa$ the diffusivity, and $N$ the buoyancy frequency. In\nparticular, for small organisms in the relevant oceanic limit, $a / \\ell \\ll\n1$, we predict the scaling $\\eta \\sim (a / \\ell)^3$. The second estimate of\n$\\eta$ is formed by solving the full coupled flow-stratification problem by\nmodeling the swimmer as a regularized force dipole, and computing the\nefficiency numerically. Our computational results, which are examined for all\nratios $a/\\ell$, validate the scaling arguments in the limit $a / \\ell \\ll 1$\nand further predict $\\eta \\approx 1.2 \\left ( a / \\ell \\right )^3$ for vertical\nswimming and $\\eta \\approx 0.15 \\left ( a / \\ell \\right )^3$ for horizontal\nswimming.

Given an input string and a grammar, the parsing problem is to check\nif the input string belongs to the language generated by the grammar. A closely\nrelated problem of great importance is one where the input are a string ${\\cal\nI}$ and a grammar $G$ and the task is to produce a string ${\\cal I}'$ that\nbelongs to the language generated by $G$ and the `distance' between ${\\cal I}$\nand ${\\cal I}'$ is the smallest (from among all the strings in the language).\nSpecifically, if ${\\cal I}$ is in the language generated by $G$, then the\noutput should be ${\\cal I}$. Any parser that solves this version of the problem\nis called an {\\em error correcting parser}. In 1972 Aho and Peterson presented\na cubic time error correcting parser for context free grammars. Since then this\nasymptotic time bound has not been improved under the (standard) assumption\nthat the grammar size is a constant. In this paper we present an error\ncorrecting parser for context free grammars that runs in $O(T(n))$ time, where\n$n$ is the length of the input string and $T(n)$ is the time needed to compute\nthe tropical product of two $n\\times n$ matrices.\n  In this paper we also present an $\\frac{n}{M}$-approximation algorithm for\nthe {\\em language edit distance problem} that has a run time of $O(Mn^\\omega)$,\nwhere $O(n^\\omega)$ is the time taken to multiply two $n\\times n$ matrices.

Following the\nwork of Schoenberg [Duke Math. J. 9], Rudin [Duke Math. J. 26], and others, it\nis well-known that functions preserving positivity for matrices of all\ndimensions are absolutely monotonic (i.e., analytic with nonnegative Taylor\ncoefficients). In this paper, we study functions preserving positivity when\napplied entrywise to sparse matrices, with zeros encoded by a graph $G$ or a\nfamily of graphs $G_n$. Our results generalize Schoenberg and Rudin's results\nto a modern setting, where functions are often applied entrywise to sparse\nmatrices in order to improve their properties (e.g. better conditioning). The\nonly such result known in the literature is for the complete graph $K_2$. We\nprovide the first such characterization result for a large family of\nnon-complete graphs. Specifically, we characterize functions preserving Loewner\npositivity on matrices with zeros according to a tree. These functions are\nmultiplicatively midpoint-convex and super-additive. Leveraging the underlying\nsparsity in matrices thus admits the use of functions which are not necessarily\nanalytic nor absolutely monotonic. We further show that analytic functions\npreserving positivity on matrices with zeros according to trees can contain\narbitrarily long sequences of negative coefficients, thus obviating the need\nfor absolute monotonicity in a very strong sense. This result leads to the\nquestion of exactly when absolute monotonicity is necessary when preserving\npositivity for an arbitrary class of graphs. We then provide a stronger\ncondition in terms of the numerical range of all symmetric matrices, such that\nfunctions satisfying this condition on matrices with zeros according to any\nfamily of graphs with unbounded degrees are necessarily absolutely monotonic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 02:37:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 22:25:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 07:29:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

WDM clusters gain significantly more mass via smooth\naccretion and contain fewer substructures than their CDM brethren.

However, these large-scale fields may also be\ncontrolled by tides, as previously suggested for the star $\\tau$-boo, Mars or\nthe Early Moon. By simulating a small local patch of a rotating fluid,\n\\cite{Barker2014} have recently shown that tides can drive small-scale dynamos\nby exciting a hydrodynamic instability, the so-called elliptical (or tidal)\ninstability. By performing global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a rotating\nspherical fluid body, we investigate if this instability can also drive the\nobserved large-scale magnetic fields. We are thus interested by the dynamo\nthreshold and the generated magnetic field in order to test if such a mechanism\nis relevant for planets and stars. Rather than solving the problem in a\ngeometry deformed by tides, we consider a spherical fluid body and add a body\nforce to mimic the tidal deformation in the bulk of the fluid. This allows us\nto use an efficient spectral code to solve the magnetohydrodynamic problem. We\nfirst compare the hydrodynamic results with theoretical asymptotic results, and\nnumerical results obtained in a truely deformed ellipsoid, which confirms the\npresence of the elliptical instability. We then perform magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations, and investigate the dynamo capability of the flow. Kinematic and\nself-consistent dynamos are finally simulated, showing that the elliptical\ninstability is capable of generating dipole dominated large-scale magnetic\nfield in global simulations of a fluid rotating sphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 06:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Rev. Lett. {\\bf 95}, 196801 (2005)] was recently generalized to\nmultiple quenches and arbitrary finite temperatures [Nghiem et al., Phys. Rev.\nB {\\bf 89}, 075118 (2014)] by using the full density matrix approach\n[Weichselbaum et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 99}, 076402 (2007)]. In this paper,\nwe numerically implement this formalism to study the response of a quantum\nimpurity system to a general pulse and periodic driving which are approximated\nby a sufficient number of quenches. We show how the NRG approximation affects\nthe trace of the projected density matrices and the continuity of the\ntime-evolution of a local observable. For the general pulse case, the local\nobservable in the long-time limit exhibits a dependence on the switch-on time,\nthe time interval between the first and last quenches, as well as on the pulse\nshape. In particular, the long-time limit is improved for longer switch-on\ntimes and smoother pulses. This lends support to our earlier suggestion that\nthe long-time limit of observables can be improved by replacing a sudden large\nquench by a sequence of smaller ones acting over a finite time-interval: longer\nswitch-on times and smoother pulses, i.e., increased adiabaticity, favor\nrelaxation of the system to its correct thermodynamic long-time limit. For the\ncase of periodic driving, we compare the TDNRG results to exact analytic ones\nfor the non-interacting resonant level model, finding better agreement at short\nto intermediate time scales in the case of smoother driving. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the validity of the multiple-quench TDNRG formalism for arbitrary\ntemperatures by studying the time-evolution of the occupation number in the\nAnderson impurity model in response to a periodic switching of the local level\nfrom the mixed valence to the Kondo regime at finite temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 07:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 19:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

Quite recently, conspicuously enhanced $B(E2)$s feeding\n$2\\gamma$ states were observed in $^{105}$Nb and conjectured that their parent\nstates are candidates of $3\\gamma$ states. In the present work, the model space\nis enlarged from the present author's previous calculation for $^{103}$Nb.

The particle-vibration coupling model based on the cranking\nmodel and the random-phase approximation is used to calculate the vibrational\nstates in rotating odd-$A$ nuclei. Interband $B(E2)$s are calculated by\nadopting the method of the generalized intensity relation. The present\ncalculation reproduces the observed spectra of $0\\gamma$ - $2\\gamma$ states\nwell and gives collective $3\\gamma$ states with enhanced $B(E2)$s to $2\\gamma$\nstates in $^{103}$Nb and $^{105}$Nb.

The current models also reproduce\nwell the binary orbital properties of the blue stragglers, but fall well short\nof producing the observed number of blue stragglers. This deficit could be\nresolved by reducing the frequency of common-envelope evolution during Roche\nlobe overflow. Both the observations and the $N$-body models strongly indicate\nthat the long-period blue-straggler binaries - which dominate the NGC 188 blue\nstraggler population - are formed by asymptotic-giant (primarily) and red-giant\nmass transfer onto main sequence stars. The models suggest that the few\nnon-velocity-variable blue stragglers formed from mergers or collisions.\nSeveral remarkable short-period double-lined binaries point to the importance\nof subsequent dynamical exchange encounters, and provide at least one example\nof a likely collisional origin for a blue straggler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 09:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Stellar collisions, binary mergers (or coalescence), and partial or\nongoing mass transfer have all been studied in some detail. The products of\nstellar collisions retain memory of their parent stars and are not fully mixed.\nVery high initial rotation rates must be reduced by an unknown process to allow\nthe stars to collapse to the main sequence. The more massive collision products\nhave shorter lifetimes than normal stars of the same mass, while products\nbetween low mass stars are long-lived and look very much like normal stars of\ntheir mass. Mass transfer can result in a merger, or can produce another binary\nsystem with a blue straggler and the remnant of the original primary. The\nproducts of binary mass transfer cover a larger portion of the colour-magnitude\ndiagram than collision products for two reasons: there are more possible\nconfigurations which produce blue stragglers, and there are differing\ncontributions to the blended light of the system. The effects of rotation may\nbe substantial in both collision and merger products, and could result in\nsignificant mixing unless angular momentum is lost shortly after the formation\nevent.

Results of total 25 data\nsets of both non blind and blind targets indicate a good accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 10:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-16"}

Alternatively, the\nFRB should be associated with a GRB afterglow produced by the GRB external\nshock, i.e., an energy-injection-caused shallow-decay afterglow or a normal\nsingle-power-law afterglow if the impulsive energy release of the GRB is high\nenough. In the latter case, the DM contributed by the high-mass GRB ejecta\ncould be substantially important, in particular, for an environment of\nmain-sequence stellar wind. In summary, a careful assessment on the various DM\ncontributors could be required for the cosmological application of the expected\nFRB-GRB association. The future DM measurements of GRB-associated FRBs could\nprovide a constraint on the physics of NS winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 12:37:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 09:21:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 02:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-14"}

As consumers requires sensory experience especially for apparel goods\nfor which their appearance matters most, images play a key role not only in\nconveying crucial information that is hard to express in text, but also in\naffecting consumer's attitude and emotion towards the product. However,\nresearch related to e-commerce product image has mostly focused on quality at\nperceptual level, but not the quality of content, and the way of presenting.\nThis study aims to address the effectiveness of types of image in showcasing\nfashion apparel in terms of its attractiveness, i.e. the ability to draw\nconsumer's attention, interest, and in return their engagement. We apply\nadvanced vision technique to quantize attractiveness using three common display\ntypes in fashion filed, i.e. human model, mannequin, and flat. We perform\ntwo-stage study by starting with large scale behavior data from real online\nmarket, then moving to well designed user experiment to further deepen our\nunderstandings on consumer's reasoning logic behind the action.

Further, we investigate the\npotentials to leverage visual impact for a better search that caters to user's\npreference. A visual attractiveness based re-ranking model that incorporates\nboth presentation efficacy and user preference is proposed. We show\nquantitative improvement by promoting visual attractiveness into search on top\nof relevance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 15:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-16"}

On these lines something very interesting is uncovered in\nIndia, where traditionally there have been monolingual Hindi speakers and\nHindi/English bilinguals, but virtually no monolingual English speakers. While\nthe Indian census data reports a sharp increase in the proportion of\nHindi/English bilinguals, we argue that the number of Hindi/English bilinguals\nin India is inaccurate, given a new class of urban individuals speaking a mixed\nlect of Hindi and English, popularly known as \"Hinglish\".

To validate our model, sociolinguistic data from\ndifferent Indian classes are contrasted with census reports: We see that\npurported urban Hindi/English bilinguals are unable to maintain fluent Hindi\nspeech and instead produce Hinglish, whereas rural speakers evidence\nmonolingual Hindi. Thus we present evidence for the first time where an\nunrecognized mixed lect involving English but not \"English\", has possibly taken\nover a sizeable faction of a large global population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 21:20:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2015 20:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-12"}

Thus we take Einstein-massless-scalar $\\psi$ tensor gravity\nmodel described on class of spherically symmetric curved space times. We\nrewrite the action functional in 2d analogue in terms of dimensionless\ndilaton-matter field $(\\chi=\\Phi\\psi)$ where dilaton field $\\Phi$ is conformal\nfactor of 2-sphere. Then we seek renormalized expectation value of quantum\ndilaton-matter field stress tensor operator by applying Hadamard\nrennormalization prescription. Singularity of the Green function is assumed to\nbe has logarithmic form. Covariantly conservation condition on the renormalized\nquantum dilaton-matter stress tensor demands to input a variable cosmological\nparameter $\\lambda(x)$. Energy conditions (weak, strong and null) is studied on\nthe obtained renormalized stress tensor leading to dynamical equations for\n$\\lambda(x), \\Phi$ and quantum vacuum state $W_0(x)=<0|\\hat{\\chi}^2|0>_{ren}.$\nIn weak quantum field limits our obtained trace anomaly corresponds to one\nwhich obtained from zeta function regularization method.
