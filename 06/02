However, since over a decade now,\nvariations of it are also routinely being implemented with ultracold atoms in\noptical lattices. We review some of the rich literature on this subject, with a\nfocus on more recent non-standard forms of the Hubbard model. After an\nintroduction to standard (fermionic and bosonic) Hubbard models, we discuss\nbriefly common models for mixtures, as well as the so called extended\nBose-Hubbard models, that include interactions between neighboring sites,\nnext-neighboring sites, and so on. The main part of the review discusses the\nimportance of additional terms appearing when refining the tight-binding\napproximation on the original physical Hamiltonian. Even when restricting the\nmodels to the lowest Bloch band is justified, the standard approach neglects\nthe density-induced tunneling (which has the same origin as the usual on-site\ninteraction). The importance of these contributions is discussed for both\ncontact and dipolar interactions. For sufficiently strong interactions, also\nthe effects related to higher Bloch bands become important even for deep\noptical lattices. Different approaches that aim at incorporating these effects,\nmainly via dressing the basis Wannier functions with interactions, leading to\neffective, density-dependent Hubbard-type models, are reviewed. We discuss also\nexamples of Hubbard-like models that explicitly involve higher $p$-orbitals, as\nwell as models that couple dynamically spin and orbital degrees of freedom.\nFinally, we review mean-field nonlinear-Schr\\\"odinger models of the Salerno\ntype that share with the non-standard Hubbard models the nonlinear coupling\nbetween the adjacent sites. In that part, discrete solitons are the main\nsubject of the consideration.

These are largely drawn from the recent PAndAS\nglobular cluster catalogue; 63 of our targets have no previous velocity data.\nVia a Bayesian maximum likelihood analysis we find that GCs with Rproj > 30 kpc\nexhibit coherent rotation around the minor optical axis of M31, in the same\ndirection as more centrally- located GCs, but with a smaller amplitude of\n86+/-17 km s-1. There is also evidence that the velocity dispersion of the\nouter halo GC system decreases as a function of projected distance from the M31\ncentre, and that this relation can be well described by a power law of index ~\n-0.5. The velocity dispersion profile of the outer halo GCs is quite similar to\nthat of the halo stars, at least out to the radius up to which there is\navailable information on the stellar kinematics. We detect and discuss various\nvelocity correlations amongst subgroups of GCs that lie on stellar debris\nstreams in the M31 halo.

For maximum parsimony, applied to a sequence of random\n2-state data, each possible binary phylogenetic tree has exactly the same\ndistribution for its parsimony score. Despite this pleasing and slightly\nsurprising symmetry, some binary phylogenetic trees are more likely than others\nto be a most parsimonious (MP) tree for a sequence of $k$ such characters, as\nwe show. For $k=2$, and unrooted binary trees on six taxa, any tree with a\ncaterpillar shape has a higher chance of being an MP tree than any tree with a\nsymmetric shape. On the other hand, if we take any two binary trees, on any\nnumber of taxa, we prove that this bias between the two trees vanishes as the\nnumber of characters grows.

The essential idea is that an anyon of a topological\nphase can be endowed with fractional quantum numbers when the string attached\nto it slides over a background pattern of flux in the ground state. The string\nflux models that illustrate this mechanism are $Z_n$ quantum double models\ndefined on specially constructed $d$-dimensional lattices, and possess $Z_n$\ntopological order for $d \\geq 2$. The models have a unitary, internal symmetry\n$G$, where $G$ is an arbitrary finite group. The simplest string flux model is\na $Z_2$ toric code defined on a bilayer square lattice, where $G = Z_2$ is\nlayer-exchange symmetry. In general, by varying the pattern of $Z_n$ flux in\nthe ground state, any desired fractionalization class [element of $H^2(G,\nZ_n)$] can be realized for the $Z_n$ charge excitations. While the string flux\nmodels are not gauge theories, they map to $Z_n$ gauge theories in a certain\nlimit, where they follow a novel magnetic route for the emergence of low-energy\ngauge structure. The models are analyzed by studying the action of $G$ symmetry\non $Z_n$ charge excitations, and by gauging the $G$ symmetry. The latter\nanalysis confirms that distinct fractionalization classes give rise to distinct\nquantum phases, except that classes $[\\omega], [\\omega]^{-1} \\in H^2(G, Z_n)$\ngive rise to the same phase.

The lattice rule is\nrandomized using independent random shifts in each coordinate direction that\nare uniformly distributed in the interval [0,1]. This randomized lattice rule\nresults in an unbiased estimator of the multiple integral. However, in\npractice, random variables that are independent and uniformly distributed on\n[0,1] are not available, since this would require an infinite number of random\nindependent bits. A more realistic practical implementation of the Cranley and\nPatterson randomization uses rs independent random bits, in the following way.\nThe lattice rule is randomized using independent random shifts in each\ncoordinate direction that are uniformly distributed on {0, 1/2^r, ...\n,(2^r-1)/2^r}, where r may be large. For a rank-1 lattice rule with 2^m\nquadrature points and r >= m, we show that this randomized lattice rule leads\nto an estimator of the multiple integral that typically has a large bias.

An important hallmark of topological superconductors is the\nexistence of protected zero-energy states at surfaces or in vortex cores. Here\nwe investigate Majorana vortex-bound states in three-dimensional nodal and\nfully gapped NCSs by combining analytical solutions of Bogoliubov-de Gennes\n(BdG) equations in the continuum with exact diagonalization of BdG\nHamiltonians. We show that depending on the crystal point-group symmetries and\nthe topological properties of the bulk Bogoliubov-quasiparticle wave functions,\ndifferent types of zero-energy Majorana modes can appear inside the vortex\ncore. We find that for nodal NCSs with tetragonal point group $C_{4v}$ the\nvortex states are dispersionless along the vortex line, forming one-dimensional\nMajorana flat bands, while for NCSs with $D_{4}$ point-group symmetry the\nvortex modes are helical Majorana states with a linear dispersion along the\nvortex line. NCSs with monoclinic point group $C_2$, on the other hand, do not\nexhibit any zero-energy vortex-bound states.

This enhancement grows as the\ntransparency window width, \\Delta_EIT, is narrowed. Decreasing \\Delta_EIT,\nhowever, increases the response time of the effect, suggesting that for pulses\nof a given duration, there could be a fundamental limit to the strength of the\nnonlinearity. We show that in the regimes of most practical interest - narrow\nEIT windows perturbed by short signal pulses- the enhancement offered by EIT is\nnot only in the magnitude of the nonlinear phase shift but in fact also in its\nincreased duration. That is, for the case of signal pulses much shorter\n(temporally) than the inverse EIT bandwidth, the narrow window serves to\nprolong the effect of the passing signal pulse, leading to an integrated phase\nshift that grows linearly with \\Delta_EIT even though the peak phase shift may\nsaturate; the continued growth of the integrated phase shift improves the\ndetectability of the phase shift, in principle without bound. For many\npurposes, it is this detectability which is of interest, more than the absolute\nmagnitude of the peak phase shift. We present analytical expressions based on a\nlinear time-invariant model that accounts for the temporal behavior of the\ncross-phase modulation for several parameter ranges of interest.

In these systems, the\npolar discontinuity across the interface may drive an electronic reconstruction\ninducing free carriers at the interface. Here, we theoretically show that a\nmetallic interface between a Mott- and a band-insulator can also form in the\nabsence of a polar discontinuity. The condition for the appearance of such a\nmetallic state is consistent with the classical Mott criterion: the metallic\nstate is stable if the screening length falls below the effective Bohr radius\nof a particle-hole pair. In this case, the metallic state bears a remarkable\nsimilarity to the one found in polar/nonpolar heterostructures. On the other\nhand, if the screening length approaches the size of the effective Bohr radius,\nparticles and holes are bound to each other resulting in an overall insulating\nphase. We analyze this metal-insulator transition, which is tunable by the\ndielectric constant, in the framework of the slave-boson mean-field theory for\na lattice model with both onsite and long-range Coulomb interactions. We\ndiscuss ground-state properties and transport coefficients, which we derive in\nthe relaxation-time approximation.

Aims. Here we report the first\nevidence for a glory in the disk-integrated photometry of Venus and, in turn,\nof any planet. Methods. We used previously published phase curves of the planet\nthat were reproduced over the full range of phase angles with model predictions\nbased on a realistic description of the Venus atmosphere. We assumed that the\noptical properties of the planet as a whole can be described by a uniform and\nstable cloud cover, an assumption that agrees well with observational evidence.\nResults. We specifically show that the measured phase curves mimic the\nscattering properties of the Venus upper-cloud micron-sized aerosols, also at\nthe small phase angles at which the glory occurs, and that the glory contrast\nis consistent with what is expected after multiple scattering of photons. In\nthe optical, the planet appears to be brighter at phase angles of 11-13 deg\nthan at full illumination; it undergoes a maximum dimming of up to 10 percent\nat phases in between. Conclusions.

When\ndiscussing such a more general supermarket model, this paper makes some new\nresults and advances as follows: (1) Providing a detailed probability analysis\nfor setting up an infinite-dimensional system of differential vector equations\nsatisfied by the expected fraction vector, where \"the invariance of environment\nfactors\" is given as an important result. (2) Introducing the phase-type\nstructure to the operator semigroup and to the mean-field limit, and a\nLipschitz condition can be obtained by means of a unified matrix-differential\nalgorithm. (3) The matrix-analytic method is used to compute the fixed point\nwhich leads to performance computation of this system. Finally, we use some\nnumerical examples to illustrate how the performance measures of this\nsupermarket model depend on the non-Poisson inputs and on the non-exponential\nservice times.

M63 is a remarkable example of a spiral galaxy with one of the\nmost extended UV disks, so it offers the opportunity to search for the\nmolecular gas and characterize the star formation in outer disk regions as\nrevealed by the UV emission. We obtained deep CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) observations\non the IRAM 30 m telescope along the major axis of the M63 disk from the center\nout to the galactocentric radius rgal = 1.6 r25 and over a bright UV region at\nrgal = 1.36 r25. CO(1-0) is detected all along the M63 major axis out to r25,\nand CO(2-1) is confined to rgal = 0.68 r25, which may betray lower excitation\ntemperatures in the outer disk. CO(1-0) is also detected in the external bright\nUV region of M63. The radial profiles of the CO emission and of the Halpha, 24\nmicron, NUV and FUV star formation tracers and HI taken from the literature\nshow a severe drop with the galactocentric radius, such that beyond r25 they\nare all absent with the exception of a faint UV emission and HI. The CO\nemission detection in the external UV region, where the UV flux is higher than\nthe UV flux observed beyond r25, highlights a tight correlation between the CO\nand UV fluxes, namely the amount of molecular gas and the intensity of star\nformation. This external UV region is dominated by the atomic gas, suggesting\nthat HI is more likely the precursor of H2 rather than the product of UV\nphotodissociation. A broken power law needs to be invoked to describe the\nKennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) relation of M63 from the center of the galaxy out to\nrgal = 1.36 r25. While all along the major axis out to r25 the K-S relation is\nalmost linear, in the external UV region the SFR regime is highly nonlinear and\ncharacterized by a steep K-S relation and very low star formation efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2014 09:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

By\nanalysing 246 X-ray bursts observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer from 11\nlow-mass X-ray binaries, we find a dependence between the persistent spectral\nproperties and the time evolution of the black body normalisation during the\nbursts. All NS atmosphere models predict that the colour-correction factor\ndecreases in the early cooling phase when the luminosity first drops below the\nlimiting Eddington value, leading to a characteristic pattern of variability in\nthe measured blackbody normalisation. However, the model predictions agree with\nthe observations for most bursts occurring in hard, low-luminosity, 'island'\nspectral states, but rarely during soft, high-luminosity, 'banana' states. The\nobserved behaviour may be attributed to the accretion flow, which influences\ncooling of the NS preferentially during the soft state bursts. This result\nimplies that only the bursts occurring in the hard, low-luminosity spectral\nstates can be reliably used for NS mass and radius determination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2014 10:49:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 14:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-18"}

Comparable\nmagnitudes implies strong temporal modulation, as the forcing frequencies are\nnearly but not precisely equal. We suggest that on the basis of paleogeographic\nreconstructions, in the Devonian period, when the first tetrapods appeared on\nland, a large tidal range would accompany these modulated tides. This would\nhave been conducive to the formation of a network of isolated tidal pools,\nlending support to A.S.

Since even a modest\ndifference in the Moon's angular size relative to the Sun's would lead to a\nqualitatively different tidal modulation, the fact that we live on a planet\nwith a Sun and Moon of close apparent size is not entirely coincidental: it may\nhave an anthropic basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2014 10:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

As a consequence, they have been successfully employed\nin discrete algorithms to solve purely theoretical problems in a broad variety\nof mathematical research areas (knot theory, polytope theory, 2- and 3-manifold\ntopology, geometry, and others).

Here, we present a\ncomprehensive investigation assessing the relative impact of metals and\nmagnetic fields, which may both be present during low-metallicity star\nformation. We show that the presence of magnetic fields generated via the\nsmall-scale dynamo stabilises the protostellar disc and provides some degree of\nsupport against fragmentation. In the absence of magnetic fields, the\nfragmentation timescale in our model decreases by a factor of ~10 at the\ntransition from Z=0 to Z>0, with subsequently only a weak dependence on\nmetallicity. Similarly, the accretion timescale of the cluster is set by the\nlarge-scale dynamics rather than the local thermodynamics. In the presence of\nmagnetic fields, the primordial disc can become completely stable, therefore\nforming only one central fragment. At Z>0, the number of fragments is somewhat\nreduced in the presence of magnetic fields, though the shape of the mass\nspectrum is not strongly affected in the limits of the statistical\nuncertainties. The fragmentation timescale, however, increases by roughly a\nfactor of 3 in the presence of magnetic fields. Indeed, our results indicate\ncomparable fragmentation timescales in primordial runs without magnetic fields\nand Z>0 runs with magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2014 12:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

The supermassive black hole, Sagittarius (Sgr) A*, in the centre of\nour Galaxy has the largest angular size in the sky among all astrophysical\nblack holes. Its shadow, assuming no rotation, spans ~ 50 microarcsec.\nResolving such dimensions has long been out of reach for astronomical\ninstruments until a new generation of interferometers being operational during\nthis decade. Of particular interest is the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) with\nresolution ~ 20 microarcsec in the millimeter-wavelength range 0.87 mm - 1.3\nmm. Aims. We investigate the ability of the fully general relativistic\nKomissarov (2006) analytical magnetized torus model to account for observable\nconstraints at Sgr A* in the centimeter and millimeter domains. The impact of\nthe magnetic field geometry on the observables is also studied. Methods. We\ncalculate ray-traced centimeter- and millimeter-wavelength synchrotron spectra\nand images of a magnetized accretion torus surrounding the central black hole\nin Sgr A*. We assume stationarity, axial symmetry, constant specific angular\nmomentum and polytropic equation of state. A hybrid population of thermal and\nnon-thermal electrons is considered. Results. We show that the torus model is\ncapable of reproducing spectral constraints in the millimeter domain, and in\nparticular in the observable domain of the EHT. However, the torus model is not\nyet able to fit the centimeter spectrum. 1.3 mm images at high inclinations are\nin agreement with observable constraints. Conclusions. The ability of the torus\nmodel to account for observations of Sgr A* in the millimeter domain is\ninteresting in the perspective of the future EHT. Such an analytical model\nallows very fast computations. It will thus be a suitable test bed for\ninvestigating large domains of physical parameters, as well as non-black-hole\ncompact object candidates and alternative theories of gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2014 13:15:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 11:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The class of problems addressed corresponds to\nordinary differential equations (ODEs) with generalized linear constraints,\nwhereby the data from an array of sensors forms the forcing function. The\nsolution of the equation is formulated as a least squares (LS) problem with\nlinear constraints. The LS approach makes the method suitable for the explicit\nsolution of inverse problems where the forcing function is perturbed by noise.\nThe algebraic computation is partitioned into a initial preparatory step, which\nprecomputes the matrices required for the run-time computation; and the cyclic\nrun-time computation, which is repeated with each acquisition of sensor data.\nThe cyclic computation consists of a single matrix-vector multiplication, in\nthis manner computation complexity is known a-priori, fulfilling the definition\nof a real-time computation. Numerical testing of the new method is presented on\nperturbed as well as unperturbed problems; the results are compared with known\nanalytic solutions and solutions acquired from state-of-the-art implicit\nsolvers. The solution is implemented with model based design and uses only\nfundamental linear algebra; consequently, this approach supports automatic code\ngeneration for deployment on embedded systems. The targeting concept was tested\nvia software- and processor-in-the-loop verification on two systems with\ndifferent processor architectures. Finally, the method was tested on a\nlaboratory prototype with real measurement data for the monitoring of flexible\nstructures. The problem solved is: the real-time overconstrained reconstruction\nof a curve from measured gradients. Such systems are commonly encountered in\nthe monitoring of structures and/or ground subsidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2014 14:18:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-03"}

Most use the Loss Distribution\nApproach (LDA) which defines the aggregate loss distribution as the convolution\nof a frequency and a severity distribution representing the number and\nmagnitude of losses, respectively. Estimated capital is a Value-at-Risk (99.9th\npercentile) estimate of this annual loss distribution. In practice, the\nseverity distribution drives the capital estimate, which is essentially a very\nhigh quantile of the estimated severity distribution. Unfortunately, because\nthe relevant severities are heavy-tailed AND the quantiles being estimated are\nso high, VaR always appears to be a convex function of the severity parameters,\ncausing all widely-used estimators to generate biased capital estimates\n(apparently) due to Jensen's Inequality. The observed capital inflation is\nsometimes enormous, even at the unit-of-measure (UoM) level (even billions\nUSD). Herein I present an estimator of capital that essentially eliminates this\nupward bias. The Reduced-bias Capital Estimator (RCE) is more consistent with\nthe regulatory intent of the LDA framework than implementations that fail to\nmitigate this bias. RCE also notably increases the precision of the capital\nestimate and consistently increases its robustness to violations of the i.i.d.\ndata presumption (which are endemic to operational risk loss event data). So\nwith greater capital accuracy, precision, and robustness, RCE lowers capital\nrequirements at both the UoM and enterprise levels, increases capital stability\nfrom quarter to quarter, ceteris paribus, and does both while more accurately\nand precisely reflecting regulatory intent. RCE is straightforward to implement\nusing any major statistical software package.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2014 14:45:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jun 2014 18:44:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 Jul 2014 17:29:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 26 Oct 2014 21:17:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 16 Nov 2014 21:30:17 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 13:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-01"}

Among\ninsects, an increasingly common approach to collecting this class of data\ninvolves transcriptome sequencing, because few insects have high-quality genome\nsequences available; assembling new genomes remains a limiting factor; the\ntranscribed portion of the genome is a reasonable, reduced subset of the genome\nto target; and the data collected from transcribed portions of the genome are\nsimilar in composition to the types of data with which biologists have\ntraditionally worked (e.g., exons). However, molecular techniques requiring RNA\nas a template are limited to using very high quality source materials, which\nare often unavailable from a large proportion of biologically important insect\nsamples. Recent research suggests that DNA-based target enrichment of conserved\ngenomic elements offers another path to collecting phylogenomic data across\ninsect taxa, provided that conserved elements are present in and can be\ncollected from insect genomes. Here, we identify a large set (n$=$1510) of\nultraconserved elements (UCE) shared among the insect order Hymenoptera.

An extreme form of altruism can be found in colicinogenic E. coli.\nThese suicidal altruists explode, releasing colicins that kill unrelated\nindividuals, which are not colicin resistant. By committing suicide, the\naltruist makes it more likely that its kin will have less competition. The\nbenefits of this strategy rely on the number of competitors and kin nearby. If\nthe organism explodes at an inopportune time, the suicidal act may not harm any\ncompetitors. Communication could enable organisms to act altruistically when\nenvironmental conditions suggest that that strategy would be most beneficial.\nQuorum sensing is a form of communication in which bacteria produce a protein\nand gauge the amount of that protein around them.

To address these challenges, we use digital evolution (a form of\nexperimental evolution that uses self-replicating computer programs as\norganisms) to investigate the effects of enabling altruistic organisms to\ncommunicate via quorum sensing. We found that quorum-sensing altruists killed a\ngreater number of competitors per explosion, winning competitions against\nnon-communicative altruists.

In all cases the wake angle is found to follow a Mach-like\nlaw at large velocity, $\\alpha \\sim U^{-1}$, but with different prefactors\ndepending on the value of $\\mathrm{Bo}_D$. For small $\\mathrm{Bo}_D$ (large\ncapillary effects), the wake angle approximately follows the law $\\alpha \\simeq\nc_{\\rm g,min} / U$, where $c_{\\rm g,min}$ is the minimum group velocity of\ncapillary-gravity waves. For larger $\\mathrm{Bo}_D$ (weak capillary effects),\nwe recover a law $\\alpha \\sim \\sqrt{gD}/U$ similar to that found for ship wakes\nat large velocity [Rabaud and Moisy, Phys. Rev.

Using the general property of dispersive waves that the characteristic\nwavelength of the wavepacket emitted by a disturbance is of order of the\ndisturbance size, we propose a simple model that describes the transition\nbetween these two Mach-like regimes as the Bond number is varied. We show that\nthe new capillary law $\\alpha \\simeq c_{\\rm g,min} / U$ originates from the\npresence of a capillary cusp angle (distinct from the usual gravity cusp\nangle), along which the energy radiated by the disturbance accumulates for Bond\nnumbers of order of unity. This model, complemented by numerical simulations of\nthe surface elevation induced by a moving Gaussian pressure disturbance, is in\nqualitative agreement with experimental measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jun 2014 15:53:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 18:32:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We have proved three of the\ntheorems from Maskin's 2004 survey article on Auction Theory using the\nIsabelle/HOL system, and we have produced verified code for combinatorial\nVickrey auctions. A fundamental question in this was how to represent some\nbasic concepts: since set theory is available inside Isabelle/HOL, when\nintroducing new definitions there is often the issue of balancing the amount of\nset-theoretical objects and of objects expressed using entities which are more\ntypical of higher order logic such as functions or lists.
