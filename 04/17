It is hence\nreasonable to expect that most core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) take place in\nbinaries and the existence of a companion star may leave some imprints in\nobserved features. Having this in mind, we have conducted two-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations of the collisions of CCSNe ejecta with the companion\nstar in an almost-equal-mass ($\\sim 10M_\\odot$) binary to find out possible\nconsequences of such events. In particular we pay attention to the amount of\nmass removed and its dependence on the binary separation. In contrast to the\nprevious surmise, we find that the companion mass is stripped not by momentum\ntransfer but by shock heating. Up to $25\\%$ of the original mass can be removed\nfor the closest separations and the removed mass decreases as $M_{ub} \\propto\na^{-4.3}$ with the binary separation $a$. By performing some experimental\ncomputations with artificially-modified densities of incident ejecta, we show\nthat if the velocity of ejecta is fixed, the density of incident ejecta is the\nsingle important parameter that actually determines the removed mass as $M_{ub}\n\\propto \\rho_{ej} ^{1.4} $. On the other hand, another set of simulations with\nmodified velocities of incident ejecta demonstrate that the strength of the\nforward shock, which heats up the stellar material and causes the mass loss of\nthe companion star, is actually the key parameter for the removed mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2014 16:05:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2014 14:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We\nfind that the standard coarse-grained approach over-estimates diffusion effects\nby anywhere from a factor of 5 to 50 compared to experimental conditions using\ndsDNA.

A set of $n$ processors is connected into a $d$-regular\nundirected network. In every time step, each processor exchanges some of its\ntokens with each of its neighbors in the network. The goal is to minimize the\ndiscrepancy between the number of tokens on the most-loaded and the\nleast-loaded processor as quickly as possible.\n  Rabani et al. (1998) present a general technique for the analysis of a wide\nclass of discrete load balancing algorithms. Their approach is to characterize\nthe deviation between the actual loads of a discrete balancing algorithm with\nthe distribution generated by a related Markov chain. The Markov chain can also\nbe regarded as the underlying model of a continuous diffusion algorithm. Rabani\net al. showed that after time $T = O(\\log (Kn)/\\mu)$, any algorithm of their\nclass achieves a discrepancy of $O(d\\log n/\\mu)$, where $\\mu$ is the spectral\ngap of the transition matrix of the graph, and $K$ is the initial load\ndiscrepancy in the system.\n  In this work we identify some natural additional conditions on deterministic\nbalancing algorithms, resulting in a class of algorithms reaching a smaller\ndiscrepancy. This class contains well-known algorithms, eg., the Rotor-Router.\nSpecifically, we introduce the notion of cumulatively fair load-balancing\nalgorithms where in any interval of consecutive time steps, the total number of\ntokens sent out over an edge by a node is the same (up to constants) for all\nadjacent edges. We prove that algorithms which are cumulatively fair and where\nevery node retains a sufficient part of its load in each step, achieve a\ndiscrepancy of $O(\\min\\{d\\sqrt{\\log n/\\mu},d\\sqrt{n}\\})$ in time $O(T)$. We\nalso show that in general neither of these assumptions may be omitted without\nincreasing discrepancy. We then show by a combinatorial potential reduction\nargument that any cumulatively fair scheme satisfying some additional\nassumptions achieves a discrepancy of $O(d)$ almost as quickly as the\ncontinuous diffusion process. This positive result applies to some of the\nsimplest and most natural discrete load balancing schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2014 18:50:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 15:30:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2014 17:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 2015 08:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-24"}

Therefore, we\nhave developed arc-evaporated Ti1-x-yAlxTayN coatings with various Al (x = 0.50\n- 0.65) and Ta (y = 0.00 - 0.15) contents. While the thermal stability of our\ncoatings during annealing in inert He atmosphere increases with increasing Ta\ncontent, best results are obtained for specific Ta-Al ratios during oxidation.\nSingle phase cubic Ti0.32Al0.60Ta0.08N yields a mass-gain of only ~5 % after 5\nh at 950 {\\deg}C in synthetic air, whereas Ti0.35Al0.65N is completely oxidized\nafter 15 min. This is in part based on the suppressed anatase and direct rutile\nTiO2 formation at a defined Ta-Al content. Consequently, the anatase-to-rutile\ntransformation, generally observed for Ti1-xAlxN, is absent. This reduces the\ngeneration of pores and cracks within the oxide scale and especially at the\nnitride-oxide interface, leading to the formation of a protective rutile and\ncorundum based oxide scale. This is also reflected in the pronounced decrease\nin activation energy for the protective scale formation from 232 kJ/mol for\nTi0.35Al0.65N down to 14.5 kJ/mol for Ti0.32Al0.60Ta0.08N.

By\napplying a previously determined nuclear density of $^{48}$Ca, the neutron\ndensities of the zirconium isotopes are adjusted to optimize the fit to the\nfusion data, whereas the proton densities are determined by electron scattering\nexperiments. It is shown that the fusion data can be explained fairly well by\nincluding couplings to one- and two-phonon excitations of the reacting nuclei\nand to one- and two-nucleon transfer reactions but there is also some\nsensitivity to multiphonon excitations. The neutron skin thicknesses extracted\nfor the two zirconium isotopes are consistent with anti-proton measurements.\nThe densities of the zirconium isotopes are used together with the previously\ndetermined nuclear density of $^{40}$Ca to calculate the M3Y+repulsion\npotentials and predict the fusion cross sections of $^{40}$Ca+$^{90,96}$Zr.

However, they do span\na mass range with quite different AM distributions imparted during formation,\nwith the stars less massive than ~1.6 M_Sun arriving on the main sequence with\nlower rotation rates than the more massive stars.

These foregrounds come from a variety of sources (such as\nGalactic synchrotron emission and extragalactic point sources), but almost all\nshare the property of being spectrally smooth, and when viewed through the\nchromatic response of an interferometer, occupy a signature \"wedge\" region in\ncylindrical $k_\\perp k_\\parallel$ Fourier space. The complement of the\nforeground wedge is termed the \"EoR window\", and is expected to be mostly\nforeground-free, allowing clean measurements of the power spectrum. This paper\nis a sequel to a previous paper that established a rigorous mathematical\nframework for describing the foreground wedge and the EoR window. Here, we use\nour framework to explore statistical methods by which the EoR window can be\nenlarged, thereby increasing the sensitivity of a power spectrum measurement.\nWe adapt the FKP approximation (commonly used in galaxy surveys) for 21 cm\ncosmology, and also compare the optimal quadratic estimator to simpler\nestimators that ignore covariances between different Fourier modes. The optimal\nquadratic estimator is found to suppress foregrounds by an extra factor of\n$\\sim 10^5$ in power at the peripheries of the EoR window, boosting the\ndetection of the cosmological signal from $12\\sigma$ to $50\\sigma$ at the\nmidpoint of reionization in our fiducial models. If numerical issues can be\nfinessed, decorrelation techniques allow the EoR window to be further enlarged,\nenabling measurements to be made deep within the foreground wedge. These\ntechniques do not assume that foreground are Gaussian-distributed, and we\nadditionally prove that a final round of foreground subtraction can be\nperformed after decorrelation in a way that is guaranteed to have no\ncosmological signal loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2014 20:07:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 11:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-25"}

However, they totally vanish for theta > 5.5o (D < 2.5 nm).\nSuch a behavior indicates that the continuum models, which capture\nmoir\\'e-pattern periodicity more accurately at small rotation angles, are no\nlonger applicable at large rotation angles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 01:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-09"}

Here, the\nproblem of nonparametrically estimating a copula density is addressed. Arguably\nthe most popular nonparametric density estimator, the kernel estimator is not\nsuitable for the unit-square-supported copula densities, mainly because it is\nheavily affected by boundary bias issues. In addition, most common copulas\nadmit unbounded densities, and kernel methods are not consistent in that case.\nIn this paper, a kernel-type copula density estimator is proposed. It is based\non the idea of transforming the uniform marginals of the copula density into\nnormal distributions via the probit function, estimating the density in the\ntransformed domain, which can be accomplished without boundary problems, and\nobtaining an estimate of the copula density through back-transformation.\nAlthough natural, a raw application of this procedure was, however, seen not to\nperform very well in the earlier literature. Here, it is shown that, if\ncombined with local likelihood density estimation methods, the idea yields very\ngood and easy to implement estimators, fixing boundary issues in a natural way\nand able to cope with unbounded copula densities. The asymptotic properties of\nthe suggested estimators are derived, and a practical way of selecting the\ncrucially important smoothing parameters is devised. Finally, extensive\nsimulation studies and a real data analysis evidence their excellent\nperformance compared to their main competitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 02:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-18"}

It is therefore concluded that the nuclear spins diffuse\nfrom the polarization QW to the detection QW. The time evolution of the\nlongitudinal resistance of the polarization QW is explained mainly by the\nnuclear-spin diffusion in the in-plane direction. In contrast, that of the\ndetection QW manifests much slower nuclear diffusion in the perpendicular\ndirection through the AlGaAs barrier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 05:25:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 07:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

The existing study of symmetric dark matter in a GB braneworld\n(Okada and Okada, 2009) found that the expansion rate was reduced compared to\nthat in standard General Relativity (GR), thereby delaying particle freeze-out\nand resulting in relic abundances which are suppressed by up to\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$. This is in direct contrast to the behaviour observed in\nRS braneworlds where the expansion rate is enhanced and the final relic\nabundance boosted. However, this finding that relic abundances are suppressed\nin a GB braneworld is based upon a highly contrived situation in which the GB\nera evolves directly into a standard GR era, rather than passing through a RS\nera as is the general situation. This collapse of the RS era requires equating\nthe mass scale $m_{\\alpha}$ of the GB modification and the mass scale\n$m_{\\sigma}$ of the brane tension. However, if the GB contribution is to be\nconsidered as the lowest order correction from string theory to the RS action,\nwe would expect $m_{\\alpha} > m_{\\sigma}$.

The method is based on a simple mathematical model of a super-hot\n(T ~ 1E8 K) turbulent-current layer (SHTCL) and a model of plasma heating by\nthe layer.

However, in contrast to a conventional\nwireless communication system, distance bounding systems introduce tight\nrequirements on the processing delay at the prover and require high distance\nmeasurement precision making their practical realization challenging. Prior\nproposals of distance bounding systems focused primarily on building provers\nwith minimal processing delays but did not consider the power limitations of\nprovers and verifiers. However, in a wide range of applications (e.g., physical\naccess control), provers are expected to be fully or semi-passive introducing\nadditional constraints on the design and implementation of distance bounding\nsystems.\n  In this work, we propose a new physical layer scheme for distance bounding\nand leverage this scheme to implement a distance bounding system with a\nlow-power prover. Our physical layer combines frequency modulated continuous\nwave (FMCW) and backscatter communication. The use of backscatter communication\nenables low power consumption at the prover which is critical for a number of\ndistance bounding applications. By using the FMCW-based physical layer, we\nfurther decouple the physical distance estimation from the processing delay at\nthe prover, thereby enabling the realization of the majority of distance\nbounding protocols developed in prior art. We evaluate our system under various\nattack scenarios and show that it offers strong security guarantees against\ndistance, mafia and terrorist frauds.

For such a scenario, we present a two stage\nreceiver to enhance signal detection from the satellite of interest, i.e., the\nsatellite that the dish is pointing to, while reducing interference from\nneighboring satellites. Towards this objective, we propose an enhanced\nList-based Group-wise Search Detection (LGSD) receiver architecture that takes\ninto account the spatially correlated additive noise and uses the\nsignal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR) maximization criterion to\nimprove detection performance.

Close binary systems composed of an\nsdB star and a compact object (white dwarf, neutron star or black hole) could\nbe detected as accretion-powered X-ray sources. The study of their X-ray\nemission can probe the properties of line-driven winds of sdB stars that can\nnot be derived directly from spectroscopy because of the low luminosity of\nthese stars. Here we report on the first sensitive X-ray observations of two\nsdB binaries with compact companions. CD -30 11223 is the sdB binary with the\nshortest known orbital period (1.2 h) and its companion is certainly a white\ndwarf.

But\nhabitability of inner rocky planets may be supported in those planetary systems\nhosting giant planets.\n  Gravitational interactions within a complex multiple-body structure including\ngiant planets may supply terrestrial planets with materials which formed in the\ncolder region of the proto-planetary disk. During these processes, water, the\nprime requisite for habitability, is delivered to the inner system. This may\noccur either during the main accretion phase of terrestrial planets or via\nimpacts during a post-accretion bombardment. Results for both processes are\nsummarized and discussed with reference to the lunar crater record.\n  Starting from a scenario involving migration of the giant planets this\ncontribution discusses the delivery of water to Earth, the modification of\natmospheres by impacts in a planetary system context and the likelihood of the\nexistence of extrasolar Earth-like habitable worlds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 09:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-18"}

It has long been observed that known bin packing algorithms with\noptimal average-case performance were not optimal in the worst-case sense. In\nparticular First Fit and Best Fit had optimal average-case ratio of 1 but a\nworst-case competitive ratio of 1.7. The wasted space of First Fit and Best Fit\nfor a uniform random sequence of length $n$ is expected to be $\\Theta(n^{2/3})$\nand $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n} \\log ^{3/4} n)$, respectively. The competitive ratio can\nbe improved to 1.691 using the Harmonic algorithm; further variations of this\nalgorithm can push down the competitive ratio to 1.588. However, Harmonic and\nits variations have poor performance on average; in particular, Harmonic has\naverage-case ratio of around 1.27. In this paper, first we introduce a simple\nalgorithm which we term Harmonic Match.

For instance, the key disease\nspreaders might not necessarily be so when it comes to analyze social contagion\nor rumor propagation. Additionally, it has been shown that different metrics\n(degree, coreness, etc) might identify different influential nodes even for the\nsame dynamical processes with diverse degree of accuracy. In this paper, we\ninvestigate how nine centrality measures correlate with the disease and rumor\nspreading capabilities of the nodes that made up different synthetic and\nreal-world (both spatial and non-spatial) networks.

On the contrary, for spatial networks, the\naccessibility measure outperforms the rest of centrality metrics in almost all\ncases regardless of the kind of dynamics considered. Therefore, an important\nconsequence of our analysis is that previous studies performed in synthetic\nrandom networks cannot be generalized to the case of spatial networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 13:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-18"}

Using\nthe background field technique, this requirement translates into the condition\nof an unbroken split-symmetry connecting the (quantized) metric fluctuations to\nthe (classical) background metric. If the regularization scheme used violates\nsplit-symmetry during the quantization process it is mandatory to restore it in\nthe end at the level of observable physics. In this paper we present a detailed\ninvestigation of split-symmetry breaking and restoration within the Effective\nAverage Action (EAA) approach to Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) with a special\nemphasis on the Asymptotic Safety conjecture. In particular we demonstrate for\nthe first time in a non-trivial setting that the two key requirements of\nBackground Independence and Asymptotic Safety can be satisfied simultaneously.\nCarefully disentangling fluctuation and background fields, we employ a\n`bi-metric' ansatz for the EAA and project the flow generated by its functional\nrenormalization group equation on a truncated theory space spanned by two\nseparate Einstein-Hilbert actions for the dynamical and the background metric,\nrespectively. A new powerful method is used to derive the corresponding\nrenormalization group (RG) equations for the Newton- and cosmological constant,\nboth in the dynamical and the background sector. We classify and analyze their\nsolutions in detail, determine their fixed point structure, and identify an\nattractor mechanism which turns out instrumental in the split-symmetry\nrestoration.

Under the action of external forcing like\nheating individual events of convection respond to the slow accumulation of\nvapor by a threshold-type dynamics. This is due to the a time-scale separation,\nbetween the slow drive and the fast convective response, expressed as the\n\"quasi-equilibrium\". When there is interaction between the convection plumes,\nthe effect is a correlated response. We show that the correlated response have\nmany of the characteristics of the self-organized criticality (SOC).

The aim of this paper is twofold: first we discover isomorphisms\nbetween shearlet groups and other well-known groups, namely extended Heisenberg\ngroups and subgroups of the symplectic group. Interestingly, the connected\nshearlet group with positive dilations has an isomorphic copy in the symplectic\ngroup, while this is not true for the full shearlet group with all nonzero\ndilations. Indeed we prove the general result that there exist, up to adjoint\naction of the symplectic group, only one embedding of the extended Heisenberg\nalgebra into the Lie algebra of the symplectic group.\n  Having understood the various group isomorphisms it is natural to ask for the\nrelations between coorbit spaces of isomorphic groups with equivalent\nrepresentations.

We define the\ntask of visualization in risk communication, discuss the structure of\nmacroprudential data, and review visualization techniques applied to systemic\nrisk. We conclude that two essential, yet rare, features for supporting the\nanalysis of big data and communication of risks are analytical visualizations\nand interactive interfaces. For visualizing the so-called macroprudential data\ncube, we provide the VisRisk platform with three modules: plots, maps and\nnetworks. While VisRisk is herein illustrated with five web-based interactive\nvisualizations of systemic risk indicators and models, the platform enables and\nis open to the visualization of any data from the macroprudential data cube.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 15:05:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 May 2014 14:28:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 15:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-27"}

It\nis shown that the new theory can explain and deal with the conflicting evidence\nin a more reasonable way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 08:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-21"}

It also has the great potential to reduce the\ncomputational burden associated with topology optimization substantially. Some\nrepresentative examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 14:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Exact agreement\nwith the probabilistic predictions of quantum theory is achieved in the model\nwithout data rejection, remote contextuality, superdeterminism or backward\ncausation. A singularity-free Clifford-algebraic representation of S^3 with\nvanishing spatial curvature and non-vanishing torsion is then employed to\ntransform the model in a more elegant form. Several event-by-event numerical\nsimulations of the model are presented, which confirm our analytical results\nwith the accuracy of 4 parts in 10^4.
