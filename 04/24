We use this syzygy gap fractal to study, at once, the collection of\nall F-pure thresholds of all polynomials constructed with the same fixed linear\nforms. This allows us to describe the structure of the denominator of such an\nF-pure threshold, showing in particular that whenever the F-pure threshold\ndiffers from its expected value its denominator is a multiple of p. This\nanswers a question of Schwede in the two-variable homogeneous case.

While\nthere are a variety of metrics that can be used to specify the quality of a\ngiven community, one common theme is that flows tend to stay within\ncommunities. Hence, we expect cycles to play an important role in community\ndetection. For undirected graphs, the importance of triangles -- an undirected\n3-cycle -- has been known for a long time and can be used to improve community\ndetection. In directed graphs, the situation is more nuanced. The smallest\ncycle is simply two nodes with a reciprocal connection, and using information\nabout reciprocation has proven to improve community detection. Our new idea is\nbased on the four types of directed triangles that contain cycles. To identify\ncommunities in directed networks, then, we propose an undirected edge-weighting\nscheme based on the type of the directed triangles in which edges are involved.\nWe also propose a new metric on quality of the communities that is based on the\nnumber of 3-cycles that are split across communities. To demonstrate the impact\nof our new weighting, we use the standard METIS graph partitioning tool to\ndetermine communities and show experimentally that the resulting communities\nresult in fewer 3-cycles being cut. The magnitude of the effect varies between\na 10 and 50% reduction, and we also find evidence that this weighting scheme\nimproves a task where plausible ground-truth communities are known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 16:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-24"}

We consider a situation in which, in spite of high\nintraspecific competition, individuals leave most of a key resource\nunexploited. The parasitic wasp that does this finds virtually all host egg\nclusters in a landscape, but parasitizes only about a third of the eggs in\neach, and then leaves a deterrent mark around the cluster.

We then\nconsider classical hypotheses for the evolution of restraint. Prudent predation\nand bet-hedging fail as explanations because the wasp lives as a large\nwell-mixed population. Also, we find no individual benefits to the parasitoid\nof developing in a sparsely parasitized host nest.

An inversion technique based on the spherically symmetric\ngeometry (Spherically Symmetric Inversion, SSI) was developed in the 1950s, and\nhas been widely applied to interpret various observations. However, to date\nthere is no study about uncertainty estimation of this method. In this study we\npresent the detailed assessment of this method using a three-dimensional (3D)\nelectron density in the corona from 1.5 to 4 Rsun as a model, which is\nreconstructed by tomography method from STEREO/COR1 observations during solar\nminimum in February 2008. We first show in theory and observation that the\nspherically symmetric polynomial approximation (SSPA) method and the Van de\nHulst inversion technique are equivalent. Then we assess the SSPA method using\nsynthesized pB images from the 3D density model, and find that the SSPA density\nvalues are close to the model inputs for the streamer core near the plane of\nthe sky (POS) with differences generally less than a factor of two or so; the\nformer has the lower peak but more spread in both longitudinal and latitudinal\ndirections than the latter. We estimate that the SSPA method may resolve the\ncoronal density structure near the POS with angular resolution in longitude of\nabout 50 degrees. Our results confirm the suggestion that the SSI method is\napplicable to the solar minimum streamer (belt) as stated in some previous\nstudies. In addition, we demonstrate that the SSPA method can be used to\nreconstruct the 3D coronal density, roughly in agreement with that by\ntomography for a period of low solar activity.

We employ\nthese tools to derive price of anarchy results for social welfare and revenue.\nOur approach separates the standard smoothness framework into two distinct\nparts, isolating the analysis common to any auction from the analysis specific\nto a given auction. The first part relates a bidder's contribution to welfare\nin equilibrium to their contribution to welfare in the optimal auction using\nthe price the bidder faces for additional allocation. Intuitively, either an\nagent's utility and hence contribution to welfare is high, or the price she has\nto pay for additional allocation is high relative to her value. We call this\ncondition value covering; it holds in every Bayes-Nash equilibrium of any\nauction. The second part, revenue covering, relates the prices bidders face for\nadditional allocation to the revenue of the auction, using an auction's rules\nand feasibility constraints. Combining the two parts gives approximation\nresults to the optimal welfare, and, under the right conditions, the optimal\nrevenue. In mechanisms with reserve prices, our welfare results show\napproximation with respect to the optimal mechanism with the same reserves.\n  As a center-piece result, we analyze the single-item first-price auction with\nindividual monopoly reserves. When each distribution satisfies a regularity\ncondition the auction's revenue is at least a $2e/(e-1) \\approx 3.16$\napproximation to the revenue of the optimal auction. We also give bounds for\nmatroid auctions with first-price or all-pay semantics, and the generalized\nfirst-price position auction.

If the CO traced gas depletion\ntime (tau_mol) is constant, and if CO only traces star forming giant molecular\nclouds (GMCs), then the physical properties of each GMC must vary, such as the\nvolume densities or star formation rates. Another possibility is that the\nconversion between CO luminosity and Sigmol, the XCO factor, differs from\ncloud-to-cloud.

The CO bright diffuse gas can explain the sublinear KS\nrelationship, and consequently leads to an increasing tau_mol with Sigmol. If\nSigsfr linearly correlates with the dense gas surface density, a sublinear KS\nrelationship indicates that the fraction of diffuse gas fdiff grows with\nSigmol. In galaxies where Sigmol falls towards the outer disk, this description\nsuggests that fdiff also decreases radially.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 20:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

A mechanism designer can potentially\nlearn about the participants' preferences by observing historical data from the\nmechanism; the designer could then update the mechanism in response to learned\npreferences to improve its performance. The challenge of such an approach is\nthat the data corresponds to the actions of the participants and not their\npreferences.

In the optimal auction\nexample, it is impossible to learn anything about preferences of bidders who\nare not willing to pay the reserve price.

Finally, we provide evidence that the perturbatively stable vacua\nhave a non-perturbative instability to spontaneously sprout lumps; we give an\nestimate of the decay rate and argue that generically it is exponentially\nfaster than all other known decays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 20:51:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 17:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-24"}

In this paper, the popular stochastic block\nmodel (SBM) is extended to the generalized stochastic block model (GSBM) that\nallows for adversarial outlier nodes, which are connected with the other nodes\nin the graph in an arbitrary way. Under this model, we introduce a procedure\nusing convex optimization followed by $k$-means algorithm with $k=r$. Both\ntheoretical and numerical properties of the method are analyzed. A theoretical\nguarantee is given for the procedure to accurately detect the communities with\nsmall misclassification rate under the setting where the number of clusters can\ngrow with $N$. This theoretical result admits to the best-known result in the\nliterature of computationally feasible community detection in SBM without\noutliers. Numerical results show that our method is both computationally fast\nand robust to different kinds of outliers, while some popular computationally\nfast community detection algorithms, such as spectral clustering applied to\nadjacency matrices or graph Laplacians, may fail to retrieve the major clusters\ndue to a small portion of outliers.

It may be due to an intrinsically asymmetric outflow\nlaunch mechanism, or it may be caused by the effects of the ambient medium\nsurrounding the YSO. Answering this question is an important step in\nunderstanding outflow launching. We have investigated the bipolar outflows\ndriven by the T Tauri star DG Tauri on scales of hundreds of AU, using the\nNear-infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) on Gemini North. The\napproaching outflow consists of a well-collimated jet, nested within a\nlower-velocity disc wind. The receding outflow is composed of a\nsingle-component bubble-like structure. We analyse the kinemat- ics of the\nreceding outflow using kinetic models, and determine that it is a\nquasi-stationary bubble with an expanding internal velocity field. We propose\nthat this bubble forms because the receding counterjet from DG Tau is\nobstructed by a clumpy ambient medium above the circumstellar disc surface,\nbased on similarities between this structure and those found in the modeling of\nactive galactic nuclei outflows. We find evidence of interaction between the\nobscured counterjet and clumpy ambient material, which we attribute to the\nlarge molecular envelope around the DG Tau system. An analytical model of a\nmomentum-driven bubble is shown to be consistent with our interpretation. We\nconclude that the bipolar outflow from DG Tau is intrinsically symmetric, and\nthe observed asymmetries are due to environmental effects. This mechanism can\npotentially be used to explain the observed bipolar asymmetries in other YSO\noutflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 00:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Recent molecular observations toward the\nDHN by Enokiya et al. (2014) revealed two candidate molecular counterparts of\nthe DHN at radial velocities of -35 km/s and 0 km/s and discussed the model in\nwhich the DHN has its origin at the circumnuclear disk in the GC. In this\npaper, new CO observations toward the DHN using the CSO and Mopra telescopes\nare presented. The higher-resolution observations of ~1 pc scale reveal the\ndetailed distributions and kinematics of the two CO counterparts (the 0 km/s\nand -35 km/s features) and provide new information on their physical\nconditions. As a result, we find that the 0 km/s feature with a mass of\n3.3x10^4 Msun coincides with the infrared emission of the DHN, indicating clear\nassociation with the DHN. The association of the -35 km/s feature, with a mass\nof 0.8x10^4 Msun, is less clear compared with the 0 km/s feature, but the\ncomplementary distribution between the molecular gas and the DHN and velocity\nvariation along the DHN support its association with the DHN. The two molecular\nfeatures are highly excited, as shown by the relatively high CO J=2-1/J=1-0\nintensity ratios of ~1.0, and have kinetic temperatures of ~30 K, consistent\nwith the typical molecular clouds in the GC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 06:20:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Analysing variability of fshapes'\nensembles require the modelling and quantification of joint variations in\ngeometry and signal, which have been treated separately in previous approaches.\nInstead, building on the ideas of shape spaces for purely geometrical objects,\nwe propose the extended concept of fshape bundles and define Riemannian metrics\nfor fshape metamorphoses to model geometrico-functional transformations within\nthese bundles. We also generalize previous works on data attachment terms based\non the notion of varifolds and demonstrate the utility of these distances.\nBased on these, we propose variational formulations of the atlas estimation\nproblem on populations of fshapes and prove existence of solutions for the\ndifferent models.

Such a\ncontention-based protocol not only wastes lots of channel time on multiple\nrounds of contention, but also fails to maximally deliver the gain of MU-MIMO\nbecause users randomly join concurrent transmissions without considering their\nchannel characteristics. To address such inefficiency, this paper introduces\nMIMOMate, a leader-contention-based MU-MIMO MAC protocol that matches clients\nas concurrent transmitters according to their channel characteristics to\nmaximally deliver the MU-MIMO gain, while ensuring all users to fairly share\nconcurrent transmission opportunities. Furthermore, MIMOMate elects the leader\nof the matched users to contend for transmission opportunities using\ntraditional 802.11 CSMA/CA. It hence requires only a single contention overhead\nfor concurrent streams, and can be compatible with legacy 802.11 devices.

Typically, in such situations, the scalar power spectrum\nexhibits a burst of features associated with modes that leave the Hubble radius\neither immediately before or during the epoch of fast roll. Moreover, one also\nfinds that the power spectrum turns scale invariant at smaller scales\ncorresponding to modes that leave the Hubble radius at later stages, when slow\nroll has been restored. In other words, the imprints of brief departures from\nslow roll, arising out of sharp shapes in the inflaton potential, are usually\nof a finite width in the scalar power spectrum. Intuitively, one may imagine\nthat the scalar bi-spectrum too may exhibit a similar behavior, i.e. a\nrestoration of scale invariance at small scales, when slow roll has been\nreestablished. However, in the case of the Starobinsky model (viz. the model\ndescribed by a linear inflaton potential with a sudden change in its slope)\ninvolving the canonical scalar field, it has been found that, a rather sharp,\nthough short, departure from slow roll can leave a lasting and significant\nimprint on the bi-spectrum. The bi-spectrum in this case is found to grow\nlinearly with the wavenumber at small scales, a behavior which is clearly\nunphysical. In this work, we study the effects of smoothening the discontinuity\nin the Starobinsky model on the scalar bi-spectrum. Focusing on the equilateral\nlimit, we analytically show that, for smoother potentials, the bi-spectrum\nindeed turns scale invariant at suitably large wavenumbers.

We investigated the constraints provided by considering\nsimultaneously the observed spread of lithium and oxygen (and when possible\nalso sodium) abundances for samples of turn-off stars in NGC6752, NGC6121 (M4),\nand NGC104 (47Tuc), and the helium abundance of their multiple main sequences.\nThese observations provide a very powerful test for the accretion scenario,\nbecause the observed O, Li and He abundance distributions at the turn off can\nbe used to constrain the composition (and mass) of the accreted matter, and the\ntimescales of the polluting stars.

The theory is based on\ngeneralized antisymmetric brackets and naturally predicts open-path\noff-diagonal geometric phases in the evolution of the density matrix. It is\nshown that such geometric phases must also be considered in the\nquantum-classical Liouville equation for a classical bath with canonical phase\nspace coordinates; this occurs whenever the adiabatics basis is complex (as in\nthe case of a magnetic field coupled to the quantum subsystem). When the\nquantum subsystem is weakly coupled to the spin environment, non-adiabatic\ntransitions can be neglected and one can construct an effective non-Markovian\ncomputer simulation scheme for open quantum system dynamics in classical spin\nenvironments. In order to tackle this case, integration algorithms based on the\nsymmetric Trotter factorization of the classical-like spin propagator are\nderived. Such algorithms are applied to a model comprising a quantum two-level\nsystem coupled to a single classical spin in an external magnetic field.\nStarting from an excited state, the population difference and the coherences of\nthis two-state model are simulated in time while the dynamics of the classical\nspin is monitored in detail. It is the author's opinion that the numerical\nevidence provided in this paper is a first step toward developing the\nsimulation of quantum dynamics in classical spin environments into an effective\ntool. In turn, the ability to simulate such a dynamics can have a positive\nimpact on various fields, among which, for example, nano-science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 15:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-21"}

In the context of the Herschel DUNES key programme the disc was observed\nand spatially resolved in the far-IR with the Herschel PACS and SPIRE\ninstruments. In a first model, Ertel et al. (2014) assumed the size and radial\ndistribution of the circumstellar dust to be independent power laws. There, by\nexploring a very broad range of possible model parameters several scenarios\ncapable of explaining the observations were suggested. In this paper, we\nperform a follow-up in-depth collisional modelling of these scenarios trying to\nfurther distinguish between them. In our models we consider collisions, direct\nradiation pressure, and drag forces, i.e. the actual physical processes\noperating in debris discs. We find that all scenarios discussed in Ertel et al.\nare physically sensible and can reproduce the observed SED along with the PACS\nsurface brightness profiles reasonably well. In one model, the dust is produced\nbeyond 120au in a narrow planetesimal belt and is transported inwards by\nPoynting-Robertson and stellar wind drag. A good agreement with the observed\nradial profiles would require stellar winds by about an order of magnitude\nstronger than the solar value, which is not supported, although not ruled out,\nby observations. Another model consists of two spatially separated planetesimal\nbelts, a warm inner and a cold outer one. This scenario would probably imply\nthe presence of planets clearing the gap between the two components. Finally,\nwe show qualitatively that the observations can be explained by assuming the\ndust is produced in a single, but broad planetesimal disc with a surface\ndensity of solids rising outwards, as expected for an extended disc that\nexperiences a natural inside-out collisional depletion. Prospects of\ndiscriminating between the competing scenarios by future observations are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 15:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

The overall lifetimes of hydrogen bonds (HBs) of\nsurface bound waters are more than at least 1-2 orders of magnitude longer than\nbulk water. Slow hydration dynamics, revealed in non-Arrhenius behavior of the\nrelaxation time, arises from high activation barriers to break water hydrogen\nbonds with a nucleotide and by reduced diffusion of water. The relaxation\nkinetics at specific locations in the two RNAs show a broad spectrum of time\nscales reminiscent of glass-like behavior, suggesting that the hydration\ndynamics is highly heterogeneous.

The second order non-equilibrium thermodynamical\nprescription of Israel and Stewart has been presented with particle creation\nrate, treated as the dissipative effect. In the background of a flat FRW model,\nwe assume the non-equilibrium thermodynamical process to be isentropic so that\nthe entropy per particle does not change and consequently the dissipative\npressure can be expressed linearly in terms of the particle creation rate. Here\nthe dissipative pressure behaves as a dynamical variable having a non-linear\ninhomogeneous evolution equation and the entropy flow vector satisfies the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. Further, using the Friedmann equations and by\nproper choice of the particle creation rate as a function of the Hubble\nparameter, it is possible to show (separately) a transition from the\ninflationary phase to the radiation era and also from matter dominated era to\nlate time acceleration. Also, in analogy to analytic continuation, it is\npossible to show a continuous cosmic evolution from inflation to late time\nacceleration by adjusting the parameters.

The first counterexample forces Cantor's Diagonal\nMethod (DM) to yield one of the numbers in the target list. To study this\nanomaly, and given that for the DM to work the list of numbers have to be\nwritten down, the set of numbers that can be represented using positional\nfractional notation, $\\mathbb{W}$, is properly characterized. It is then shown\nthat $\\mathbb{W}$ is not isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$, meaning that results\nobtained from the application of the DM to $\\mathbb{W}$ in order to derive\nproperties of $\\mathbb{R}$ are not valid. It is then shown that Cantor's DM for\na generic list of reals can be forced to yield one of the numbers of the list,\nthus invalidating Cantor's result that infers the non-denumerability of\n$\\mathbb{R}$ from the application of the DM to $\\mathbb{W}$. Cantor's Theorem\nabout the different cardinalities of a set and its power set is then\nquestioned, and by means of another counterexample we show that the theorem\ndoes not actually hold for infinite sets. After analyzing all these results, it\nis shown that the current notion of cardinality for infinite sets does not\ndepend on the size of the sets, but rather on the representation chosen for\nthem. Following this line of thought, the concept of model as a framework for\nthe construction of the representation of a set is introduced, and a theorem\nshowing that an infinite set can be well-ordered if there is a proper model for\nit is proven. To reiterate that the cardinality of a set does not determine\nwhether the set can be well-ordered, a set of cardinality\n$\\aleph_{0}^{\\aleph_{0}}$ is proven to be equipollent to the set of natural\nnumbers $\\mathbb{N}$. The paper concludes with an analysis of the cardinality\nof the ordinal numbers, for which a representation of cardinality\n$\\aleph_{0}^{\\aleph_{0}}$ is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 15:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-28"}

The yield surface is\nsmooth and particularly suited to represent the behaviour of rock-like\nmaterials, such as concrete, mortar, ceramic and rock. A new class of isotropic\nhardening laws is proposed, which can be given both an incremental and the\ncorresponding finite form. These laws describe a smooth transition from linear\nelastic to plastic behaviour, incorporating linear and nonlinear hardening, and\nmay approach the perfectly plastic limit in the latter case. The reliability of\nthe model is demonstrated by its capability of correctly describing the results\nyielded by a number of well documented triaxial tests on concrete subjected to\nvarious confinement levels. Thanks to its simplicity, the model turns out to be\nvery robust and well suited to be used in complex design situations, as those\ninvolving dynamic loads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 08:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-28"}

In this work, we propose a model\nthat makes baby steps towards addressing these challenges.

The\nfunctional average $\\langle q_m^2 \\rangle$ of the square of the coordinate at a\ntime $t_m$ which is intermediate between the initial and final time gives a\nmeasure of the amplitude of quantum fluctuations with respect to the classical\npath. This average, or \"transition element\", is divergent in the massless\nlimit, signaling a quantum runaway. We show that the divergence is not due to\nthe continuum limit and formulate the conjecture that the divergent\ncontributions come from regions where the action $S$ is constant and therefore\nthe interference factor $e^{-iS/\\hbar}$ does not oscillate. For most systems\nthese regions have zero functional measure and thus give a null contribution to\nthe path integral, but this is not the case for the massless oscillator.
