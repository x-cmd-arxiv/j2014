One of the most significant differences is a resistivity\nthat is linear in temperature and rises to well above the Ioffe-Regel limit\n(where the mean-free path is equal to the lattice spacing). Using an exact Kubo\nformula, we show that a linear resistivity naturally occurs for many systems\nwhen they are in an incoherent intermediate-temperature state. We verify the\nanalytic arguments with numerical calculations for a simplified version of the\nHubbard model which is solved with dynamical mean-field theory.

One of the research endeavors of this line\nof work is understanding the algorithmic and computational complexity of\ndesigning efficient signaling schemes. In reality, however, information is\ntypically not held by a central authority, but is distributed among multiple\nsources (third-party \"mediators\"), a fact that dramatically changes the\nstrategic and combinatorial nature of the signaling problem, making it a game\nbetween information providers, as opposed to a traditional mechanism design\nproblem.\n  In this paper we introduce {\\em distributed signaling games}, while using\ndisplay advertising as a canonical example for introducing this foundational\nframework. A distributed signaling game may be a pure coordination game (i.e.,\na distributed optimization task), or a non-cooperative game. In the context of\npure coordination games, we show a wide gap between the computational\ncomplexity of the centralized and distributed signaling problems.

Supercoiling is also important for large scale\norganisation of the genome in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.

In this paper, we apply the first-principles-based\nphonon Boltzmann transport equation to investigate the thermal conductivity of\nsilicene as well as the phonon scattering mechanisms. Although both graphene\nand silicene are two-dimensional crystals with similar crystal structure, we\nfind that phonon transport in silicene is quite different from that in\ngraphene. The thermal conductivity of silicene shows a logarithmic increase\nwith respect to the sample size due to the small scattering rates of acoustic\nin-plane phonon modes, while that of graphene is finite. Detailed analysis of\nphonon scattering channels shows that the linear dispersion of the acoustic\nout-of-plane (ZA) phonon modes, which is induced by the buckled structure,\nmakes the long-wavelength longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon modes in silicene\nnot as efficiently scattered as that in graphene. Compared with graphene, where\nmost of the heat is carried by the acoustic out-of-plane (ZA) phonon modes, the\nZA phonon modes in silicene only have ~10% contribution to the total thermal\nconductivity, which can also be attributed to the buckled structure. This\nsystematic comparison of phonon transport and thermal conductivity of silicene\nand graphene using the first-principle-based calculations shed some light on\nother two-dimensional materials, such as two-dimensional transition metal\ndichalcogenides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 16:40:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 23:38:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Dec 2014 22:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

However, the recent discovery of the\npowerful class of zero-determinant strategies in the iterated prisoner's\ndilemma suggests that we may have underestimated the degree of control that a\nsingle player can exert. Here, we develop a theory for zero-determinant\nstrategies for multiplayer social dilemmas, with any number of involved\nplayers. We distinguish several particularly interesting subclasses of\nstrategies: fair strategies ensure that the own payoff matches the average\npayoff of the group; extortionate strategies allow a player to perform above\naverage; and generous strategies let a player perform below average. We use\nthis theory to explore how individuals can enhance their strategic options by\nforming alliances. The effects of an alliance depend on the size of the\nalliance, the type of the social dilemma, and on the strategy of the allies:\nfair alliances reduce the inequality within their group; extortionate alliances\noutperform the remaining group members; but generous alliances increase\nwelfare. Our results highlight the critical interplay of individual control and\nalliance formation to succeed in large groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 17:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}

We have performed an efficient\nstrong-MgII-selected survey for UV DLAs at redshifts z=[0.42,0.70] using HST's\nlow-resolution ACS-HRC-PR200L prism. This redshift interval covers ~1.8 Gyr in\ncosmic time, i.e., t~[7.2,9.0] Gyrs after the Big Bang. A total of 96 strong\nMgII absorption-line systems identified in SDSS spectra were successfully\nobserved with the prism at the predicted UV wavelengths of Ly-alpha absorption.\nWe found that 35 of the 96 systems had a significant probability of being DLAs.\nOne additional observed system could be a very high N(HI) DLA (N(HI)~2x10^22\natoms cm^-2 or possibly higher), but since very high N(HI) systems are\nextremely rare, it would be unusual for this system to be a DLA given the size\nof our sample. Here we present information on our prism sample, including our\nbest estimates of N(HI) and errors for the 36 systems fitted with damped\nLy-alpha profiles. This list is valuable for future follow-up studies of\nlow-redshift DLAs in a small redshift interval, although such work would\nclearly benefit from improved UV spectroscopy to more accurately determine\ntheir neutral hydrogen column densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 19:30:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2015 20:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

It is intriguing to\nconsider the possibility that such events are probing physics beyond the\nstandard model. In this context, $\\mathcal{O}$(PeV) dark matter particles\ndecaying to neutrinos have been considered while dark matter annihilation has\nbeen dismissed invoking the unitarity bound as a limiting factor. However, the\nlatter claim was done ignoring the contribution from dark matter substructure,\nwhich for PeV Cold Dark Matter would extend down to a free streaming mass of\n$\\mathcal{O}$($10^{-18}$M$_\\odot$). Since the unitarity bound is less stringent\nat low velocities, ($\\sigma_{\\rm ann}$v)$\\leq4\\pi/m_\\chi^2v$, then, it is\npossible that these cold and dense subhalos would contribute dominantly to a\ndark-matter-induced neutrino flux and easily account for the events observed by\nIceCube. A Sommerfeld-enhanced dark matter model can naturally support such\nscenario. Interestingly, the spatial distribution of the events shows features\nthat would be expected in a dark matter interpretation. Although not\nconclusive, 9 of the 37 events appear to be clustered around a region near the\nGalactic Center while 6 others spatially coincide, within the reported angular\nerrors, with 5 of 26 Milky Way satellites. However, a simple estimate of the\nprobability of the latter occurring by chance is $\\sim35\\%$. More events are\nneeded to statistically test this hypothesis. PeV dark matter particles are\nmassive enough that their abundance as standard thermal relics would overclose\nthe Universe. This issue can be solved in alternative scenarios, for instance\nif the decay of new massive unstable particles generates significant entropy\nreheating the Universe to a slightly lower temperature than the freeze-out\ntemperature, $T_{\\rm RH} \\lesssim T_{\\rm f}\\sim4\\times10^4$~GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 20:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 14:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Then, once the arrival rate becomes known, the\ncall center may be over-staffed, in which case staff are being paid to be idle,\nor under-staffed, in which case many callers hang-up in the face of long wait\ntimes. Firms that have chosen to keep their call center operations in-house can\nmitigate this problem by co-sourcing; that is, by sometimes outsourcing calls.\nThen, the required staffing $N$ depends on how the firm chooses which calls to\noutsource in real-time, after the arrival rate realizes and the call center\noperates as a $M/M/N+M$ queue with an outsourcing option. Our objective is to\nfind a joint policy for staffing and call outsourcing that minimizes the long\nrun average cost of this two-stage stochastic program when there is a linear\nstaffing cost per unit time and linear costs associated with abandonments and\noutsourcing.\n  We propose a policy that uses a square-root safety staffing rule, and\noutsources calls in accordance with a threshold rule that characterizes when\nthe system is \"too crowded\". Analytically, we establish that our proposed\npolicy is asymptotically optimal, as the mean arrival rate becomes large, when\nthe level of uncertainty in the arrival rate is of the same order as the\ninherent system fluctuations in the number of waiting customers for a known\narrival rate. Through an extensive numerical study, we establish that our\npolicy is extremely robust. In particular, our policy performs remarkably well\nover a wide range of parameters, and far beyond where it is proved to be\nasymptotically optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 20:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-14"}

We study equilibration and relaxation of the\nsupercooled SW Si, in the temperature range of 1060 K--1070 K at zero pressure.\nWe find that as the relaxation of the metastable supercooled liquid phase\ninitiates, a straight line region (SLR) is formed in cumulative potential\nenergy distributions. The configurational temperature corresponding to the SLR\nis close to 1060 K, which was earlier identified as the freezing temperature of\n4-coordinated amorphous network. The SLR is found to be tangential to the\ndistribution of the metastable liquid phase and thus influences the broadness\nof the distribution. As the bath temperature is reduced from 1070 K to 1060 K,\nthe effective temperature approaches the bath temperature which results in\nbroadening of the metastable phase distribution. This, in turn, causes an\nincrease in overall fluctuations of potential energy and hence an increase of\nheat capacity. We also find that during initial stages of relaxation,\n4-coordinated atoms form 6-membered rings with a chair--like structure and\nother structural units that indicate crystallization. Simultaneously a strong\ncorrelation is established between the number of chair-shaped 6-membered rings\nand the number of 4-coordinated atoms in the system. This shows that all\nproperties related to 4-coordinated particles are highly correlated as the SLR\nis formed in potential energy distributions and this can be interpreted as a\nconsequence of `freezing' of amorphous network formed by 4-coordinated\nparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 20:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-14"}

We carry out Lyman-alpha radiation\ntransfer calculations in two models of HII regions which are porous to ionising\ncontinuum escape: 1) the so-called \"density bounded\" media, in which massive\nstars produce enough ionising photons to keep the surrounding interstellar\nmedium transparent to the ionising continuum, i.e almost totally ionised, and\n2) \"riddled ionisation-bounded\" media, surrounded by neutral interstellar\nmedium, but with holes, i.e. with a covering factor lower than unity.

Recent\ndetections have yielded enough information about this class of exoplanets to\nbegin characterizing their occurrence rates, orbits, masses, densities, and\ninternal structures. The Kepler mission finds the smallest planets to be most\ncommon, as 26% of Sun-like stars have small, 1-2 R_e planets with orbital\nperiods under 100 days, and 11% have 1-2 R_e planets that receive 1-4x the\nincident stellar flux that warms our Earth. These Earth-size planets are\nsprinkled uniformly with orbital distance (logarithmically) out to 0.4 AU, and\nprobably beyond. Mass measurements for 33 transiting planets of 1-4 R_e show\nthat the smallest of them, R < 1.5 R_e, have the density expected for rocky\nplanets. Their densities increase with increasing radius, likely caused by\ngravitational compression. Including solar system planets yields a relation:\nrho = 2.32 + 3.19 R/R_e [g/cc]. Larger planets, in the radius range 1.5-4.0\nR_e, have densities that decline with increasing radius, revealing increasing\namounts of low-density material in an envelope surrounding a rocky core,\nbefitting the appellation \"mini-Neptunes.\" Planets of ~1.5 R_e have the highest\ndensities, averaging near 10 g/cc. The gas giant planets occur preferentially\naround stars that are rich in heavy elements, while rocky planets occur around\nstars having a range of heavy element abundances. One explanation is that the\nfast formation of rocky cores in protoplanetary disks enriched in heavy\nelements permits the gravitational accumulation of gas before it vanishes,\nforming giant planets.

These superclusters survive\nin melts above the crystal melting temperature Tm because all their surface\natoms have the same fusion heat as their core atoms and are melted by\nhomogeneous nucleation of liquid in their core, depending on overheating time\nand temperature. In complete contrast to current ideas, a long time is\nnecessary to melt them and to attain the thermodynamic equilibrium above Tm.\nThey act as heterogeneous growth nuclei of crystallized phase at a temperature\nTc of the undercooled melt when they are not melted. They contribute to the\nreduction of the critical barrier, which becomes smaller than that of crystals\ncontaining the same atom number n. The undercooling rate is always limited,\neven in a liquid at thermodynamic equilibrium, because the homogeneous\nnucleation of 13-atom superclusters reduces the energy barrier, and increases\nTc above the homogeneous nucleation temperature equal to Tm/3 in liquid\nelements. After weak superheating, the most stable superclusters containing n =\n13, 55, 147, 309 and 561 atoms survive or melt and determine Tc during\nundercooling, which depends on n and on the sample volume. The experimental\nnucleation temperatures Tc of 32 liquid elements and the melting temperatures\nof superclusters are predicted without any adjustable parameter using a sample\nvolume varying by nearly 18 orders of magnitude.

To further explore the evolutionary stages of the\ncandidate YSOs, we fit the spectral energy distribution (SEDs) of 44 sources,\nwhich led to the identification of 14 Class I, 27 Class II, and 3 Class III\nYSOs. The spatial distribution of the classified YSOs at different evolutionary\nstages presents a spatio-temporal gradient, which is consistent with a scenario\nof sequential star formation. On the other hand, Herschel PACS observations\ntoward the interface between S155 and the ambient molecular cloud disclose an\narc-shaped dust layer, the origin of which could be attributed to the UV\ndissipation from the early type stars e.g. HD 217061 in S155. Four dusty cores\nwere revealed by the Herschel data, which hints for new generations of star\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2014 07:07:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

How the selection proceeds\nstepwise efficiently to achieve sufficiently high fidelity and speed is\nessential for polymerase function. We examined step-by-step selections that\nhave conformational transition rates tuned one at time in the polymerase\nelongation cycle, with a controlled differentiation free energy at each\ncheckpoint. The elongation is sustained at non-equilibrium steady state with\nconstant free energy input and heat dissipation. It is found that error\nreduction capability does not improve for selection checkpoints down the\nreaction path. Hence, it is essential to select early to achieve an efficient\nfidelity control. In particular, for two consecutive selections that reject the\nwrong substrate back and inhibit it forward from a same kinetic state, the same\nerror rates are obtained at the same free energy differentiation. The initial\nscreening is indispensible for maintaining the elongation speed high, as the\nwrong nucleotides can be removed quickly and replaced by the right nucleotides\nat the entry. Overall, the elongation error rate can be repeatedly reduced\nthrough multiple selection checkpoints.

Stellar\nmagnetic activity results from the interaction between rotation, convection,\nand magnetic field. Constraining these processes is important if we want to\nbetter understand stellar magnetic activity. Using the Sun, we want to test a\nmagnetic activity index based on the analysis of the photo- metric response and\nthen apply it to a sample of M dwarfs observed by Kepler. We estimate a global\nstellar magnetic activity index by measuring the standard deviation of the\nwhole time series, Sph. Because stellar variability can be related to\nconvection, pulsations, or magnetism, we need to ensure that this index mostly\ntakes into account magnetic effects. We define another stellar magnetic\nactivity index as the average of the standard deviation of shorter subseries\nwhich lengths are determined by the rotation period of the star. This way we\ncan ensure that the measured photometric variability is related to starspots\ncrossing the visible stellar disk. This new index combined with a\ntime-frequency analysis based on the Morlet wavelets allows us to determine the\nexistence of magnetic activity cycles. We measure magnetic indexes for the Sun\nand for 34 M dwarfs observed by Kepler. As expected, we obtain that the sample\nof M dwarfs studied in this work is much more active than the Sun. Moreover, we\nfind a small correlation between the rotation period and the magnetic index.\nFinally, by combining a time-frequency analysis with phase diagrams, we\ndiscover the presence of long-lived features suggesting the existence of active\nlongitudes on the surface of these stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2014 11:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-14"}

Neutrons generated at\nthese events can react with $^7$Be nuclei and reduce $^7$Be abundance solving a\nproblem of the primordial $^7$Li abundance. We suggest that thermal neutron\ninjection is a way to derive a model independent conservative limit on the\nrelation between abundances of D and $^7$Li in a hadronic energy injection\nmodel. We emphasize that an uncertainty in cross sections of inelastic $n+p$\nscattering affects the total number of induced neutrons, which determines final\nabundances of D and $^7$Li. In addition, the annihilations of antinucleons with\n$^4$He result in higher D abundance and trigger nonthermal $^6$Li production.\nIt is concluded that a reduction of $^7$Li abundance from a value in the\nstandard big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) model down to an observational two\n$\\sigma$ upper limit is necessarily accompanied by an undesirable increase of D\nabundance up to at least an observational 12 $\\sigma$ upper limit from\nobservations of quasi-stellar object absorption line systems.

With this field configuration,\nincoming cosmic rays experience both a funneling effect that acts to enhance\nthe flux impinging on the circumstellar disk and a magnetic mirroring effect\nthat acts to reduce that flux. To leading order, these effects nearly cancel\nout for simple underlying magnetic field structures. However, the environments\nsurrounding young stellar objects are expected to be highly turbulent. This\npaper shows how the presence of magnetic field fluctuations affects the process\nof magnetic mirroring, and thereby changes the flux of cosmic rays striking\ncircumstellar disks. Turbulence has two principle effects: 1) The (single)\nlocation of the magnetic mirror point found in the absence of turbulence is\nreplaced with a wide distribution of values. 2) The median of the mirror point\ndistribution moves outward for sufficiently large fluctuation amplitudes\n(roughly when $\\delta B/B_0>0.2$ at the location of the turbulence-free mirror\npoint); the distribution becomes significantly non-gaussian in this regime as\nwell. These results may have significant consequences for the ionization\nfraction of the disk, which in turn dictates the efficiency with which disk\nmaterial can accrete onto the central object. A similar reduction in cosmic ray\nflux can occur during the earlier protostellar stages; the decrease in\nionization can help alleviate the magnetic braking problem that inhibits disk\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2014 12:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

One of the simplest approaches to\nincorporate such fluctuations in energy transfer dynamics is the well known\nHaken-Strobl-Reineker model, in which the energy-gap fluctuation is\napproximated as a white noise. Recently, several groups have employed molecular\ndynamics simulations and excited-state calculations in conjunction to take the\nthermal fluctuation of excitation energies into account. Here, we discuss a\nrigorous connection between the stochastic and the atomistic bath models. If\nthe phonon bath is treated classically, time evolution of the exciton-phonon\nsystem can be described by Ehrenfest dynamics. To establish the relationship\nbetween the stochastic and atomistic bath models, we employ a projection\noperator technique to derive the generalized Langevin equations for the\nenergy-gap fluctuations. The stochastic bath model can be obtained as an\napproximation of the atomistic Ehrenfest equations via the generalized Langevin\napproach. Based on the connection, we propose a novel scheme to correct\nreorganization effects within the framework of stochastic models. The proposed\nscheme provides a better description of the population dynamics especially in\nthe regime of strong exciton-phonon coupling. Finally, we discuss the effect of\nthe bath reorganization in the absorption and fluorescence spectra of ideal\nJ-aggregates in terms of the Stokes shifts. For this purpose, we introduce a\nsimple relationship that relates the reorganization contribution to the Stokes\nshifts - the reorganization shift - to three parameters: the monomer\nreorganization energy, the relaxation time of the optical gap, and the exciton\ndelocalization length. This simple relationship allows one to classify the\norigin of the Stokes shifts in molecular aggregates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2014 02:09:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jun 2014 20:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In addition, by treating the superclusters as\nunbound systems, the theory leads to an accelerating expansion of the universe\nin line with observations and without requiring the need for dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 20:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}
