With a total mass of\n$\\sim2\\times10^4$ M$_\\odot$, the W43-MM1 ridge is one of the most convincing\ncandidate precursor of starburst clusters and thus one of the best place to\ninvestigate star formation. Methods: We used high-angular resolution maps\nobtained at 3 mm and 1 mm within W43-MM1 with the IRAM Plateau de Bure\nInterferometer to reveal a cluster of 11 massive dense cores (MDCs), and, one\nof the most massive protostellar cores known.

The formation of hadrons, which is the dynamical enforcement\nof the QCD confinement principle, is very poorly understood on the basis of\nfundamental theory, although detailed models such as the Lund string model or\ncluster hadronization models can generally be tuned to capture the main\nfeatures of hadronic final states.

In\nprinciple, two effects conspire against the development of Casimir effects in\nswimmer suspensions. First, at low Reynolds number, the force on any closed\nvolume vanishes, but here the relevant effect is the drag by the flow produced\nby the swimmers, which can be finite. Second, the fluid velocity and the\npressure are linear on the swimmer force dipoles, and averaging over the\nswimmer orientations would lead to a vanishing effect. However, being the\nsuspension a discrete system, the noise terms of the coarse grained equations\ndepend on the density, which itself fluctuates, resulting in effective\nnon-linear dynamics. Applying the tools developed for other non-equilibrium\nsystems to general coarse grained equations for swimmer suspensions, the\nCasimir drag is computed on immersed objects, and it is found to depend on the\ncorrelation function between the rescaled density and dipolar density fields.\nBy introducing a model correlation function with medium range order, explicit\nexpressions are obtained for the Casimir drag on a body.

We select\ngalaxies that have a stellar mass >3x10^10 Msun inside r=1 kpc out to z=2.5,\nusing the 3D-HST survey and data at low redshift. Remarkably, the number\ndensity of galaxies with dense cores appears to have decreased from z=2.5 to\nthe present. This decrease is probably mostly due to stellar mass loss and the\nresulting adiabatic expansion, with some contribution from merging. We infer\nthat dense cores were mostly formed at z>2.5, consistent with their largely\nquiescent stellar populations. While the cores appear to form early, the\ngalaxies in which they reside show strong evolution: their total masses\nincrease by a factor of 2-3 from z=2.5 to z=0 and their effective radii\nincrease by a factor of 5-6. As a result, the contribution of dense cores to\nthe total mass of the galaxies in which they reside decreases from ~50% at\nz=2.5 to ~15% at z=0. Because of their early formation, the contribution of\ndense cores to the total stellar mass budget of the Universe is a strong\nfunction of redshift. The stars in cores with M_1kpc>3x10^10 Msun make up ~0.1%\nof the stellar mass density of the Universe today but 10%-20% at z~2, depending\non their IMF.

This paper\ngeneralizes that approach. We present the second-order bias expression proposed\nby Cox and Snell for the ML estimator of this parameter. Moreover, the formula\nof the profile likelihood modified by Barndorff-Nielsen in terms of $L$ is\ndiscussed. Such derivations yield two new ML estimators for the parameter $L$,\nwhich are compared to the estimators proposed by Anfinsen et al. The\nperformance of these estimators is assessed by means of Monte Carlo\nexperiments, adopting three statistical measures as comparison criterion: the\nmean square error, the bias, and the coefficient of variation. Equivalently to\nthe simulation study, an application to actual PolSAR data concludes that the\nproposed estimators outperform all the others in homogeneous scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2014 20:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-22"}

To this end, we adopt a\npreprocessing step to detect potential human parts from each image (i.e., a set\nof \"candidates\") that allows us to have a manageable input space. In this way,\nthe simultaneous inference of HPE and GAC is converted to a structured learning\nproblem, where the inputs are the collections of candidate ensembles, the\noutputs are the joint labels of human parts and garment attributes, and the\njoint feature representation involves various cues such as pose-specific\nfeatures, garment-specific features, and cross-task features that encode\ncorrelations between human parts and garment attributes.

In particular, new items will be overlooked, impeding the development\nof new products online. Given limited resources, how to utilize the knowledge\nof recommender systems and design efficient marketing strategy for new items is\nextremely important. In this paper, we convert this ticklish issue into a clear\nmathematical problem based on a bipartite network representation. Under the\nmost widely used algorithm in real e-commerce recommender systems, so-called\nthe item-based collaborative filtering, we show that to simply push new items\nto active users is not a good strategy. To our surprise, experiments on real\nrecommender systems indicate that to connect new items with some less active\nusers will statistically yield better performance, namely these new items will\nhave more chance to appear in other users' recommendation lists. Further\nanalysis suggests that the disassortative nature of recommender systems\ncontributes to such observation. In a word, getting in-depth understanding on\nrecommender systems could pave the way for the owners to popularize their\ncold-start products with low costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Apr 2014 08:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Although these\nalgorithms are shown to converge to the fixed points that give feasible problem\nsolutions, the solutions often lack notion of problem optimality. This paper\nreconsiders well known fixed point algorithms such as those with standard and\ntype-II standard interference functions, and investigates the conditions under\nwhich they give optimal power control solutions by the recently proposed\nFast-Lipschitz optimization framework. When the qualifying conditions of\nFast-Lipschitz optimization apply, it is established that the fixed points are\nthe optimal solutions of radio power optimization problems. The analysis is\nperformed by a logarithmic transformation of variables that gives problems\ntreatable within the Fast-Lipschitz framework. It is shown how the logarithmic\nproblem constraints are contractive by the standard or type-II standard\nassumptions on the original power control problem, and how a set of cost\nfunctions fulfill the Fast-Lipschitz qualifying conditions. The analysis on non\nmonotonic interference function allows to establish a new qualifying condition\nfor Fast-Lipschitz optimization. The results are illustrated by considering\npower control problems with standard interference function, problems with\ntype-II standard interference functions, and a case of sub-homogeneous power\ncontrol problems.

While natural orbitals are known and applied since\nmany years in electronic structure applications, their potential for\ntime-dependent problems is being investigated only since recently. Correlated\ntwo-particle systems are of particular importance because the structure of the\ntwo-body reduced density matrix expanded in natural orbitals is known exactly\nin this case. However, in the time-dependent case the natural orbitals carry\ntime-dependent phases that allow for certain time-dependent gauge\ntransformations of the first kind. Different phase conventions will, in\ngeneral, lead to different equations of motion for the natural orbitals. A\nparticular phase choice allows us to derive the exact equations of motion for\nthe natural orbitals of any (laser-) driven two-electron system explicitly,\ni.e., without any dependence on quantities that, in practice, require further\napproximations. For illustration, we solve the equations of motion for a model\nhelium system. Besides calculating the spin-singlet and spin-triplet ground\nstates, we show that the linear response spectra and the results for resonant\nRabi flopping are in excellent agreement with the benchmark results obtained\nfrom the exact solution of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Apr 2014 13:47:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 09:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

To quantify the effect of selection on the highly variable elements\nof the receptor, we apply a probabilistic maximum likelihood approach to the\nanalysis of high-throughput sequence data from the $\\beta$-chain of human\nT-cell receptors. We quantify selection factors for V and J gene choice, and\nfor the length and amino-acid composition of the variable region. Our approach\nis necessary to disentangle the effects of selection from biases inherent in\nthe recombination process. Inferred selection factors differ little between\ndonors, or between naive and memory repertoires. The number of sequences shared\nbetween donors is well-predicted by the model, indicating a purely stochastic\norigin of such \"public\" sequences.

The behavior data in these systems are\ngenerated by live agents: once the systems change due to the adoption of the\nprediction models learnt from the behavior data, agents will observe and\nrespond to these changes by changing their own behaviors accordingly. As a\nresult, the behavior data will evolve and will not be identically and\nindependently distributed, posing great challenges to the theoretical analysis\non the machine learning algorithms for behavior prediction. To tackle this\nchallenge, in this paper, we propose to use Markov Chain in Random Environments\n(MCRE) to describe the behavior data, and perform generalization analysis of\nthe machine learning algorithms on its basis. Since the one-step transition\nprobability matrix of MCRE depends on both previous states and the random\nenvironment, conventional techniques for generalization analysis cannot be\ndirectly applied. To address this issue, we propose a novel technique that\ntransforms the original MCRE into a higher-dimensional time-homogeneous Markov\nchain. The new Markov chain involves more variables but is more regular, and\nthus easier to deal with. We prove the convergence of the new Markov chain when\ntime approaches infinity. Then we prove a generalization bound for the machine\nlearning algorithms on the behavior data generated by the new Markov chain,\nwhich depends on both the Markovian parameters and the covering number of the\nfunction class compounded by the loss function for behavior prediction and the\nbehavior prediction model.
