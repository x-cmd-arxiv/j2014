Since the velocity field is solenoidal in this case, it\ncan be written as the curl of a vector potential, which will then satisfy\nPoisson's equation with vorticity as a source term. In regions with zero\nvorticity, Poisson's equation reduces to Laplace's equation, and this allows\nfor the construction of harmonic potentials inside and outside circles and\nellipses, depending on the coordinate system. The vector potential is normal to\nthe coordinate plane, and is proportional to the scalar harmonic functions on\nthe plane, thereby guaranteeing that the velocity field is also harmonic and is\nlocated on the coordinate plane. The components of the velocity field normal to\neither a circle or an ellipse are continuous, but the tangential components are\ndiscontinuous, so that, in effect, a vortex sheet is introduced at these\nboundaries. This discontinuity is a measure of the vorticity, normal to the\nplane and distributed harmonically along the perimeter of the respective\ncircles or ellipses. An analytic expression for the streamlines is obtained\nwhich makes visualisation of vortices of various geometries and harmonicities\npossible. This approach also permits a reformulation of the notion of\nmultipolarity of vortices in the traditional sense of a multipolar expansion of\nthe Green's function for Poisson's equation. As an example of the applicability\nof this formulation to known vortical structures, Rankine vortices of different\ngeometries are expressed in terms of harmonic functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Apr 2014 16:21:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2014 22:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-06"}

CS theory enables exact reconstruction\nof a sparse signal from relatively few linear measurements via a suitable\nnonlinear minimization process. Conventional CS theory relies on vectorial data\nrepresentation, which results in good compression ratios at the expense of\nincreased computational complexity. In applications involving color images,\nvideo sequences, and multi-sensor networks, the data is intrinsically of\nhigh-order, and thus more suitably represented in tensorial form. Standard\napplications of CS to higher-order data typically involve representation of the\ndata as long vectors that are in turn measured using large sampling matrices,\nthus imposing a huge computational and memory burden. In this chapter, we\nintroduce Generalized Tensor Compressed Sensing (GTCS)--a unified framework for\ncompressed sensing of higher-order tensors which preserves the intrinsic\nstructure of tensorial data with reduced computational complexity at\nreconstruction. We demonstrate that GTCS offers an efficient means for\nrepresentation of multidimensional data by providing simultaneous acquisition\nand compression from all tensor modes.

Further investigation of\nthe algorithm showed that it had three serious drawbacks, which prevented its\nuse by practitioners: it is difficult to understand, it has large memory\nrequirements, and it is slow. This paper presents an alternate formulation of\nSSS*, in which it is implemented as a series of Alpha-Beta calls that use a\ntransposition table (AB- SSS*). The reformulation solves all three perceived\ndrawbacks of SSS*, making it a practical algorithm. Further, because the search\nis now based on Alpha-Beta, the extensive research on minimax search\nenhancements can be easily integrated into AB-SSS*. To test AB-SSS* in\npractise, it has been implemented in three state-of-the- art programs: for\ncheckers, Othello and chess. AB-SSS* is comparable in performance to Alpha-Beta\non leaf node count in all three games, making it a viable alternative to\nAlpha-Beta in practise. Whereas SSS* has usually been regarded as being\nentirely different from Alpha-Beta, it turns out to be just an Alpha-Beta\nenhancement, like null-window searching. This runs counter to published\nsimulation results. Our research leads to the surprising result that iterative\ndeepening versions of Alpha-Beta can expand fewer leaf nodes than iterative\ndeepening versions of SSS* due to dynamic move re-ordering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Apr 2014 20:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-08"}

Since real-life minimax trees are not\nuniform, the exact size of this tree is not known for most applications.\nFurther, most games have transpositions, implying that there exists a minimal\ngraph which is smaller than the minimal tree. For three games (chess, Othello\nand checkers) we compute the size of the minimal tree and the minimal graph.\nEmpirical evidence shows that in all three games, enhanced Alpha-Beta search is\ncapable of building a tree that is close in size to that of the minimal graph.\nHence, it appears game-playing programs build nearly optimal search trees.\nHowever, the conventional definition of the minimal graph is wrong. There are\nways in which the size of the minimal graph can be reduced: by maximizing the\nnumber of transpositions in the search, and generating cutoffs using branches\nthat lead to smaller search trees. The conventional definition of the minimal\ngraph is just a left-most approximation. Calculating the size of the real\nminimal graph is too computationally intensive. However, upper bound\napproximations show it to be significantly smaller than the left-most minimal\ngraph. Hence, it appears that game-playing programs are not searching as\nefficiently as is widely believed. Understanding the left-most and real minimal\nsearch graphs leads to some new ideas for enhancing Alpha-Beta search. One of\nthem, enhanced transposition cutoffs, is shown to significantly reduce search\ntree size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Apr 2014 20:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-08"}

An\nanalysis of the anisotropy terms of the model shows that this configuration is\nrelated to specific values of the ratio between the cubic and the effective\nuniaxial anisotropy. The mechanism behind this effect is related to particular\nfeatures of the anisotropy's energy landscape, since a global minima transition\nas a function of the applied field is required in the anisotropy terms. This\nnew mechanism for zigzags formation could be present in monocrystal\nferromagnetic thin films in a given range of thicknesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Apr 2014 22:33:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 13:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-11"}

We show that a mass gap and a\nfundamental color confinement scale arise when one extends the formalism of de\nAlfaro, Fubini and Furlan to frame-independent light-front Hamiltonian theory.\nRemarkably, the resulting light-front potential has a unique form of a harmonic\noscillator in the light-front invariant impact variable if one requires that\nthe action remains conformally invariant. The result is a single-variable\nrelativistic equation of motion for $q \\bar q$ bound states, a \"Light-Front\nShr\\\"odinger Equation\", analogous to the nonrelativistic radial Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, which incorporates color confinement and other essential\nspectroscopic and dynamical features of hadron physics, including a massless\npion for zero quark mass and linear Regge trajectories with the same slope in\nthe radial quantum number and orbital angular momentum. The same equations with\nthe correct hadron spin dependence arise from the holographic mapping of\nmodified AdS$_5$ space with a specific dilaton profile. A fundamental mass\nparameter $\\kappa$ appears, determining the hadron masses and the length scale\nwhich underlies hadron structure. Quark masses can be introduced to account for\nthe spectrum of strange hadrons. This Light-Front Holographic approach predicts\nnot only hadron spectroscopy successfully, but also hadronic form factors, the\nQCD running coupling at small virtuality, and the light-front wavefunctions of\nhadrons. Thus the combination of light-front dynamics, its holographic mapping\nto gravity in a higher-dimensional space and the dAFF procedure provides new\ninsight into the physics underlying color confinement, chiral invariance, and\nthe QCD mass scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Apr 2014 23:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

According to the criteria used to identify the particular classes of\ninterest, this process was declined into several research programs, of which\nsome of the most deeply investigated are the ones classifying sentences in\nprenex normal form in base of their prefix vocabulary. Unfortunately, almost\nall of these approaches did not shed any light on the reasons why modal logic\nis so robustly decidable. Trying to answer to this question, Andreka, van\nBenthem, and Nemeti introduced the guarded fragment of first-order logic, which\ngeneralizes the modal framework by essentially retaining all its fundamental\nproperties. They started, so, a completely new research program based on the\nway quantifications can be relativized.

Because the surface impedance of\neach layer is a tensor, an arbitrarily polarized incident field is scattered\ninto its constituent TE and TM components. This gives rise to transmitarrays\ncapable of altering the polarization state of an incident field. Various tensor\nimpedance transmitarray have been proposed in the literature to alter the\npolarization, however no comprehensive methodology has been proposed to design\nthese structures. In this work we propose a procedure for designing tensor\nimpedance transmitarrays using multi-conductor transmissionline (MTL) theory.\nWe treat the transmitarray by modelling free-space and the dielectric spacers\nas an MTL supporting TE and TM modes with each tensor impedance surface as a\nshunt load along the MTL. By using simple MTL concepts we can design a\ntransmitarray to be reflectionless while controlling the transmission through\nthe layers and thus the transmitted polarization state. We demonstrate this\nprocedure for two classes of tensor impedance transmitarrays while also\nvalidating the design using full-wave simulation.

Although it improves the star light rejection, SDI attenuates the\nsignature of off-axis companions to the star, just like angular differential\nimaging (ADI). However, the attenuation due to SDI has the peculiarity of being\ndependent on the spectral properties of the companions. To date, no study has\ninvestigated these effects. Our team is addressing this problem based on data\nfrom a direct imaging survey of 16 stars combining the phase-mask coronagraph,\nthe SDI and the ADI modes of VLT/NaCo. The objective of the survey is to search\nfor cool (Teff<1000-1300 K) giant planets at separations of 5-10 AU orbiting\nyoung, nearby stars (<200 Myr, <25 pc). The data analysis did not yield any\ndetections. As for the estimation of the sensitivity limits of SDI-processed\nimages, we show that it requires a different analysis than that used in\nADI-based surveys. Based on a method using the flux predictions of evolutionary\nmodels and avoiding the estimation of contrast, we determine directly the mass\nsensitivity limits of the survey for the ADI processing alone and with the\ncombination of SDI and ADI.

Roughly,\none splits the notion of $\\mu $-completeness into pieces, and asks for a\nuniform ultrafilter over $\\mu $ satisfying just some piece of $\\mu\n$-completeness.\n  Analogue local versions of weak compactness are harder to come by, since weak\ncompactness cannot be defined by using a single ultrafilter. We deal with the\nproblem by restricting just to a subset $P$ of all the partitions of $\\mu $\ninto $<\\mu $ classes and asking for some ultrafilter $D$ over $\\mu $ such that\nno partition in $P$ disproves the $\\mu $-completeness of $D$. By making $P$\nvary in appropriate classes, one gets both measurability and weak compactness,\nas well as possible intermediate notions of \"weak measurability\".\n  We systematize the above procedures and combine them to obtain variants of\nmeasurability which are at the same time weaker and local.

Our simulation and analytical\nresults reveal a strong dependence of myosin II minifilament dynamics on\nenvironmental stiffness that is reminiscent of the cellular response to\nsubstrate stiffness. For small stiffness, minifilaments form transient\ncrosslinks exerting short spikes of force with negligible mean. For large\nstiffness, minifilaments form near permanent crosslinks exerting a mean force\nwhich hardly depends on environmental elasticity. This functional switch arises\nbecause dissociation after the power stroke is suppressed by force (catch\nbonding) and because ensembles can no longer perform the power stroke at large\nforces.
