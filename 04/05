Under the day-ahead dynamic pricing\n(a.k.a. real time pricing) mechanism, a retailer obtains electricity in a\ntwosettlement wholesale market and serves its customers in real time. Without\nknowledge on the aggregated demand function of its customers, the retailer aims\nto maximize its retail surplus by sequentially adjusting its price based on the\nbehavior of its customers in the past. An online learning algorithm, referred\nto as piecewise linear stochastic approximation (PWLSA), is proposed. It is\nshown that PWLSA achieves the optimal rate of learning defined by the growth\nrate of cumulative regret. In particular, the regret of PWLSA is shown to grow\nlogarithmically with respect to the learning horizon, and no other on-line\nlearning algorithm can have the growth rate slower than that of PWLSA.\nSimulation studies are presented using traces of actual day-ahead prices, and\nPWLSA compares favorably under both static and dynamically changing parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2014 17:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-07"}

For this type of computation, one challenge is that the\ntime to execute a task for each machine is inherently variable, and the overall\nresponse time is constrained by the execution time of the slowest machine. To\naddress this issue, system designers introduce task replication, which sends\nthe same task to multiple machines, and obtains result from the machine that\nfinishes first. While task replication reduces response time, it usually\nincreases resource usage. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to\nanalyze the trade-off between response time and resource usage. We show that,\nwhile in general, there is a tension between response time and resource usage,\nthere exist scenarios where replicating tasks judiciously reduces completion\ntime and resource usage simultaneously. Given the execution time distribution\nfor machines, we investigate the conditions for a scheduling policy to achieve\noptimal performance trade-off, and propose efficient algorithms to search for\noptimal or near-optimal scheduling policies. Our analysis gives insights on\nwhen and why replication helps, which can be used to guide scheduler design in\nlarge-scale distributed computing systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2014 18:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-07"}

A perturbative\nargument is then given to show how to obtain regularity for solutions to an\nequation with variable coefficients and smooth interface. Throughout, we pay\nspecial attention to a nonlinear version of the problem with a drift given by a\nsingular integral operator of the solution, which has an interpretation in the\ncontext of quasigeostrophic dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2014 19:50:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2015 19:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Based on dimensional\nanalysis (Pi theorem), it is shown that any properly scaled statistics of the\nsmall-scale turbulence are universal functions of a stability parameter defined\nas the ratio of a reference height z and the Dougherty-Ozmidov length scale\nwhich in the limit of z-less stratification is linearly proportional to the\nObukhov length scale. Measurements of atmospheric turbulence made at five\nlevels on a 20-m tower over the Arctic pack ice during the Surface Heat Budget\nof the Arctic Ocean experiment (SHEBA) are used to examine the behaviour of\ndifferent similarity functions in the stable boundary layer. It is found that\nin the framework of this approach the non-dimensional turbulent viscosity is\nequal to the gradient Richardson number whereas the non-dimensional turbulent\nthermal diffusivity is equal to the flux Richardson number. These results are a\nconsequence of the approximate local balance between production of turbulence\nby the mean flow shear and viscous dissipation. The turbulence framework based\non the Brunt-Vaisala frequency and the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic\nenergy may have practical advantages for estimating turbulence when the fluxes\nare not directly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2014 21:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-25"}

We consider two competing firms in a market\nproviding two substitutable products with preset qualities. Agents choose their\nconsumptions following a myopic best response dynamics which results in a\nlocal, linear update for the consumptions. At some point in time, firms receive\na limited budget which they can use to trigger a larger consumption of their\nproducts in the network. Firms have to decide between marginally improving the\nquality of their products and giving free offers to a chosen set of agents in\nthe network in order to better facilitate spreading their products. We derive a\nsimple threshold rule for the optimal allocation of the budget and describe the\nresulting Nash equilibrium. It is shown that the optimal allocation of the\nbudget depends on the entire distribution of centralities in the network,\nquality of products and the model parameters. In particular, we show that in a\ngraph with a higher number of agents with centralities above a certain\nthreshold, firms spend more budget on seeding in the optimal allocation.\nFurthermore, if seeding budget is nonzero for a balanced graph, it will also be\nnonzero for any other graph, and if seeding budget is zero for a star graph, it\nwill be zero for any other graph too. We also show that firms allocate more\nbudget to quality improvement when their qualities are close, in order to\ndistance themselves from the rival firm. However, as the gap between qualities\nwidens, competition in qualities becomes less effective and firms spend more\nbudget on seeding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2014 22:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-08"}

The problem mixes combinatorial optimization to select and order the\ndebris among a list of candidates, and continuous optimization to fix the\nrendezvous dates and to define the minimum fuel orbital maneuvers. The solution\nmethod proposed consists in three stages. Firstly the orbital transfer problem\nis simplified by considering a generic transfer strategy suited either to a\nhigh thrust or a low thrust vehicle. A response surface modelling is built by\nsolving the reduced problem for all pairs of debris and for discretized dates,\nand storing the results in cost matrices. Secondly a simulated annealing\nalgorithm is applied to find the optimal mission planning. The cost function is\nassessed by interpolation on the response surface based on the cost matrices.\nThis allows the convergence of the simulated algorithm in a limited computation\ntime, yielding an optimal mission planning. Thirdly the successive missions are\nre-optimized in terms of transfer maneuvers and dates without changing the\ndebris order.

More than 20 years later, the state of\nthe art algorithms for most variants still take time more than O(n^2 / log n),\nbut no matching lower bounds are known, not even under reasonable complexity\ntheoretic assumptions.\n  To obtain a conditional lower bound, in this paper we assume the Strong\nExponential Time Hypothesis or, more precisely, that there is no\nO*((2-delta)^N) algorithm for CNF-SAT for any delta > 0. Under this assumption\nwe show that the Frechet distance cannot be computed in strongly subquadratic\ntime, i.e., in time O(n^{2-delta}) for any delta > 0.

How do these induced heterogeneities differ in the saturation regime\nand in the linear response regime ? Is there a maximum of the heterogeneous\nmotion versus isomerization rate and why ? Are the heterogeneity evolution with\nthe isomerization rate connected with the diffusion or relaxation time\nevolution ? We use out of equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to answer\nthese questions. We find that the heterogeneity increases in the linear\nresponse regime for large isomerization periods and small perturbations. In\ncontrast the heterogeneity decreases in the saturation regime, i.e. when the\nisomerization half-period ($\\tau_{p}/2$) is smaller than the relaxation time of\nthe material ($\\tau_{\\alpha}$). This result makes possible a test of the effect\nof cooperative motions on the dynamics using the chromophores as Maxwell demons\nthat destroy or stimulate the cooperative motions. Because the heterogeneities\nincrease in the linear regime and then decrease in the saturation regime, we\nfind a maximum for $\\tau_{p}/2 \\approx \\tau_{\\alpha}$. The induced excitations\nconcentration follows a power law evolution versus the isomerization rate and\nthen saturates. As a consequence the $\\alpha$ relaxation time is related to the\nexcitation concentration with a power law, a result in qualitative agreement\nwith recent findings in constrained models.

The most critical requirement\nfor widespread sensor networks is power efficiency since battery replacement is\nnot viable. Many protocols are proposed to minimize the power consumption by\nusing complex algorithms. However, it is difficult to perform these complex\nmethods since an individual sensor node in sensor networks does not have high\ncomputational capacity. On the other hand, many sensor nodes should transfer\nthe data packet to the sink node that collects the required data. Therefore,\nthe operations of the sensor nodes over the route are terminated. It is\ndifficult to deliver the data packet to the sink node even if some sensor nodes\nare active. In this paper, an introduction of WSNs is presented with a deep\ninsight into the power-aware routing protocol for sensor networks. The\nprotocols considered are LEACH,VGA and PEGASIS.

The\nsingle-snapshot measurement data is turned into a Hankel data matrix which\nadmits the Vandermonde decomposition and is suitable for the MUSIC algorithm.\nThe MUSIC algorithm amounts to finding the null space (the noise space) of the\nHankel matrix, forming the noise-space correlation function and identifying the\ns smallest local minima of the noise-space correlation as the frequency set.\n  In the noise-free case exact reconstruction is guaranteed for any arbitrary\nset of frequencies as long as the number of measurements is at least twice the\nnumber of distinct frequencies to be recovered. In the presence of noise the\nstability analysis shows that the perturbation of the noise-space correlation\nis proportional to the spectral norm of the noise matrix as long as the latter\nis smaller than the smallest (nonzero) singular value of the noiseless Hankel\ndata matrix. Under the assumption that frequencies are separated by at least\ntwice the Rayleigh Length (RL), the stability of the noise-space correlation is\nproved by means of novel discrete Ingham inequalities which provide bounds on\nnonzero singular values of the noiseless Hankel data matrix.\n  The numerical performance of MUSIC is tested in comparison with other\nalgorithms such as BLO-OMP and SDP (TV-min). While BLO-OMP is the stablest\nalgorithm for frequencies separated above 4 RL, MUSIC becomes the best\nperforming one for frequencies separated between 2 RL and 3 RL. Also, MUSIC is\nmore efficient than other methods. MUSIC truly shines when the frequency\nseparation drops to 1 RL or below when all other methods fail. Indeed, the\nresolution length of MUSIC decreases to zero as noise decreases to zero as a\npower law with an exponent much smaller than an upper bound established by\nDonoho.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Apr 2014 15:51:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Sep 2014 21:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-23"}

Many of the tools\nnecessary to make this information system a reality will require much more than\nindexing and will instead depend on community input paired with machine\nlearning, where mathematicians' expertise can fill the gaps of automatization.\nThis report proposes the establishment of an organization; the development of a\nset of platforms, tools, and services; the deployment of an ongoing applied\nresearch program to complement the development work; and the mobilization and\ncoordination of the mathematical community to take the first steps toward these\ncapabilities. The report recommends building on the extensive work done by many\ndedicated individuals under the rubric of the World Digital Mathematical\nLibrary, as well as many other community initiatives. Developing a 21st Century\nGlobal Library for Mathematics envisions a combination of machine learning\nmethods and community-based editorial effort that makes a significantly greater\nportion of the information and knowledge in the global mathematical corpus\navailable to researchers as linked open data through a central organizational\nentity-referred to in the report as the Digital Mathematics Library.
