Many interesting\nsemantics have been proposed. Brewka and Eiter's Principle I expresses the\nbasic intuition behind the preferences. All the approaches that satisfy\nPrinciple I introduce a rather imperative feature into otherwise declarative\nlanguage. They understand preferences as the order, in which the rules of a\nprogram have to be applied. In this paper we present two purely declarative\napproaches for preference handling that satisfy Principle I, and work for\ngeneral conflicts, including direct and indirect conflicts between rules. The\nfirst approach is based on the idea that a rule cannot be defeated by a less\npreferred conflicting rule. This approach is able to ignore preferences between\nnon-conflicting rules, and, for instance, is equivalent with the answer set\nsemantics for the subclass of stratified programs. It is suitable for the\nscenarios, when developers do not have full control over preferences. The\nsecond approach relaxes the requirement for ignoring conflicting rules, which\nensures that it stays in the NP complexity class. It is based on the idea that\na rule cannot be defeated by a rule that is less preferred or depends on a less\npreferred rule. The second approach can be also characterized by a\ntransformation to logic programs without preferences. It turns out that the\napproaches form a hierarchy, a branch in the hierarchy of the approaches by\nDelgrande et. al., Wang et. al., and Brewka and Eiter. Finally, we show an\napplication for which the existing approaches are not usable, and the\napproaches of this paper produce expected results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Apr 2014 16:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-29"}

The major obstacle on this\nroute comes from the fact that the SO interaction can also polarize the\nelectron system and produce additional contributions to the perturbation\ntheory, arising from the electron-electron interactions. In electronic\nstructure calculations, it may even lead to necessity to abandon the\nperturbation theory and return to the self-consistently solution of\nKohn-Sham-like equations with the effective potential $\\hat{v}$, incorporating\nthe effects of the electron-electron interactions and the SO coupling, even\nthough the latter is small. In this work, we present the theory of\nself-consistent linear response (SCLR), which allows us to get rid of numerical\nself-consistency and formulate it analytically in the first order of the SO\ncoupling. This strategy is applied to the Hartree-Fock solution of the\neffective Hubbard model, derived from electronic structure calculations in the\nWannier basis. By using $\\hat{v}$, obtained from SCLR, one can successfully\nreproduce results of ordinary calculations for the orbital magnetization and\nother properties in the first order of the SO coupling. Particularly, SCLR\nappears to be extremely useful for calculations of antisymmetric\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions based on the magnetic force theorem.\nFurthermore, due to the powerful 2n+1 theorem, the SCLR theory allows us to\ncalculate the magnetic anisotropy energy up to the third order of the SO\ncoupling. The fruitfulness of this approach is illustrated on a number of\nexample, including the spin canting in YTiO$_3$ and LaMnO$_3$, formation of\nspiral magnetic order in BiFeO$_3$, and the magnetic inversion symmetry\nbreaking in BiMnO$_3$, which gives rise to both ferroelectric activity and DM\ninteractions, responsible for the ferromagnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 06:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

With recent studies\nidentifying a double subgiant branch in M2 and a dispersion in Sr and Ba\nabundances, our spectroscopic analysis confirms that this globular cluster has\nexperienced a complex formation history with similarities to M22, NGC 1851 and\nomega Centauri.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 06:06:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

A naive approach to coping with\nhigh-dimensionality is to first perform dimensionality reduction (DR) and then\nexecute CDE. However, such a two-step process does not perform well in practice\nbecause the error incurred in the first DR step can be magnified in the second\nCDE step. In this paper, we propose a novel single-shot procedure that performs\nCDE and DR simultaneously in an integrated way. Our key idea is to formulate DR\nas the problem of minimizing a squared-loss variant of conditional entropy, and\nthis is solved via CDE. Thus, an additional CDE step is not needed after DR.

When applied\nto spins, AC produces ensembles of highly polarized spins, which enhance the\nsignal strength in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). According to this cooling\napproach, spin-half nuclei in a constant magnetic field are considered as bits,\nor more precisely, quantum bits, in a known probability distribution.\nAlgorithmic steps on these bits are then translated into specially designed NMR\npulse sequences using common NMR quantum computation tools. The $algorithmic$\ncooling of spins is achieved by alternately combining reversible,\nentropy-preserving manipulations (borrowed from data compression algorithms)\nwith $selective$ $reset$, the transfer of entropy from selected spins to the\nenvironment. In theory, applying algorithmic cooling to sufficiently large spin\nsystems may produce polarizations far beyond the limits due to conservation of\nShannon entropy.\n  Here, only selective reset steps are performed, hence we prefer to call this\nprocess \"heat-bath\" cooling, rather than algorithmic cooling. We experimentally\nimplement here two consecutive steps of selective reset that transfer entropy\nfrom two selected spins to the environment. We performed such cooling\nexperiments with commercially-available labeled molecules, on standard\nliquid-state NMR spectrometers. Our experiments yielded polarizations that\n$bypass$ $Shannon's$ $entropy$-$conservation$ $bound$, so that the entire\nspin-system was cooled.

It is still\nunclear how the collimated jets of relativistic plasma on hundreds to thousands\nof kpc scale form, and why nearly always they are launched from the nuclei of\nbulge dominated elliptical galaxies and not flat spirals. Here we present the\ndiscovery of giant radio source J2345-0449 (z=0.0755), a clear and extremely\nrare counter example where relativistic jets are ejected from a luminous and\nmassive spiral galaxy on scale of ~1.6 Mpc, the largest known so far. Extreme\nphysical properties observed for this bulgeless spiral host, such as its high\noptical and infra-red luminosity, large dynamical mass, rapid disk rotation,\nand episodic jet activity are possibly the results of its unusual formation\nhistory, which has also assembled, via gas accretion from a disk, its central\nblack hole of mass >2 x 10^8 M_sun. The very high mid-IR luminosity of the\ngalaxy suggests that it is actively forming stars and still building a massive\ndisk. We argue that the launch of these powerful jets is facilitated by an\nadvection dominated, magnetized accretion flow at low Eddington rate onto this\nunusually massive (for a bulgeless disk galaxy) and possibly fast-spinning\ncentral black hole. Therefore, J2345-0449 is an extremely rare, unusual\ngalactic system whose properties challenge the standard paradigms for black\nhole growth and formation of relativistic jets in disk galaxies. Thus, it\nprovides fundamental insight into accretion disk -- relativistic jet coupling\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 07:51:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 02:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The main motivation of both approaches is identical, to handle\nanisotropic problems efficiently. However, in our approach the basis set is\ndefined as the eigenfunctions of a differential operator and several desirable\nproperties are introduced by construction. The method demonstrates very robust\nin handling problems with any crystal structure or topology of the Fermi\nsurface, and the periodicity of the reciprocal space is treated as a boundary\ncondition for our Helmholtz equation. We illustrate the method by analysing the\nfree-electron-like Lithium (Li), Sodium (Na), Copper (Cu), Lead(Pb), Tungsten\n(W) and Magnesium diboride (MgB2).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:14:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 10:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-11"}

Both MT and COL-BSSs should rotate fast,but braking mechanisms may\nintervene with efficiencies and time-scales unknown,thus preventing a clear\nprediction of the expected rotational velocities. In this context,an extensive\nsurvey is ongoing by using FLAMES@VLT, with the aim to obtain abundance\npatterns and rotational velocities for representative samples of BSSs in\nGalactic GCs.A sub-population of CO-depleted BSSs has been identified in 47\nTuc,with only one fast rotating star detected (Ferraro et al.2006).

One of the main ideas behind\nexact approximations consists of replacing intractable quantities required to\nrun standard MCMC algorithms, such as the target probability density in a\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm, with estimators. Perhaps surprisingly, such\napproximations lead to powerful algorithms which are exact in the sense that\nthey are guaranteed to have correct limiting distributions. In this paper we\ndiscover a general framework which allows one to compare, or order, performance\nmeasures of two implementations of such algorithms. In particular, we establish\nan order with respect to the mean acceptance probability, the first\nautocorrelation coefficient, the asymptotic variance and the right spectral\ngap. The key notion to guarantee the ordering is that of the convex order\nbetween estimators used to implement the algorithms. We believe that our convex\norder condition is close to optimal, and this is supported by a counter-example\nwhich shows that a weaker variance order is not sufficient. The convex order\nplays a central role by allowing us to construct a martingale coupling which\nenables the comparison of performance measures of Markov chain with differing\ninvariant distributions, contrary to existing results. We detail applications\nof our result by identifying extremal distributions within given classes of\napproximations, by showing that averaging replicas improves performance in a\nmonotonic fashion and that stratification is guaranteed to improve performance\nfor the standard implementation of the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)\nMCMC method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 09:45:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 09:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-30"}

For sufficiently strong feedback, as assumed in\nour models, a moderate amount of merging does not seem to be a problem for the\nz=0 disc galaxy population, but may rather be a requirement. The average\nprofiles of simulated disc galaxies agree with observations at z>=1.5. At z<=1,\nthere is too much growth in size and too little growth in central mass,\npossibly due to the under-abundance of bars. The discrepancies may partly be\ncaused by differences between the star formation histories of the simulations\nand those assumed for observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 10:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-29"}

Although several different mechanisms that may drive these jets\nhave been proposed over the last decades, the origin of the zonal winds is\nstill unclear. Here, we explore the possibility that the interplay of planetary\nrotation with the compression and expansion of the convecting fluid can drive\nmultiple deep zonal jets by a compressional Rhines-type mechanism, as\noriginally proposed by Ingersoll and Pollard (1982). In a certain limit, this\ndeep mechanism is shown to be mathematically analogous to the classical Rhines\nmechanism possibly operating at cloud level. Jets are predicted to occur on a\ncompressional Rhines length $l_R = (2 \\Omega \\langle H_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle\nv_{jet}^{-1} )^{-1/2}$, where $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity, $\\langle\nH_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle$ is the mean inverse density scale height and $v_{jet}$ is\nthe typical jet velocity. Two-dimensional numerical simulations using the\nanelastic approximation reveal that this mechanism robustly generates jets of\nthe predicted width, and that it typically dominates the dynamics in systems\ndeeper than $O(l_R)$. Potential vorticity staircases are observed to form\nspontaneously and are typically accompanied by unstably stratified buoyancy\nstaircases. The mechanism only operates at large rotation rates, exceeding\nthose typically reached in three-dimensional simulations of deep convection in\nspherical shells. Applied to Jupiter and Saturn, the compressional Rhines\nscaling reasonably fits the available observations. Interestingly, even weak\nvertical density variations such as those in the Earth core can give rise to a\nlarge number of jets, leading to fundamentally different flow structures than\npredicted by the Boussinesq models typically used in this context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 11:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In the considered scenario, a BS\n$B$ transmits to a user $U$, while there are $N_M$ Machine-Type Devices (MTDs)\nattached to $U$, all sending simultaneously to $U$ and each using the same rate\n$R_M$. While assuming that $B$ knows the channel $B-U$, but not the interfering\nchannels from the MTDs to $U$, we prove that there is a positive downlink rate\nthat can always be decoded by $U$, leading to zero-outage of the downlink\nsignal. This is a rather surprising consequence of the features of the multiple\naccess channel and the fixed rate $R_M$. We also consider the case of a\nsimpler, single-user decoder at $U$ with successive interference cancellation.\nHowever, with single-user decoder, a positive zero-outage rate exists only when\n$N_M=1$ and is zero when $N_M>1$. This implies that joint decoding is\ninstrumental in enabling fixed-rate underlay operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 12:06:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 11:33:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 14:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-31"}

We study, from a theoretical point of\nview, the impact of axial rotation of stars on various observed properties of\nsingle-aged stellar populations: magnitude at the turnoff, photometric\nproperties of evolved stars, surface velocities, surface abundances, and the\nimpact of rotation on the age determination of clusters by an isochrone\nfitting. Stellar models for different initial masses, metallicities, and\nzero-age main sequence (ZAMS) rotational velocities are used for building\ninterpolated stellar tracks, isochrones, and synthetic clusters for various\nages and metallicities. The synthetic populations account for the effects of\nthe initial distribution of the rotational velocities on the ZAMS, the impact\nof the inclination angle and the effects of gravity and limb darkening,\nunresolved binaries and photometric errors. Interpolated tracks, isochrones,\nand synthetic clusters can be computed through a public web interface. For\nclusters with a metallicity in the range [0.002, 0.014] and an age between 30\nMyr and 1 Gyr, the fraction of fast rotators on the main sequence (MS) band is\nthe largest just below the turnoff. This is a natural consequence of the\nincrease in the MS lifetime due to rotation. The fraction of fast rotators one\nmagnitude below the turnoff also increases with the age of the cluster between\n30 Myr and 1 Gyr. There is an increase in the fraction of enriched stars when\nthe metallicity decreases. We show that the use of isochrones computed from\nrotating stellar models with an initial rotation that is representative of the\naverage initial rotation of the stars in clusters provides a reasonable\nestimate of the age, even though stars in a real cluster did not start their\nevolution with an identical initial rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 12:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-04"}

It is well known that structures arising in the gaseous\ncomponent of the disc due to a gravitational instability can have a significant\neffect on the evolution of dust particles. Previous results have shown that\nspiral density waves can be highly efficient at collecting dust particles,\ncreating significant local over-densities of particles. The degree of such\nconcentrations has been shown to be dependent on two parameters: the size of\nthe dust particles and the rate of gas cooling. We expand on these findings,\nincluding the self-gravity of dust particles, to see how these particle\nover-densities evolve. We use the PENCIL CODE to solve the local shearing sheet\nequations for gas on a fixed grid together with the equations of motion for\nsolids coupled to the gas through an aerodynamic drag force. We find that the\nenhancements in the surface density of particles in spiral density wave crests\ncan reach levels high enough to allow the solid component of the disc to\ncollapse under its own self-gravity. This produces many gravitationally bound\ncollections of particles within the spiral structure. The total mass contained\nin bound structures appears nearly independent of the cooling time, suggesting\nthat the formation of planetesimals through dust particle trapping by\nself-gravitating density waves may be possible at a larger range of radii\nwithin a disc than previously thought. So, density waves due to gravitational\ninstabilities in the early stages of star formation may provide excellent sites\nfor the rapid formation of many large, planetesimal-sized objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 12:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We give two satisfiability\npreserving reductions from $\\mathsf{PMTL}$ to the decidable logic\n$\\mathsf{MTL}[\\until_I]$. The first reduction uses simple projections, while\nthe second reduction uses a novel technique of temporal projections with\noversampling. We study the trade-off between the two reductions: while the\nsecond reduction allows the introduction of extra action points in the\nunderlying model, the equisatisfiable $\\mathsf{MTL}[\\until_I]$ formula obtained\nis exponentially succinct than the one obtained via the first reduction, where\nno oversampling of the underlying model is needed. We also show that\n$\\mathsf{PMTL}$ is strictly more expressive than the fragments\n$\\mathsf{MTL}[\\until_I,\\since]$ and $\\mathsf{MTL}[\\until,\\since_I]$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 13:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-29"}

The level of X-ray emission from BD+37\n442 could be explained by accretion from the sdO wind by a neutron star\norbiting at a period of less than ten days.

The Schroedinger picture is interesting because it is well\nsuited to explore properties of the vacuum state in the non-perturbative\nregime. Yet, not much analytical work has been done on this subject, and even\nthe topic of perturbation theory in the Schroedinger representation is not well\ndeveloped, especially in the case of gauge theories. In a paper by Hatfield\n[Phys.Lett.B 147, 435 (1984)] the vacuum wave functional for SU(2) theory was\ncomputed to O(e). In the non-perturbative regime, the most sophisticated\nanalytical approach has been developed by Karabali et al. in a series of papers\n(see [Nucl.Phys.B 824, 387 (2010)] and references therein). This thesis aims to\nput perturbation theory in the Schroedinger representation on more solid ground\nby computing the vacuum wave functional for a general gauge group SU$(N_c)$ up\nto O$(e^2)$, utilizing modifications of these two methods. This is important\nsince it provides us with a tool for testing non-perturbative approaches, which\nshould reproduce the perturbative result in an appropriate limit.\n  Furthermore, regularization and renormalization are also not well understood\nin the Schroedinger picture. The regularization method proposed by Karabali et\nal. leads to conflicting results when applied to the computation of the vacuum\nwave functional with the two different methods mentioned above. We aim to\nclarify how regularization should be implemented and develop a new\nregularization approach, which brings these two expressions into agreement,\nproviding a strong check of the regularization employed. We argue that this\nregularization procedure is not specific to the cases studied here.

To this purpose, from\nVLA-COSMOS we considered the 1537, F[1.4 GHz]>0.06 mJy sources with a reliable\nredshift estimate, and sub-divided them into star-forming galaxies and AGN\nsolely on the basis of their radio luminosity. The AGN sample is complete with\nrespect to radio selection at all z<~3.5. 832 radio sources have a counterpart\nin the PEP catalogue. 175 are AGN. Their redshift distribution closely\nresembles that of the total radio-selected AGN population, and exhibits two\nmarked peaks at z~0.9 and z~2.5. We find that the probability for a\nradio-selected AGN to be detected at FIR wavelengths is both a function of\nradio power and redshift, whereby powerful sources are more likely to be FIR\nemitters at earlier epochs. This is due to two distinct effects: 1) at all\nradio luminosities, FIR activity monotonically increases with look-back time\nand 2) radio activity of AGN origin is increasingly less effective at\ninhibiting FIR emission. Radio-selected AGN with FIR emission are\npreferentially located in galaxies which are smaller than those hosting\nFIR-inactive sources. Furthermore, at all z<~2, there seems to be a\npreferential (stellar) mass scale M ~[10^{10}-10^{11}] Msun which maximizes the\nchances for FIR emission. We find such FIR (and MIR) emission to be due to\nprocesses indistinguishable from those which power star-forming galaxies. It\nfollows that radio emission in at least 35% of the entire AGN population is the\nsum of two contributions: AGN accretion and star-forming processes within the\nhost galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 14:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We conclude that the difference between\n$T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ values derived from NLTE and LTE modelling is relatively\ninsensitive to the degree of the horizontal inhomogeneity of the star being\nmodeled, and largely depends on the observable quantity being fit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 15:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-07"}
