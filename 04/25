Most important of them is the invariance\nof entanglement under local unitary operations. We show that this is no longer\ntrue with local ${\\cal {PT}}$ symmetric unitary operations. If two parties\nshare a maximally entangled state, then under local ${\\cal {PT}}$ symmetric\nunitary evolution the entropy of entanglement for pure bipartite states does\nnot remain invariant. Furthermore, we show that if one of the party has access\nto ${\\cal {PT}}$-symmetric quantum world, then a maximally entangled state in\nusual quantum theory appears as a non-maximally entangled states for the other\nparty.

In a computer simulation, the\npresence of such ice nucleating agents does not necessarily alleviate the\ndifficulties associated with forming ice on accessible timescales.\nNevertheless, in this work we present results from molecular dynamics\nsimulations in which we systematically compare homogeneous and heterogeneous\nice nucleation, using the atmospherically important clay mineral kaolinite as\nour model ice nucleating agent. From our simulations, we do indeed find that\nkaolinite is an excellent ice nucleating agent but that contrary to\nconventional thought, non-basal faces of ice can nucleate at the basal face of\nkaolinite. We see that in the liquid phase, the kaolinite surface has a drastic\neffect on the density profile of water, with water forming a dense, tightly\nbound first contact layer. Monitoring the time evolution of the water density\nreveals that changes away from the interface may play an important role in the\nnucleation mechanism. The findings from this work suggest that heterogeneous\nice nucleating agents may not only enhance the ice nucleation rate, but also\nalter the macroscopic structure of the ice crystals that form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 16:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-25"}

However,\nthis model does not apply when differential rotation is strong with respect to\nstable thermal stratification or when chemical stratification has a significant\ndynamical effect, a situation encountered at the outer boundary of\nnuclear-burning convective cores.

These are supported on the solutions to\nthe scattering equations refined according to MHV degree and can be checked by\ncomparison with corresponding formulae of Witten and of Cachazo and Skinner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 18:39:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Oct 2014 21:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

The proposed MEIO modeling approach\ncan be seen as a realization of the Everybody-in-the-Loop (EitL) framework,\nwhich promotes a sustainable future using behaviors and actions that are aware\nof their ubiquitous eco-socio-environment impacts. In this vision, the\nbehavioral changes could be initiated by providing all actors with their\nfootprint statement, which would be estimated using the MEIO models. First, a\nnaive MEIO model is proposed in the form of a graph of actions and\nresponsibility by considering interactions and goods transfers among the\nentities and actors along four channels. Then, the unnormalized responsibility\nand also the final responsibility among the actors are introduced, and then are\nused to re-allocate immediate footprint of actors among themselves. The\nfootprint in the current model is limited to three major impacts: Water,\nEnergy, and GHG emissions.

The E-perspective modeling approach\nparticularly allows estimating the footprint associated to a specific end user.\nIn two use cases from the auto and Telco industries, it has been observed that\nthe proposed MEIO models are practical and dependable in allocating footprint\nto the provider and also to the end user, while i) avoiding footprint leakage\nto the end users and ii) handling the large numbers end users.

We argue that when\nthe large-field and low-energy regimes coincide the scalar dynamics is most\neffectively described in terms of an asymptotic large-field expansion whose\nform can be dictated by approximate symmetries, which also help control the\nsize of quantum corrections. We discuss several possible symmetries that can\nachieve this, including pseudo-Goldstone inflatons characterized by a coset\n$G/H$ (based on abelian and non-abelian, compact and non-compact symmetries),\nas well as symmetries that are intrinsically higher dimensional. Besides the\nusual trigonometric potentials of Natural Inflation we also find in this way\nsimple {\\em large-field} power laws (like $V \\propto \\phi^2$) and exponential\npotentials, $V(\\phi) = \\sum_{k} V_k \\; e^{-k \\phi/M}$.

We divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20\nclusters based on redshift and central density, performing an X-ray fit to all\nclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of the\ntemperature profile. This approach allows us to constrain the shape of the\ntemperature profile over 0<r<1.5R500, which would be impossible on a\nper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, on\naverage, 2000 X-ray counts. The results presented here represent the first\nconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 to\nz=1.2. We find that high-z (0.6<z<1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler both\nin the inner (r<0.1R500) and outer (r>R500) regions than their low-z\n(0.3<z<0.6) counterparts. Combining the average temperature profile with\nmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the average\npressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. Overall, our observed\npressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,\nsuggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of the\ncore. We find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile at\nr<0.7R500. We observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r>R500 in\nour high-z subsample. This flattening is consistent with a temperature bias due\nto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 keV) halos, which would go\nundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1.

In contrast, the\nconventional picture of satellite galaxies has them methodically turning a\nlarge gas reservoir into stars until this reservoir is forcibly removed due to\nexternal ram pressure. This picture needs revision. Our modern understanding of\nthe baryon cycle suggests that in some regimes the simple interruption of the\nfresh gas supply may quench satellite galaxies long before stripping events\noccur, a process we call overconsumption. We compile measurements from the\nliterature of observed satellite quenching times at a range of redshifts to\ndetermine if satellites are principally quenched through orbit-based gas\nstripping events -- either direct stripping of the disk (ram pressure\nstripping) or the extended gas halo (strangulation) -- or from\ninternally-driven star formation outflows via overconsumption. The observed\ntimescales show significant deviation from the evolution expected for gas\nstripping mechanisms and suggest that either ram pressure stripping is much\nmore efficient at high redshift, or that secular outflows quench satellites\nbefore orbit-based stripping occurs.

Although metric learning has been well\nstudied in the past decades, most existing algorithms are impractical to handle\nlarge-scale data sets. In this paper, we present an image similarity learning\nmethod that can scale well in both the number of images and the dimensionality\nof image descriptors. To this end, similarity comparison is restricted to each\nsample's local neighbors and a discriminative similarity measure is induced\nfrom large margin neighborhood embedding. We also exploit the ensemble of\nprojections so that high-dimensional features can be processed in a set of\nlower-dimensional subspaces in parallel without much performance compromise.\nThe similarity function is learned online using a stochastic gradient descent\nalgorithm in which the triplet sampling strategy is customized for quick\nconvergence of classification performance.

In practice, the spin signal is fitted to the analytic\nsolution of the spin Bloch equation, which accounts for diffusion, relaxation\nand precession effects on spin. The analytic formula, however, is derived for\nan infinite length of the 1D spin channel. This is usually not satisfied in the\nreal devices. The finite size of the channel length $l_{\\text{dev}}$ leads to\nconfinement of spins and increase of spin accumulation. Moreover, reflection of\nspins from the channel ends leads to spin interference, altering the\ncharacteristic precession lineshape. In this work we study the influence of\nfinite $l_{\\text{dev}}$ on the Hanle lineshape and show when it can lead to a\ntwo-fold discrepancy in the extracted spin coefficients. We propose the\nextension of the Hanle analytic formula to include the geometrical aspects of\nthe real device and get an excellent agreement with a finite-element model of\nspin precession, where this geometry is explicitly set.

The large scale of the data\noften results in challenging high-dimensional estimation problems where only a\nminority of the data shows specific grouping patterns. To address these\nemerging challenges, we develop a new clustering methodology that introduces\nthe idea of a regularization path into unsupervised learning. A regularization\npath for a clustering problem is created by varying the degree of sparsity\nconstraint that is imposed on the differences between objects via the minimax\nconcave penalty with adaptive tuning parameters. Instead of providing a single\nsolution represented by a cluster assignment for each object, the method\nproduces a short sequence of solutions that determines not only the cluster\nassignment but also a corresponding number of clusters for each solution. The\noptimization of the penalized loss function is carried out through an MM\nalgorithm with block coordinate descent. The advantages of this clustering\nalgorithm compared to other existing methods are as follows: it does not\nrequire the input of the number of clusters; it is capable of simultaneously\nseparating irrelevant or noisy observations that show no grouping pattern,\nwhich can greatly improve data interpretation; it is a general methodology that\ncan be applied to many clustering problems. We test this method on various\nsimulated datasets and on gene expression data, where it shows better or\ncompetitive performance compared against several clustering methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 23:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-09"}

Here, we\nanalytically investigate the transition from a fully ionized envelope to a\npartially recombined one and its effects on the SN light curve. The motivation\nis to establish the underlying processes which dominate the evolution at late\ntimes when recombination takes place in the envelope, yet early enough so that\n$^{56}$Ni decay is a negligible source of energy. We assume a simple, yet\nadequate, hydrodynamic profile of the envelope and study the mechanisms which\ndominate the energy emission and the observed temperature. We consider the\ndiffusion of photons through the envelope while analyzing the ionization\nfraction and the coupling between radiation and gas. We find that once\nrecombination starts, the observed temperature decreases slowly in time.\nHowever, in a typical red supergiant (RSG) explosion, the recombination wave\ndoes not affect the bolometric luminosity immediately. Only at later times, the\ncooling wave may reach layers that are deep enough to affect the luminosity. We\nfind that the plateau is not a generic result of a recombination process in\nexpanding gas. Instead it depends on the density profile of the parts of the\nenvelope which undergo recombination. Our results are useful to investigate the\nlight curves of RSG explosions. We show the resulting light curves of two\nexamples of RSG explosions according to our model and discuss their\ncompatibility with observations.

In this paper a phase field type of continuum\ntheory of the time evolution of an ensemble of parallel edge dislocations with\nidentical Burgers vectors, corresponding to the dislocation geometry near\nboundaries, is presented. Since the dislocation-dislocation interaction is\nscale free ($1/r$), apart from the average dislocation spacing the theory\ncannot contain any length scale parameter.

When pair tunneling is strong enough, the ground state wavefunction\npredicted by the MFT is complex and doubly degenerate while the quantum ground\nstate wavefunction is always real and unique. The time reversal symmetry is\nspontaneously broken when the system transfers from the quantum ground state\ninto one of the mean field ground states upon a small perturbation. As the gap\nbetween the lowest two levels decreases exponentially with particle number, the\nrequired perturbation inducing the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is\ninfinitesimal for particle number of typical cold atom systems. The quantum\nground state is further analyzed with the Penrose-Onsager criterion, and is\nfound to be a fragmented condensate. The state also develops the pair\ncorrelation and has non-vanishing pair order parameter instead of the\nconventional single particle order parameter. When this model is generalized to\noptical lattice, a pair superfluid can be generated. The mean field ground\nstate can be regarded as effective ground state in this simple model. The\ndetailed computation for this model enables us to offer an in-depth discussion\nof the relation between SSB and effective ground state, giving a glimpse on how\nnonlinearity arises in the SSB of a quantum system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 08:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

The Bloecker tracks with the cluster IFMR result in ages, which\nare unexpectedly young. We find that the Bloecker post-AGB tracks need to be\naccelerated by a factor of three to fit the local white dwarf masses. This\nacceleration extends the age distribution. We adjust the IFMR as a free\nparameter to map the central star ages on the full age range of bulge stellar\npopulations. This fit requires a steeper IFMR than the cluster relation. We\nfind a star-formation rate in the Galactic bulge, which is approximately\nconstant between 3 and 10 Gyr ago. The result indicates that planetary nebulae\nare mainly associated with the younger and more metal-rich bulge populations.\nThe constant rate of star-formation between 3 and 10 Gyr agrees with\nsuggestions that the metal-rich component of the bulge is formed during an\nextended process, such as a bar interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 08:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

To\nthat end, we consider in-plane optical phonon modes with wavevectors close to\nthe $\\Gamma$ point as well as to the $K, -K$ points and calculate the effective\nphonon-mediated electron-electron interaction by integrating out the phonon\nmodes. Ordering tendencies are studied by means of a momentum-resolved\nfunctional renormalization group approach allowing for an unbiased\ninvestigation of the appearing instabilities. In the case of an exclusive and\nsupercritical phonon-mediated interaction, we find a Kekul\\'e and a nematic\nbond ordering tendency being favored over the $s$-wave superconducting state.\nThe competition between the different phonon-induced orderings clearly shows a\nrepulsive interaction between phonons at small and large wavevector transfers.\nWe further discuss the influence of phonon-mediated interactions on\nelectronically-driven instabilities induced by onsite, nearest neighbor and\nnext-to-nearest neighbor density-density interactions. We find an extension of\nthe parameter regime of the spin density wave order going along with an\nincrease of the critical scales where ordering occurs, and a suppression of\ncompeting orders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 10:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

The detection\nof source at very high energy (VHE, $E>100$ GeV) with a differential photon\nspectral index of $2.7\\pm0.3$ and the rapid variability associated with it\nsuggests that the emission arises from a compact region located beyond the\nbroad line emitting region. The plausible $\\gamma$-ray emission mechanism can\nthen be inverse Compton scattering of IR photons from obscuring torus. Further,\nthe decay time of LAT flare cannot be explained by considering simple radiative\nloss mechanisms. Hence, to interpret the LAT light curves, we develop a model\nwhere the broadband emission originates from a compact region, arising\nplausibly from the compression of jet matter at the recollimation zone. The\nflare is then expressed as an outcome of jet deceleration probably associated\nwith this focusing effect. The parameters of the model are further constrained\nby reproducing the broadband spectral energy distribution of the source\nobtained during the flare episode.

In\nits most fundamental form, the phenomenon requires a quantum degenerate Fermi\ngas, a ballistic and adiabatic transport channel, and a constriction with\ndimensions comparable to the Fermi wavelength.

Both current and future photometric surveys are expected to obtain\nimages of billions of distinct galaxies. As a result, storing and analyzing all\nof these PDFs will be non-trivial and even more severe if a survey plans to\ncompute and store multiple different PDFs. In this paper we propose the use of\na sparse basis representation to fully represent individual photo-$z$ PDFs. By\nusing an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm and a combination of Gaussian\nand Voigt basis functions, we demonstrate how our approach is superior to a\nmulti-Gaussian fitting, as we require approximately half of the parameters for\nthe same fitting accuracy with the additional advantage that an entire PDF can\nbe stored by using a 4-byte integer per basis function, and we can achieve\nbetter accuracy by increasing the number of bases. By using data from the\nCFHTLenS, we demonstrate that only ten to twenty points per galaxy are\nsufficient to reconstruct both the individual PDFs and the ensemble redshift\ndistribution, $N(z)$, to an accuracy of 99.9% when compared to the one built\nusing the original PDFs computed with a resolution of $\\delta z = 0.01$,\nreducing the required storage of two hundred original values by a factor of ten\nto twenty. Finally, we demonstrate how this basis representation can be\ndirectly extended to a cosmological analysis, thereby increasing computational\nperformance without losing resolution nor accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 14:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Theories of visual search suggest the existence of a global\nattentional map, computed by integrating bottom-up visual information with\ntop-down, target-specific signals. Where, when and how this integration is\nperformed remains unclear. Here we describe a simple mechanistic model of\nvisual search that is consistent with neurophysiological and neuroanatomical\nconstraints, can localize target objects in complex scenes, and predicts\nsingle-trial human behavior in a search task among complex objects. This model\nposits that target-specific modulation is applied at every point of a\nretinotopic area selective for complex visual features and implements local\nnormalization through divisive inhibition. The combination of multiplicative\nmodulation and divisive normalization creates an attentional map in which\naggregate activity at any location tracks the correlation between input and\ntarget features, with relative and controllable independence from bottom-up\nsaliency. We first show that this model can localize objects in both composite\nimages and natural scenes and demonstrate the importance of normalization for\nsuccessful search. We next show that this model can predict human fixations on\nsingle trials, including error and target-absent trials. We argue that this\nsimple model captures non-trivial properties of the attentional system that\nguides visual search in humans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 15:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-28"}

Finally, we focus on\ninter-arrival times, the most promising parameter for device identification,\nand show its dependency from several device characteristics such as the\nwireless card and driver but also running applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 15:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-28"}

The flux to\na limiting energy of 2.5E-6 kT TNT or 1.05E7 J is 1.03E-7 km-2 hr-1 and the\nflux to a limiting mass of 30 g is 6.14E-10 m-2 yr-1 at the Moon.

Most of the traditional approaches detect events based on fixed\ntemporal and spatial resolutions, while in reality events of different scales\nusually occur simultaneously, namely, they span different intervals in time and\nspace. In this paper, we propose a novel approach towards multiscale event\ndetection using social media data, which takes into account different temporal\nand spatial scales of events in the data. Specifically, we explore the\nproperties of the wavelet transform, which is a well-developed multiscale\ntransform in signal processing, to enable automatic handling of the interaction\nbetween temporal and spatial scales. We then propose a novel algorithm to\ncompute a data similarity graph at appropriate scales and detect events of\ndifferent scales simultaneously by a single graph-based clustering process.\nFurthermore, we present spatiotemporal statistical analysis of the noisy\ninformation present in the data stream, which allows us to define a novel\nterm-filtering procedure for the proposed event detection algorithm and helps\nus study its behavior using simulated noisy data. Experimental results on both\nsynthetically generated data and real world data collected from Twitter\ndemonstrate the meaningfulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
