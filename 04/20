This analysis is of interest as many of today's\napplications require that maximum information and maximum signal power are\nextracted (or transferred) through the circuit at the same time for further\nprocessing so that a compromise concerning the signal spectral shape as well as\nthe matching network has to be found. To this end, the optimization framework\nis applied to a two-port circuit, which is used as an abstraction for a\nbroadband amplifier. Thereby, we characterize the involved Pareto bound by\nconsidering different optimization problems. The first one aims at optimizing\nthe input power spectral density (PSD) as well as the source and load\nadmittances, whereas the second approach assumes the PSD to be fixed and\nuniformly distributed within a fixed bandwidth and optimizes the source and\nload admittances only. Moreover, we will show that additional matching networks\nmay help to improve the trade-off.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Apr 2014 19:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-22"}

Since clouds can exert a\ndominant control on planetary radiation balance, rotation rate could be\ncritical for determining mean planetary climate. Here we investigate this idea\nusing a three-dimensional general circulation model with a sophisticated cloud\nscheme. We find that slowly rotating planets (like Venus) can maintain an\nEarth-like climate at nearly twice the stellar flux as rapidly rotating planets\n(like Earth). This suggests that many exoplanets previously believed to be too\nhot may actually be habitable, depending on their rotation rate. The\nexplanation for this behavior is that slowly rotating planets have a weak\nCoriolis force and long daytime illumination, which promotes strong convergence\nand convection in the substellar region. This produces a large area of\noptically thick clouds, which greatly increases the planetary albedo. In\ncontrast, on rapidly rotating planets a much narrower belt of clouds form in\nthe deep tropics, leading to a relatively low albedo. A particularly striking\nexample of the importance of rotation rate suggested by our simulations is that\na planet with modern Earth's atmosphere, in Venus' orbit, and with modern\nVenus' (slow) rotation rate would be habitable. This would imply that if Venus\nwent through a runaway greenhouse, it had a higher rotation rate at that time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Apr 2014 22:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-29"}

Yet, real auction systems (such as Google AdWords) allow more\nsophisticated constraints on agents' ability to pay, such as \\emph{average\nbudgets}. In this work, we investigate the design of Pareto optimal and\nincentive compatible auctions for agents with \\emph{constrained quasi-linear\nutilities}, which captures more realistic models of liquidity constraints that\nthe agents may have.

The\nfirst set, which often outperforms other oracles, employs embedding of the\ngraph into low dimensional Euclidean spaces with carefully constructed\nhyperbolic distances, but provides no guarantees on the distance estimation\nerror. The second set leverages Gromov-type tree contraction of the graph with\nthe additive error guaranteed not to exceed $2\\delta\\log{n}$, where $\\delta$ is\nthe hyperbolic constant of the graph. We show that our proposed oracle 1) is\nsignificantly faster than those oracles that use hyperbolic embedding (first\nset) with similar approximation error and, perhaps surprisingly, 2) exhibits\nsubstantially lower average estimation error compared to Gromov-like tree\ncontractions (second set). We substantiate our claims through numerical\ncomputations on a collection of a dozen real world networks and synthetic test\ncases from multiple domains, ranging in size from 10s of thousand to 10s of\nmillions of nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Apr 2014 02:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-22"}

However,\nfew works studied the energy disaggregation of plug-in electric vehicle (EV)\ncharging in the residential environment since EVs charging at home has emerged\nonly recently. Recent studies showed that EV charging has a large impact on\nsmart-grid especially in summer. Therefore, EV charging monitoring has become a\nmore important and urgent missing piece in energy disaggregation. In this\npaper, we present a novel method to disaggregate EV charging signals from\naggregated real power signals. The proposed method can effectively mitigate\ninterference coming from air-conditioner (AC), enabling accurate EV charging\ndetection and energy estimation under the presence of AC power signals.\nBesides, the proposed algorithm requires no training, demands a light\ncomputational load, delivers high estimation accuracy, and works well for data\nrecorded at the low sampling rate 1/60 Hz. When the algorithm is tested on\nreal-world data recorded from 11 houses over about a whole year (total 125\nmonths worth of data), the averaged error in estimating energy consumption of\nEV charging is 15.7 kwh/month (while the true averaged energy consumption of EV\ncharging is 208.5 kwh/month), and the averaged normalized mean square error in\ndisaggregating EV charging load signals is 0.19.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Apr 2014 06:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2014 02:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Since it does not require\nto fix the number of clusters in advance, the mean shift has been a popular\nclustering algorithm in various application fields. A typical implementation of\nthe mean shift is to first estimate the density by kernel density estimation\nand then compute its gradient. However, since good density estimation does not\nnecessarily imply accurate estimation of the density gradient, such an indirect\ntwo-step approach is not reliable. In this paper, we propose a method to\ndirectly estimate the gradient of the log-density without going through density\nestimation. The proposed method gives the global solution analytically and thus\nis computationally efficient. We then develop a mean-shift-like fixed-point\nalgorithm to find the modes of the density for clustering. As in the mean\nshift, one does not need to set the number of clusters in advance. We\nempirically show that the proposed clustering method works much better than the\nmean shift especially for high-dimensional data.

The recently identified\ncoordinated data injection attacks to meter measurements can bypass the current\nsecurity system and introduce errors to the state estimates. The conventional\nwisdom to mitigate such attacks is by securing meter measurements to evade\nmalicious injections. In this paper, we provide a novel alternative to defend\nagainst false-data injection attacks using covert power network topological\ninformation. By keeping the exact reactance of a set of transmission lines from\nattackers, no false data injection attack can be launched to compromise any set\nof state variables. We first investigate from the attackers' perspective the\nnecessary condition to perform injection attack. Based on the arguments, we\ncharacterize the optimal protection problem, which protects the state variables\nwith minimum cost, as a well-studied Steiner tree problem in a graph. Besides,\nwe also propose a mixed defending strategy that jointly considers the use of\ncovert topological information and secure meter measurements when either method\nalone is costly or unable to achieve the protection objective. A mixed integer\nlinear programming (MILP) formulation is introduced to obtain the optimal mixed\ndefending strategy. To tackle the NP-hardness of the problem, a tree\npruning-based heuristic is further presented to produce an approximate solution\nin polynomial time. The advantageous performance of the proposed defending\nmechanisms is verified in IEEE standard power system testcases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Apr 2014 08:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-19"}
