One scalability problem shared\nby many probabilistic logics is that answering queries involves \"grounding\" the\nquery---i.e., mapping it to a propositional representation---and the size of a\n\"grounding\" grows with database size. To address this bottleneck, we present a\nfirst-order probabilistic language called ProPPR in which that approximate\n\"local groundings\" can be constructed in time independent of database size.\nTechnically, ProPPR is an extension to stochastic logic programs (SLPs) that is\nbiased towards short derivations; it is also closely related to an earlier\nrelational learning algorithm called the path ranking algorithm (PRA). We show\nthat the problem of constructing proofs for this logic is related to\ncomputation of personalized PageRank (PPR) on a linearized version of the proof\nspace, and using on this connection, we develop a proveably-correct approximate\ngrounding scheme, based on the PageRank-Nibble algorithm.

The theory is topological and, since there are no propagating field\ndegrees of freedom, the asymptotic symmetries become all the more crucial. For\npure (2+1) gravity they consist of two copies of the Virasoro algebra. There\nexists a black hole which may be endowed with all the corresponding charges.\nThe pure (2+1) gravity theory may be reformulated in terms of two Chern-Simons\nconnections for sl(2,R). An immediate generalization containing gravity and a\nfinite number of higher spin fields may be achieved by replacing sl(2,R) by\nsl(3,R) or, more generally, by sl(N,R). The asymptotic symmetries are then two\ncopies of the so-called W_N algebra, which contains the Virasoro algebra as a\nsubalgebra. The question then arises as to whether there exists a\ngeneralization of the standard pure gravity (2+1) black hole which would be\nendowed with all the W_N charges. The original pioneering proposal of a black\nhole along this line for N=3 turns out, as shown in this paper, to actually\nbelong to the so called \"diagonal embedding\" of sl(2,R) in sl(3,R), and it is\ntherefore endowed with charges of lower rather than higher spins. In\ncontradistinction, we exhibit herein the most general black hole which belongs\nto the \"principal embedding\". It is endowed with higher spin charges, and\npossesses two copies of W_3 as its asymptotic symmetries. The most general\ndiagonal embedding black hole is studied in detail as well, in a way in which\nits lower spin charges are clearly displayed. The extension to N>3 is also\ndiscussed. A general formula for the entropy of a generalized black hole is\nobtained in terms of the on-shell holonomies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Apr 2014 17:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The three\ndistributions we consider are derived from the gamma-Poisson, gamma-negative\nbinomial, and beta-negative binomial processes. Because the models lead to\nclosed-form Gibbs sampling update equations, they are natural candidates for\nnonparametric Bayesian priors over count matrices. A key aspect of our analysis\nis the recognition that, although the random count matrices within the family\nare defined by a row-wise construction, their columns can be shown to be i.i.d.\nThis fact is used to derive explicit formulas for drawing all the columns at\nonce. Moreover, by analyzing these matrices' combinatorial structure, we\ndescribe how to sequentially construct a column-i.i.d. random count matrix one\nrow at a time, and derive the predictive distribution of a new row count vector\nwith previously unseen features. We describe the similarities and differences\nbetween the three priors, and argue that the greater flexibility of the gamma-\nand beta- negative binomial processes, especially their ability to model\nover-dispersed, heavy-tailed count data, makes these well suited to a wide\nvariety of real-world applications.

Since first introduced, machine\nlearning methods have been gaining increasing popularity for AD related\nresearch. Among the various identified biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) are widely used for the prediction of AD or MCI. However, before a\nmachine learning algorithm can be applied, image features need to be extracted\nto represent the MRI images. While good representations can be pivotal to the\nclassification performance, almost all the previous studies typically rely on\nhuman labelling to find the regions of interest (ROI) which may be correlated\nto AD, such as hippocampus, amygdala, precuneus, etc. This procedure requires\ndomain knowledge and is costly and tedious.\n  Instead of relying on extraction of ROI features, it is more promising to\nremove manual ROI labelling from the pipeline and directly work on the raw MRI\nimages.

Heisenberg\nderived this famous relation under an additional assumption on quantum\nmeasurements that has been abandoned in the modern theory, and its universal\nvalidity was questioned in a debate on the sensitivity limit to\ngravitational-wave detectors in 1980s. A universally valid form of the\nerror-disturbance relation was shown to be derived in the modern framework of\ngeneral quantum measurements in 2003. We have experienced a considerable\nprogress in theoretical and experimental study of error-disturbance relations\nin the last decade. In 2013 Branciard showed a new stronger form of universally\nvalid error-disturbance relations, one of which is proved tight for spin\nmeasurements carried out in \"pure\" states. Nevertheless, a recent\ninformation-theoretical study of error-disturbance relations has suggested that\nBranciard relations can be considerably strengthened for measurements in mixed\nstates. Here, we show a method for strengthening Branciard relations in mixed\nstates and derive several new universally valid and stronger error-disturbance\nrelations in mixed states. In particular, it is proved that one of them gives\nan ultimate error-disturbance relation for spin measurements, which is tight in\nany state. The new relations will play an important role in applications to\nstate estimation problems including quantum cryptographic scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Apr 2014 14:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-15"}

The sparse multiple measurement vector signals\n(MMVs) observed by all the nodes are assumed to have a common (but unknown)\nsparsity pattern. To accurately recover the common sparsity pattern in a\ndecentralized manner with a low communication overhead of the network, we\ndevelop an algorithm named decentralized and collaborative subspace pursuit\n(DCSP). In DCSP, each node is required to perform three kinds of operations per\niteration: 1) estimate the local sparsity pattern by finding the subspace that\nits measurement vector most probably lies in; 2) share its local sparsity\npattern estimate with one-hop neighboring nodes; and 3) update the final\nsparsity pattern estimate by majority vote based fusion of all the local\nsparsity pattern estimates obtained in its neighborhood. The convergence of\nDCSP is proved and its communication overhead is quantitatively analyzed. We\nalso propose another decentralized algorithm named generalized DCSP (GDCSP) by\nallowing more information exchange among neighboring nodes to further improve\nthe accuracy of sparsity pattern recovery at the cost of increased\ncommunication overhead. Experimental results show that, 1) compared with\nexisting decentralized algorithms, DCSP provides much better accuracy of\nsparsity pattern recovery at a comparable communication cost; and 2) the\naccuracy of GDCSP is very close to that of centralized processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Apr 2014 15:35:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 08:36:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}
