Superfluid spin transport is\nachieved by inserting the antiferromagnet between two metallic reservoirs and\nestablishing a spin accumulation in one reservoir such that a spin bias is\napplied across the magnet. We consider a class of bipartite antiferromagnets\nwith Neel ground states, and temperatures well below the ordering temperature,\nwhere spin transport is mediated essentially by the condensate. Landau-Lifshitz\nand magneto-circuit theories are used to directly relate spin current in\ndifferent parts of the heterostructure to the spin-mixing conductances\ncharacterizing the antiferromagnet|metal interfaces and the antiferromagnet\nbulk damping parameters, quantities all obtainable from experiments. We study\nthe efficiency of spin angular-momentum transfer at an antiferromagnet|metal\ninterface by developing a microscopic scattering theory for the interface and\nextracting the spin-mixing conductance for a simple model. Within the model, a\nquantitative comparison between the spin-mixing conductances obtained for the\nantiferromagnet|metal and ferromagnet|metal interfaces is made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 16:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

This class of problems is,\nin fact, an extension of the Slepian-Wolf model, but where cost-constrained\nactions taken by the encoder or the decoder affect the generation of one of the\nsources. The purpose of this work is to study the implications of actions on\nthe achievable rates.\n  In particular, two cases where transmission occurs over a rate-limited link\nare studied; case A for actions taken at the decoder and case B where actions\nare taken at the encoder. A complete single-letter characterization of the set\nof achievable rates is given in both cases. Furthermore, a network coding setup\nis investigated for the case where actions are taken at the encoder.

Epistasis can\nprofoundly influence the process of evolution in populations under selection,\nand can shape the course of protein evolution across divergent species. Whereas\nepistasis between adaptive substitutions has been the subject of extensive\nstudy, relatively little is known about epistasis under purifying selection.\nHere we use mechanistic models of thermodynamic stability in a ligand-binding\nprotein to explore the structure of epistatic interactions between\nsubstitutions that fix in protein sequences under purifying selection. We find\nthat the selection coefficients of mutations that are nearly-neutral when they\nfix are highly contingent on the presence of preceding mutations. Conversely,\nmutations that are nearly-neutral when they fix are subsequently entrenched due\nto epistasis with later substitutions. Our evolutionary model includes\ninsertions and deletions, as well as point mutations, and so it allows us to\nquantify epistasis within each of these classes of mutations, and also to study\nthe evolution of protein length. We find that protein length remains largely\nconstant over time, because indels are more deleterious than point mutations.\nOur results imply that, even under purifying selection, protein sequence\nevolution is highly contingent on history and so it cannot be predicted by the\nphenotypic effects of mutations assayed in the wild-type sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 18:18:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 17:03:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 19:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

It is assumed that there are one white sub-band, and one\ntarget sub-band which is either white or non-white. Under this assumption,\nfirst we propose a novel generalized energy detector (GED) for examining the\ntarget sub-band by exploiting the noise information of the white sub-band,\nthen, we study the tradeoff between the sensing time and achievable throughput\nof the CR network. To study this tradeoff, we consider the sensing time\noptimization for maximizing the throughput of the CR network while\nappropriately protecting the primary network. The sensing time is optimized by\nutilizing the derived detection and false alarm probabilities of the GED. The\nproposed GED does not suffer from signal to noise ratio (SNR) wall (i.e.,\nrobust against noise variance uncertainty) and outperforms the existing signal\ndetectors. Moreover, the relationship between the proposed GED and conventional\nenergy detector (CED) is quantified analytically. We show that the optimal\nsensing times with perfect and imperfect noise variances are not the same. In\nparticular, when the frame duration is 2s, and SNR is -20dB, and each of the\nbandwidths of the white and target sub-bands is 6MHz, the optimal sensing times\nare 28.5ms and 50.6ms with perfect and imperfect noise variances, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 18:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}

Such flux limiter was originally proposed in [Xu, Math. Comp., 2013]\nand further developed in [Xiong et. al., J. Comp. Phys., 2013] for finite\ndifference WENO schemes with Runge-Kutta time discretization for convection\nequations. The main idea is to limit the temporal integrated high order\nnumerical flux toward a first order MPP monotone flux. In this paper, we\ngeneralize such flux limiter to high order finite volume methods solving\nconvection-dominated problems, which is easy to implement and introduces little\ncomputational overhead. More importantly, for the first time in the finite\nvolume setting, we provide a general proof that the proposed flux limiter\nmaintains high order accuracy of the original WENO scheme for linear advection\nproblems without any additional time step restriction. For general nonlinear\nconvection-dominated problems, we prove that the proposed flux limiter\nintroduces up to $O(\\Delta x^3+\\Delta t^3)$ modification to the high order\ntemporal integrated flux in the original WENO scheme without extra time step\nconstraint.

Examples\nof such configurations are hedgehogs (points at which all spins are either\npointing inwards or outwards) or vortices.

When long-range\nmagnetic order is suppressed under pressure, the key characteristic of the\nskyrmion lattice - that is, the topological Hall signal due to the emergent\nmagnetic flux associated with their topological winding - is unaffected in sign\nor magnitude and becomes an important characteristic of the metallic state. The\nregime of the topological Hall signal in temperature, pressure and magnetic\nfield coincides thereby with the exceptionally extended regime of a pronounced\nnon-Fermi-liquid resistivity.

Their defining property is that an adiabatic braid\nbetween two of them results in a nontrivial change of the quantum state of the\nsystem. To date, no experimental platform has reached the desired control over\nnon-Abelian quasiparticles to demonstrate this remarkable property. The\nsimplest non-Abelian quasiparticles -- the Majorana bound states (MBS) -- can\noccur in one-dimensional (1D) electronic nano-structures proximity-coupled to a\nbulk superconductor -- a platform that is being currently explored in great\ndepth both theoretically and experimentally. When tuned appropriately, such\nnano-wires can localize MBS at their ends, a pair of which forms a two-level\nsystem that is robust to local perturbations. This constitutes a topologically\nprotected qubit that can serve as the building block for a topological quantum\ncomputer. To implement braiding operations among the MBS, schemes that allow to\nmove MBS across wire networks have been explored theoretically. Here, we\npropose a simpler alternative setup, based on chains of magnetic adatoms on the\nsurface of a thin-film superconductor, in which the control over an externally\napplied magnetic field suffices to create and manipulate MBS. We consider\nspecific 1D patterns of adatoms, which can be engineered with\nscanning-tunneling-microscope based lateral atomic manipulation techniques, and\nshow that they allow for the creation, annihilation, adiabatic motion, and\nbraiding of pairs of MBS by varying the magnitude and orientation of the\nexternal magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 20:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-28"}

It has been suggested that the bow shocks of runaway stars are\nsources of high-energy gamma rays (E > 100 MeV). Theoretical models predicting\nhigh-energy gamma-ray emission from these sources were followed by the first\ndetection of non-thermal radio emission from the bow shock of BD+43$^\\deg$ 3654\nand non-thermal X-ray emission from the bow shock of AE Aurigae. Aims. We\nperform the first systematic search for MeV and GeV emission from 27 bow shocks\nof runaway stars using data collected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard\nthe Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi). Methods. We analysed 57 months of\nFermi-LAT data at the positions of 27 bow shocks of runaway stars extracted\nfrom the Extensive stellar BOw Shock Survey catalogue (E-BOSS). A likelihood\nanalysis was performed to search for gamma-ray emission that is not compatible\nwith diffuse background or emission from neighbouring sources and that could be\nassociated with the bow shocks. Results. None of the bow shock candidates is\ndetected significantly in the Fermi-LAT energy range. We therefore present\nupper limits on the high-energy emission in the energy range from 100 MeV to\n300 GeV for 27 bow shocks of runaway stars in four energy bands. For the three\ncases where models of the high-energy emission are published we compare our\nupper limits to the modelled spectra.

Given that the shock velocity during shock breakout is\nnot measured, we expect a correlation, with a significant spread, between the\nrise time and the peak luminosity of these SNe.

The lower\nlimits on the shock velocity we find are consistent with what is expected for\nSNe (i.e., ~10^4 km/s). This supports the suggestion that the early-time light\ncurves of SNe IIn are caused by shock breakout in a dense CSM. We note that\nsuch a correlation can arise from other physical mechanisms.

The recent discovery\nof ultrastable glasses that are obtained by depositing the vapor of a\nglass-forming liquid onto the surface of a cold substrate has sparked renewed\ninterest in the effects of confinements on physicochemical properties of\nliquids and glasses. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the\neffect of substrate on thin films of a model glass-forming liquid, the\nKob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones system, and compute profiles of several\nthermodynamic and kinetic properties across the film. We observe that the\nsubstrate can induce large oscillations in profiles of thermodynamic properties\nsuch as density, composition and stress, and we establish a correlation between\nthe oscillations in total density and the oscillations in normal stress. We\nalso demonstrate that the kinetic properties of an atomic film can be readily\ntuned by changing the strength of interactions between the substrate and the\nliquid. Most notably, we show that a weakly attractive substrate can induce the\nemergence of a highly mobile region in its vicinity. In this highly mobile\nregion, structural relaxation is several times faster than in the bulk, and the\nexploration of the potential energy landscape is also more efficient. In the\nsubsurface region near a strongly attractive substrate, however, the dynamics\nis decelerated and the sampling of the potential energy landscape becomes less\nefficient than the bulk. We explain these two distinct behaviors by\nestablishing a correlation between the oscillations in kinetic properties and\nthe oscillations in lateral stress.

In this paper we derive a simple scaling model\nfor the cost of large accelerators and colliding beam facilities based on costs\nof 17 big facilities which have been either built or carefully estimated.\nAlthough this approach cannot replace an actual cost estimate based on an\nengineering design, this parameterization is to indicate a somewhat realistic\ncost range for consideration of what future frontier accelerator facilities\nmight be fiscally realizable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 22:11:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

They need to rely on the\nenergy harvested from the signals broadcasted by the AP for their cooperative\ninformation transmission. Based on this three-node reference model, we propose\na harvest-then-cooperate (HTC) protocol, in which the source and relay harvest\nenergy from the AP in the downlink and work cooperatively in the uplink for the\nsource's information transmission. Considering a delay-limited transmission\nmode, the approximate closed-form expression for the average throughput of the\nproposed protocol is derived over Rayleigh fading channels. Subsequently, this\nanalysis is extended to the multi-relay scenario, where the approximate\nthroughput of the HTC protocol with two popular relay selection schemes is\nderived. The asymptotic analyses for the throughput performance of the\nconsidered schemes at high signal-to-noise radio are also provided. All\ntheoretical results are validated by numerical simulations.

The magnetic phase diagram with varied carrier doping, and\non-site Coulomb interaction is found to be complex. In addition to the\nintrinsic antiferromag- netic solution, as predicted for charge neutral\nhexagonal nanoflake, fully polarized ferromagnetic, and mixed phase solutions\nare obtained depending on the doped carrier concentration, and on-site Coulomb\ninteraction. The complexity arises due to the competing nature of local Coulomb\nin- teraction and carrier doping, favoring antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic\ncoupling, respectively. Chemical modification of the edge atoms by hydrogen\nleads to partial quenching of local moments, giving rise to a richer phase\ndiagram consisting of antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, mixed, and nonmagnetic\nphases.

The aim of this study to explore the phase behaviour of two-component\nbottle-brushes depending on parameters, such as as the grafting density\n$\\sigma$, the backbone length $N_b$, the side-chain length $N$, and the\ntemperature $T$. Based on a cluster analysis, we identify for our range of\nparameters the regimes of fully phase separated systems, i.e., A-type side\nchains form one cluster and B-type chains another, while the interface that\nseparates these two clusters contains the backbone monomers. We find that\npearl-necklace or Janus-like structures, which normally occur for bottle-brush\npolymers with rigid backbones under poor solvent conditions, are fully\nattributed to the backbone rigidity, and, therefore, such structures are\nunlikely in the case of bottle brushes with fully flexible backbones. Also, a\ncomparative discussion with earlier work on the phase behaviour of\nsingle-component bottle-brush polymers with flexible backbones is performed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2014 07:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-17"}

Here we model the dust distribution in the outer solar system to\nreproduce the dust impact rates onto the dust detector onboard the New Horizons\nspacecraft measured so far and to predict the rates during the Neptune orbit\ntraverse. To this end, we take a realistic distribution of transneptunian\nobjects to launch a sufficient number of dust grains of different sizes and\nfollow their orbits by including radiation pressure, Poynting-Robertson and\nstellar wind drag, as well as the perturbations of four giant planets. In a\nsubsequent statistical analysis, we calculate number densities and lifetimes of\nthe dust grains in order to simulate a collisional cascade. In contrast to the\nprevious work, our model not only considers collisional elimination of\nparticles, but also includes production of finer debris. We find that particles\ncaptured in the 3:2 resonance with Neptune build clumps that are not removed by\ncollisions, because the depleting effect of collisions is counteracted by\nproduction of smaller fragments. Our model successfully reproduces the dust\nimpact rates measured by New Horizons out to ~23AU and predicts an increase of\nthe impact rate of about a factor of two or three around the Neptune orbit\ncrossing.

The\ndiffusion of water vapor in the porous medium of the firn pack attenuates the\ninitial isotopic signal, predominantly having an impact on the high frequency\ncomponents of the power spectrum. Higher temperatures induce higher rates of\nsmoothing and thus the signal can be used as a firn paleothermometer.

Sub-solidus\nconvection was one of the early suggestions to explain the seismic anisotropy,\nbut it requires an unstable density gradient either from thermal or\ncompositional origin, or from both. Temperature and composition profiles in the\ninner core are computed using a unidimensional model of core evolution\nincluding diffusion in the inner core and fractional crystallisation at the\ninner core boundary (ICB). The thermal conductivity of the core has been\nrecently revised upwardly and, moreover, found to increase with depth. Values\nof the heat flow across the core mantle boundary (CMB) sufficient to maintain\nconvection in the whole outer core are not sufficient to make the temperature\nin the inner core super-isentropic and therefore prone to thermal instability.\nAn unreasonably high CMB heat flow is necessary to this end. The compositional\nstratification results from a competition of the increase of the concentration\nof light elements in the outer core with inner core growth, which makes the\ninner core concentration also increase, and of the decrease of the liquidus,\nwhich makes the partition coefficient decrease as well as the concentration of\nlight elements in the solid. While the latter (destabilizing) effect dominates\nat small inner core sizes, the former takes over for a large inner core. The\nturnover point is encountered for an inner core about half its current size in\nthe case of S, but much larger for the case of O. The combined thermal and\ncompositional buoyancy is stabilizing and solid-state convection in the inner\ncore appears unlikely, unless an early double-diffusive instability can set in.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2014 12:36:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 20:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-12"}

In addition, we test the linear stability of the\nwavetrains and show that only a small subset are stable.

We solve this massive J-R model exactly and\nanalytically and obtain the whole spectrum of the fermion, including the bound\nand continuum states. The mass term of the fermion makes the potential of the\ndecoupled second order Schrodinger-like equations asymmetric in a way that\ntheir asymptotic values at two spatial infinities are different. Therefore, we\nencounter the unusual problem in which two kinds of continuum states are\npossible for the fermion: reflecting and scattering states. We then show the\nenergies of all the states as a function of the parameters of the kink, i.e.\nits value at spatial infinity ($\\theta_0$) and its slope at $x=0$ ($\\mu$). The\ngraph of the energies as a function of $\\theta_0$, where the bound state\nenergies and the two kinds of continuum states are depicted, shows peculiar\nfeatures including an energy gap in the form of a triangle where no bound\nstates exist.

Findings from 72\nfaculty members revealed an overall positive stance toward technology in the\nclassroom and the average faculty member utilized about six technology tools in\ntheir courses. The opportunities, barriers and future uses for technologies in\nthe higher education classroom emerged from the open-ended questions on the\nsurvey. One finding of particular concern is that faculty are fearful that\ntechnology causes a loss of the humanistic perspective in education. The\nuniversity is redesigning ten of its most popular courses to increase\nflexibility, accessibility and student success.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 18:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-17"}

Choosing too few topics will produce results that are\noverly broad, while choosing too many will result in the \"over-clustering\" of a\ncorpus into many small, highly-similar topics. In this paper, we propose a\nterm-centric stability analysis strategy to address this issue, the idea being\nthat a model with an appropriate number of topics will be more robust to\nperturbations in the data. Using a topic modeling approach based on matrix\nfactorization, evaluations performed on a range of corpora show that this\nstrategy can successfully guide the model selection process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Apr 2014 12:59:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 May 2014 12:58:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 12:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-20"}
