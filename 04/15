Peer grading -- having\nstudents assess each other -- is a promising approach to tackling the problem\nof evaluation at scale, since the number of \"graders\" naturally scales with the\nnumber of students. However, students are not trained in grading, which means\nthat one cannot expect the same level of grading skills as in traditional\nsettings. Drawing on broad evidence that ordinal feedback is easier to provide\nand more reliable than cardinal feedback, it is therefore desirable to allow\npeer graders to make ordinal statements (e.g. \"project X is better than project\nY\") and not require them to make cardinal statements (e.g. \"project X is a\nB-\"). Thus, in this paper we study the problem of automatically inferring\nstudent grades from ordinal peer feedback, as opposed to existing methods that\nrequire cardinal peer feedback. We formulate the ordinal peer grading problem\nas a type of rank aggregation problem, and explore several probabilistic models\nunder which to estimate student grades and grader reliability. We study the\napplicability of these methods using peer grading data collected from a real\nclass -- with instructor and TA grades as a baseline -- and demonstrate the\nefficacy of ordinal feedback techniques in comparison to existing cardinal peer\ngrading methods. Finally, we compare these peer-grading techniques to\ntraditional evaluation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 17:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-15"}

In this paper,\nwe study the effect of controlling the decoding delay to reduce the completion\ntime below its currently best known solution in persistent erasure channels. We\nfirst derive the decoding-delay-dependent expressions of the users' and overall\ncompletion times. Although using such expressions to find the optimal overall\ncompletion time is NP-hard, we design two novel heuristics that minimizes the\nprobability of increasing the maximum of these decoding-delay-dependent\ncompletion time expressions after each transmission through a layered control\nof their decoding delays. We, then, extend our study to the limited feedback\nscenario.

In line with recently upcoming research to develop\nmultivariate post-processing procedures, e.g., BMA for bivariate wind vectors,\nor flexible procedures applicable for multiple weather quantities of different\ntypes, a bivariate BMA model for joint calibration of wind speed and\ntemperature forecasts is proposed based on the bivariate truncated normal\ndistribution.

Furthermore, the power-law parameterization gives a blue-tilt\ntensor spectrum, no matter using only the first 5 bandpowers $n_t =\n1.20^{+0.56}_{-0.64} (95% {\\rm CL})$ or the full 9 bandpowers $n_t =\n1.24^{+0.51}_{-0.58} (95% {\\rm CL})$ of BICEP2 data sets. Unlike the large\ntensor-to-scalar ratio value ($r\\sim0.20$) under the scale-invariant tensor\nspectrum assumption, our interpolation approach gives $r_{0.002} < 0.060 (95%\n{\\rm CL})$ by using the first 5 bandpowers of BICEP2 data.

For adult somatic cells, location and dynamics of\nmethylation has been very precisely pinned down with the 5-cytosine markers on\ncytosinephosphate- guanine (CpG) units. Unusual methylation on CpG islands are\nidentified as one of the prime causes for silencing the tumor suppressant\ngenes. Early detection of such methylation can diagnose the potentially harmful\noncogenic evolution of cells, and provide a promising guideline for cancer\nprevention.

This difference in electronic fingerprints\nwould allow for reliable real-time differentiations of methylated DNA. We\ncalculate transport currents through a punctured graphene membrane while the\ncytosine and methylated cytosine translocate through the nanopore.

Secondly, we provide an operational interpretation for quantum\ninformation complexity: we show that it is exactly equal to the amortized\nquantum communication complexity of a bipartite channel on a given state. This\ngeneralizes a result of Braverman and Rao to quantum protocols, and even\nstrengthens the classical result in a bounded round scenario. Also, this\nprovides an analogue of the Schumacher source compression theorem for\ninteractive quantum protocols, and answers a question raised by Braverman.\n  We also discuss some potential applications to quantum communication\ncomplexity lower bounds by specializing our definition for classical functions\nand inputs. Building on work of Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen, we provide new\nevidence suggesting that the bounded round quantum communication complexity of\nthe disjointness function is \\Omega (n/M + M), for M-message protocols. This\nwould match the best known upper bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 20:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}

It is common in both signal\nprocessing and statistics to assume the linear response model y_i = <a_i, x> +\ne_i, where e_i is a noise term. However, in practice the precise relationship\nbetween the signal x and the observations y_i may not follow the linear model,\nand in some cases it may not even be known. To address this challenge, in this\npaper we propose a general model where it is only assumed that each observation\ny_i may depend on a_i only through <a_i, x>. We do not assume that the\ndependence is known. This is a form of the semiparametric single index model,\nand it includes the linear model as well as many forms of the generalized\nlinear model as special cases. We further assume that the signal x has some\nstructure, and we formulate this as a general assumption that x belongs to some\nknown (but arbitrary) feasible set K. We carefully detail the benefit of using\nthe signal structure to improve estimation. The theory is based on the mean\nwidth of K, a geometric parameter which can be used to understand its effective\ndimension in estimation problems. We determine a simple, efficient two-step\nprocedure for estimating the signal based on this model -- a linear estimation\nfollowed by metric projection onto K. We give general conditions under which\nthe estimator is minimax optimal up to a constant. This leads to the intriguing\nconclusion that in the high noise regime, an unknown non-linearity in the\nobservations does not significantly reduce one's ability to determine the\nsignal, even when the non-linearity may be non-invertible.

The challenge is to\ncontinually maintain near-optimal solutions to the underlying optimization\nproblems, without creating too much churn in the solution itself. We model this\nas a multistage combinatorial optimization problem where the input is a\nsequence of cost functions (one for each time step); while we can change the\nsolution from step to step, we incur an additional cost for every such change.\nWe study the multistage matroid maintenance problem, where we need to maintain\na base of a matroid in each time step under the changing cost functions and\nacquisition costs for adding new elements. The online version of this problem\ngeneralizes online paging. E.g., given a graph, we need to maintain a spanning\ntree $T_t$ at each step: we pay $c_t(T_t)$ for the cost of the tree at time\n$t$, and also $| T_t\\setminus T_{t-1} |$ for the number of edges changed at\nthis step. Our main result is an $O(\\log m \\log r)$-approximation, where $m$ is\nthe number of elements/edges and $r$ is the rank of the matroid. We also give\nan $O(\\log m)$ approximation for the offline version of the problem. These\nbounds hold when the acquisition costs are non-uniform, in which caseboth these\nresults are the best possible unless P=NP.\n  We also study the perfect matching version of the problem, where we must\nmaintain a perfect matching at each step under changing cost functions and\ncosts for adding new elements. Surprisingly, the hardness drastically\nincreases: for any constant $\\epsilon>0$, there is no\n$O(n^{1-\\epsilon})$-approximation to the multistage matching maintenance\nproblem, even in the offline case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 22:20:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}

It allows the\nrobust identification of molecular species, and it can be applied to both\ntransiting and non-transiting planets. Radial-velocity measurements of the star\nHD 179949 indicate the presence of a giant planet companion in a close-in\norbit. Here we present the analysis of spectra of the system at 2.3 micron,\nobtained at a resolution of R~100,000, during three nights of observations with\nCRIRES at the VLT. We targeted the system while the exoplanet was near superior\nconjunction, aiming to detect the planet's thermal spectrum and the radial\ncomponent of its orbital velocity. We detect molecular absorption from carbon\nmonoxide and water vapor with a combined S/N of 6.3, at a projected planet\norbital velocity of K_P = (142.8 +- 3.4) km/s, which translates into a planet\nmass of M_P = (0.98 +- 0.04) Jupiter masses, and an orbital inclination of i =\n(67.7 +- 4.3) degrees, using the known stellar radial velocity and stellar\nmass. The detection of absorption features rather than emission means that,\ndespite being highly irradiated, HD 179949 b does not have an atmospheric\ntemperature inversion in the probed range of pressures and temperatures. Since\nthe host star is active (R_HK > -4.9), this is in line with the hypothesis that\nstellar activity damps the onset of thermal inversion layers owing to UV flux\nphoto-dissociating high-altitude, optical absorbers. Finally, our analysis\nfavors an oxygen-rich atmosphere for HD 179949 b, although a carbon-rich planet\ncannot be statistically ruled out based on these data alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 22:26:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-28"}

For hexachiral cells, the solution of Liu et al., 2012, is found,\nshowing the auxetic property of the lattice together with the elastic coupling\nmodulus between the normal and the asymmetric strains; a property that has been\nconfirmed here for the tetrachiral lattice. Unlike the hexagonal lattice, the\nclassical constitutive equations of the tetragonal lattice turns out to be\ncharacterized by the coupling between the normal and shear strains through an\nelastic modulus that is an odd function of the parameter of chirality.\nMoreover, this lattice is found to exhibit a remarkable variability of the\nYoung's modulus and of the Poisson's ratio with the direction of the applied\nuniaxial stress. The properties of the equivalent micropolar continuum are\nqualitatively detected also in the equivalent second-gradient continuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 00:37:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}

The\nanisotropy of the upper critical field was discussed by analyzing the\ntemperature dependence of the temperature derivative of resistivity. The\ntemperature dependence of upper critical field showed an anomalous behavior\nwith a characteristic magnetic field of 8 T. We revealed that the anomalous\nbehavior was caused by the existence of three kinds of upper critical field,\nHC2max, HC2mid and HC2min in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The lowest upper critical field\nHC2min is regarded as the Hc2 where the superconducting states of the grains\nwith an orientation of H // c are suppressed. The HC2max and HC2mid are\nregarded as the Hc2 where the superconducting states of the grains with an\norientation of H // ab are suppressed. The difference between the HC2max and\nHC2mid could be explained by the anisotropy of superconducting states within\nthe Bi-S plane. The estimated anisotropy parameter of the upper critical fields\nwas about 7.4 for the high-pressure-synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 polycrystalline\nsample. Since the value was clearly lower than the anisotropy parameter of over\n30 observed in the previous report on the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystals grown\nunder ambient pressure, we concluded that a larger anisotropy of\nsuperconductivity was not essential for the enhancement of Tc, and lower\nanisotropy might be important for a higher Tc in LaO1-xFxBiS2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 01:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-28"}

The times of stress level elevating are\nrandom and vary from product to product. In this paper we extend this model to\na more economic plan. The proposed extended model has two economical advantages\ncompared with the previous one. The first is that the times of stress level\nelevating in the new model are identical for all products, which enable us to\nuse only one chamber (oven) for testing all test units. The second is that, the\nnew method does not require continuous inspection and to elevate the stress\nlevel, it is not necessary for the experimenter to inspect the value of the\ndegradation continually. The new method decrease the cost of measurement and\nalso there is no need to use electronic sensors to detect the first passage\ntime of the degradation to the threshold value in the new method. We assume\nthat the degradation path follows a gamma process. The stress level is elevated\nas soon as the measurement of the degradation of one of the test units, at one\nof the specified times, exceeds the threshold value. Under the constraint that\nthe total experimental cost does not exceed a pre-specified budget, the optimal\nsettings including the optimal threshold value, sample size, measurement\nfrequency and termination time are obtained by minimizing the asymptotic\nvariance of an estimated quantile of the lifetime distribution of the product.\nA case study is presented to illustrate the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 03:23:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Jul 2014 04:28:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 12:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-18"}

This is of particular interest in the case of neutrino\nemission from core-collapse supernovae where the measurement of the spectral\nshape for different flavors can provide crucial information about both neutrino\nphysics and the physical conditions close to the proto-neutron star. Whether a\nsystem is chaotic or not can be assessed by the Lyapunov exponents which\nquantify the rate of divergence of nearby trajectories in the system. We have\ndone a numerical case study for a simple toy model of two neutrino flavors with\ntwo momentum states traveling against each other which is known to exhibit\nflavor transition instabilities. We find the leading Lyapunov exponent to be\npositive in all cases, confirming the chaoticity of the system for both the\nnormal and the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. However, more Lyapunov\nexponents were approximately zero in the inverted hierarchy compared to the\nnormal which has implications for the stability of the system. To investigate\nthis, we have calculated a generalized set of normal modes, the so-called\ncovariant Lyapunov vectors. The covariant Lyapunov vectors associated with\nvanishing Lyapunov exponents showed the existence of marginally stable\ndirections in phase space for some cases. While our analysis was done for a toy\nmodel example, it should work equally well for more realistic cases of\nneutrinos streaming from a proto-neutron star and provide valuable insight into\nthe nature of the flavor instability.

The combined\nobservations suggest a complex process starting with the outflow of water from\ntwo small channels, followed by continuous groundwater sapping and headward\nerosion and ending with a catastrophic lake rim collapse and carving of the\nAram Valley, which is synchronous with the 2.5 Ga stage of the Ares Vallis\nformation. The water volume and formative time scale required to carve the Aram\nchannels indicate that a single, rapid (maximum tens of days) and catastrophic\n(flood volume of 9.3?104 km3) event carved the outflow channel. We conclude\nthat a sub-ice lake collapse model can best explain the features of the Aram\nChaos Valley system as well as the time scale required for its formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 10:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}

An excess of X-ray emission below about 2 keV, called soft-excess, is\nvery common in Type 1 AGN spectra. The origin of this feature remains debated.\nOriginally modeled with a blackbody, there are now several possibilities to\nmodel the soft-excess, including warm Comptonization and blurred ionized\nreflection. In this paper, we test ionized-reflection models on Mrk 509, a\nbright Seyfert 1 galaxy for which we have a unique data set, in order to\ndetermine whether it can be responsible for the strong soft-excess. We use ten\nsimultaneous XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL observations performed every four days. We\npresent here the results of the spectral analysis, the evolution of the\nparameters and the variability properties of the X-ray emission. The\napplication of blurred ionized-reflection models leads to a very strong\nreflection and an extreme geometry, but fails to reproduce the broad-band\nspectrum of Mrk 509. Two different scenarios for blurred ionized reflection are\ndiscussed: stable geometry and lamp-post configuration. In both cases we find\nthat the model parameters do not follow the expected relations, indicating that\nthe model is fine-tuned to fit the data without physical justification. A\nlarge, slow variation of the soft-excess without counterpart in the hard X-rays\ncould be explained by a change in ionization of the reflector. However, such a\nchange does not naturally follow from the assumed geometrical configuration.\nWarm Comptonization remains the most probable origin of the soft-excess in this\nobject. Nevertheless, it is possible that both ionized reflection and warm\nComptonization mechanisms can explain the soft-excess in all objects, one\ndominating the other one, depending on the physical conditions of the disk and\nthe corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 10:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

A more interesting and still viable possibility is that the\nstring theoretic QCD axion is charged under an anomalous U(1)_A gauge symmetry.\nIn such case, the axion decay constant can be much lower than the GUT scale if\nmoduli are stabilized near the point of vanishing Fayet-Illiopoulos term, and\nU(1)_A-charged matter fields get a vacuum value far below the GUT scale due to\na tachyonic SUSY breaking scalar mass.

The required localization time is formulated\nfor these schemes, and through analytical results and numerical examples their\nperformances are shown to be generally comparable. However, when the packet\nduration is short (as is the case for a localization packet), and the operating\narea is large (above 3km in at least one dimension), the collision-tolerant\nscheme requires a smaller localization time than the collision-free scheme.\nAfter gathering enough measurements, an iterative Gauss-Newton algorithm is\nemployed by each sensor node for self-localization, and the Cramer Rao lower\nbound is evaluated as a benchmark. Although CTS consumes more energy for packet\ntransmission, it provides a better localization accuracy. Additionally, in this\nscheme the anchor nodes work independently of each other, and can operate\nasynchronously which leads to a simplified implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 11:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}

Particle thermal\nmotions are modeled using billions of independent small random translations and\nrotations, constrained by the excluded volume and the connectivity. This\nalgorithm, applied to a single polymer chain leads to correct static and\ndynamic properties, in the framework where hydrodynamic interactions are\nignored.

In bad solvent\nconditions, a competition between a phase separation (due to the isotropic\ninteraction) and polymerization (due to patches) occurs.

We shortly explore the gain in brown-dwarf science\nthat could be achieved by lowering Gaia's faint-end limit from 20 to 21 mag and\nconclude that two spectral-type sub-classes could be gained in combination with\na fourfold increase in the solar-neighbourhood-volume sampled by Gaia and hence\nin the number of brown dwarfs in the Gaia Catalogue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 12:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}

Here we consider a further extension\nto the reconstruction of tensors of low multi-linear rank in recently\nintroduced hierarchical tensor formats from a small number of measurements.\nHierarchical tensors are a flexible generalization of the well-known Tucker\nrepresentation, which have the advantage that the number of degrees of freedom\nof a low rank tensor does not scale exponentially with the order of the tensor.\nWhile corresponding tensor decompositions can be computed efficiently via\nsuccessive applications of (matrix) singular value decompositions, some\nimportant properties of the singular value decomposition do not extend from the\nmatrix to the tensor case. This results in major computational and theoretical\ndifficulties in designing and analyzing algorithms for low rank tensor\nrecovery. For instance, a canonical analogue of the tensor nuclear norm is\nNP-hard to compute in general, which is in stark contrast to the matrix case.\nIn this book chapter we consider versions of iterative hard thresholding\nschemes adapted to hierarchical tensor formats.

This phenomenon promotes colloidal stabilization of\nbimodal magnetic suspensions and allows efficient magnetic separation of\nnanoparticles used in bioanalysis and water purification. In the present work,\nsize and shape of nanoparticle clouds under the simultaneous action of an\nexternal uniform magnetic field and the flow have been studied in details. In\nexperiments, dilute suspension of iron oxide nanoclusters (of a mean diameter\nof 60 nm) was pushed through a thin slit channel with the nickel microspheres\n(of a mean diameter of 50$\\mu$m) attached to the channel wall. The behavior of\nnanocluster clouds was observed in the steady state using an optical\nmicroscope. In the presence of strong enough flow, the size of the clouds\nmonotonically decreases with increasing flow speed in both longitudinal and\ntransverse magnetic fields. This is qualitatively explained by enhancement of\nhydrodynamic forces washing the nanoclusters away from the clouds. In the\nlongitudinal field, the flow induces asymmetry of the front and the back\nclouds. To explain the flow and the field effects on the clouds, we have\ndeveloped a simple model based on the balance of the stresses and particle\nfluxes on the cloud surface. This model, applied to the case of the magnetic\nfield parallel to the flow, captures reasonably well the flow effect on the\nsize and shape of the cloud and reveals that the only dimensionless parameter\ngoverning the cloud size is the ratio of hydrodynamic-to-magnetic forces - the\nMason number. At strong magnetic interactions considered in the present work\n(dipolar coupling parameter $\\alpha \\geq 2$), the Brownian motion seems not to\naffect the cloud behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 18:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}

The analysis is performed by\ncomparing magnetic field values deduced from lines with different magnetic\nsensitivities, as well as by examining the fine structure of $I\\pm V$ Stokes\nprofiles splitting. It is shown that the field has at least two components,\nwith stronger unresolved flux tubes embedded in weaker ambient field.

This special class of sources, here named \"binary driven\nhypernovae\" (BdHNe), presents a composite sequence composed of four different\nepisodes [...].

However,\naxial distances can be distorted by both the point spread function and by a\nrefractive-index mismatch between the sample and immersion liquid, which are\ndifficult to separate. Additionally, accurate calibration of the axial\ndistances in confocal microscopy remains cumbersome, although several high-end\nmethods exist. In this paper we present two methods to calibrate axial\ndistances in 3D confocal microscopy that are both accurate and easily\nimplemented. With these methods, we measured axial scaling factors as a\nfunction of refractive-index mismatch for high-aperture confocal microscopy\nimaging. We found that our scaling factors are almost completely linearly\ndependent on refractive index and that they were in good agreement with\ntheoretical predictions that take the full vectorial properties of light into\naccount. There was however a strong deviation with the theoretical predictions\nusing (high-angle) geometrical optics, which predict much lower scaling\nfactors. As an illustration, we measured the point-spread-function of a\npoint-scanning confocal microscope and showed that an index-matched,\nmicron-sized spherical object is still significantly elongated due to this PSF,\nwhich confirms that single micron-sized spheres are not well suited to\ndetermine accurate axial calibration nor axial scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 15:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}

We employed four different observing epochs of\nEVN data at 6.7 GHz, spanning almost eight years, which enabled us to measure,\nbesides line-of-sight (l.o.s.) velocities and positions, also l.o.s.\naccelerations and proper motions of methanol masers. In addition, we imaged\nwith the JVLA-B array highly-excited ammonia inversion lines, from (6,6) to\n(13,13), which enabled us to probe the hottest molecular gas very close to the\nexciting source(s). We found five 6.7 GHz maser clusters which are distributed\nover a region extended N-S across ~1500 AU and are associated with three peaks\nof the radio continuum. We proposed that these maser clusters identify three\nindividual high-mass YSOs, named IRS1a, IRS1b, and IRS1c. We modeled the maser\nclusters in IRS1a and IRS1b in terms of edge-on disks in centrifugal\nequilibrium. In the first case, masers may trace a quasi-Keplerian thin disk,\norbiting around a high-mass YSO, IRS1a, of up to 25 solar masses. This YSO\ndominates the bolometric luminosity of the region. The second disk is both\nmassive (<16 Msun within ~500 AU) and thick, and the mass of the central YSO,\nIRS1b, is constrained to be at most a few solar masses.

In particular, intelligent persuasive systems (systems designed to\ninfluence humans via communication) constitute a highly sensitive topic because\nof their intrinsically social nature. Still, ethical studies in this area are\nrare and tend to focus on the output of the required action. Instead, this work\nfocuses on the persuasive acts themselves (e.g. \"is it morally acceptable that\na machine lies or appeals to the emotions of a person to persuade her, even if\nfor a good end?\"). Exploiting a behavioral approach, based on human assessment\nof moral dilemmas -- i.e. without any prior assumption of underlying ethical\ntheories -- this paper reports on a set of experiments. These experiments\naddress the type of persuader (human or machine), the strategies adopted\n(purely argumentative, appeal to positive emotions, appeal to negative\nemotions, lie) and the circumstances. Findings display no differences due to\nthe agent, mild acceptability for persuasion and reveal that truth-conditional\nreasoning (i.e. argument validity) is a significant dimension affecting\nsubjects' judgment. Some implications for the design of intelligent persuasive\nsystems are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 15:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}

The\nproblem encompasses the fundamental embedding problem of finding an isomorphic\ncopy of a poset as an induced substructure of another poset.\n  Model checking existential logic is already NP-hard on a fixed poset; thus we\ninvestigate structural properties of posets yielding conditions for\nfixed-parameter tractability when the problem is parameterized by the sentence.\nWe identify width as a central structural property (the width of a poset is the\nmaximum size of a subset of pairwise incomparable elements); our main\nalgorithmic result is that model checking existential logic on classes of\nfinite posets of bounded width is fixed-parameter tractable. We observe a\nsimilar phenomenon in classical complexity, where we prove that the isomorphism\nproblem is polynomial-time tractable on classes of posets of bounded width;\nthis settles an open problem in order theory.\n  We surround our main algorithmic result with complexity results on less\nrestricted, natural neighboring classes of finite posets, establishing its\ntightness in this sense. We also relate our work with (and demonstrate its\nindependence of) fundamental fixed-parameter tractability results for model\nchecking on digraphs of bounded degree and bounded clique-width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 12:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-13"}

The purpose of\nthis study is to generalize the forbiddance of the time independent localized\nclassical fields in general space time. We generalize the Derrick theorem as\nunstable stationary localized solutions for the nonlinear wave equation or the\nnonlinear Klein - Gordon equation in Minkowski space time. Our approach employs\nthe tensor of the energy - momentum based on Weber's method. We exploite the\nBateman - Caldilora - Kanai model and the Deser method for the research of the\nYang - Mills Lumps as massive solutions. We also use Riemann's coordinates for\nparametrization of tangent space as a local framework. The important point of\nthis article is the homomorphism between the Minkowsian and pseudo Riemann's\nmanifolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Apr 2014 08:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-20"}
