For\nintervals with $z^+=0$, we introduce the transverse momentum distribution\namplitude (TMDA) $\\Psi (x, k_\\perp)$, and write it in terms of VDA $\\Phi (x,\n\\sigma)$. The results of covariant calculations, written in terms of $\\Phi (x,\n\\sigma)$ are converted into expressions involving $\\Psi (x, k_\\perp)$. Starting\nwith scalar toy models, we extend the analysis onto the case of spin-1/2 quarks\nand QCD.

All the simulations show\ndeparture from the axisymmetric case at all wavelengths. We presented two\npossible targets (Beta Com and Procyon) and found that departures up to 16 deg\ncan be detected on the 3rd lobe and higher. In particular, MIRC is the most\nappropriate instrument because it combines good UV coverage and long baselines.\nMoreover, we explored the impact of convection on interferometric planet\nsignature for three prototypes of planets. It is possible to disentangle the\nsignature of the planet at particular wavelengths (either in the infrared or in\nthe optical) by comparing the closure phases of the star at difference phases\nof the planetary transit. Conclusions. The detection and characterisation of\nplanets must be based on a comprehensive knowledge of the host star; this\nincludes the detailed study of the stellar surface convection with\ninterferometric techniques. In this context, RHD simulations are crucial to\nreach this aim. We emphasize that interferometric observations should be pushed\nat high spatial frequencies by accumulating observations on closure phases at\nshort and long baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 16:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

We call these\nprograms not robust against the Power memory model. Formally, a program is\nrobust if every computation under Power has the same data and control\ndependencies as some SC computation.\n  Our contribution is a decision procedure for robustness of concurrent\nprograms against the Power memory model.

The Drude weight indicates that there is little\nchange in the effective mass of these carriers in this temperature range.

The imperfection of\nmeasurements presents two major challenges for information recovery: 1)\n$\\textit{inaccuracy}$: a (dominant) portion $1-p$ of measurements are\ncorrupted; 2) $\\textit{incompleteness}$: a significant fraction of pairs are\nunobservable, i.e. $\\mathcal{G}$ can be highly sparse.\n  Under a natural random outlier model, we characterize the $\\textit{minimax\nrecovery rate}$, that is, the critical threshold of non-corruption rate $p$\nbelow which exact information recovery is infeasible. This accommodates a very\ngeneral class of pairwise relations. For various homogeneous random graph\nmodels (e.g. Erdos Renyi random graphs, random geometric graphs, small world\ngraphs), the minimax recovery rate depends almost exclusively on the edge\nsparsity of the measurement graph $\\mathcal{G}$ irrespective of other graphical\nmetrics. This fundamental limit decays with the group size $M$ at a square root\nrate before entering a connectivity-limited regime. Under the Erdos Renyi\nrandom graph, a tractable combinatorial algorithm is proposed to approach the\nlimit for large $M$ ($M=n^{\\Omega(1)}$), while order-optimal recovery is\nenabled by semidefinite programs in the small $M$ regime.\n  The extended (and most updated) version of this work can be found at\n(http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01369).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 19:28:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 21:23:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 22:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-04"}

Our central premise is that cancer is an evolving\nsystem subject to mutation and selection, and the primary conduit for these\nprocesses to occur is the cancer cell whose behaviour is regulated on multiple\nbiological scales. The selection pressure is mainly driven by the\nmicroenvironment that the tumour is growing in and this acts directly upon the\ncell phenotype. In turn, the phenotype is driven by the intracellular pathways\nthat are regulated by the genotype. Integrating all of these processes is a\nmassive undertaking and requires bridging many biological scales (i.e.\ngenotype, pathway, phenotype and environment) that we will only scratch the\nsurface of in this review. We will focus on models that use neural networks as\na means of connecting these different biological scales, since they allow us to\neasily create heterogeneity for selection to act upon and importantly this\nheterogeneity can be implemented at different biological scales. More\nspecifically, we consider three different neural networks that bridge different\naspects of these scales and the dialogue with the micro-environment, (i) the\nimpact of the micro-environment on evolutionary dynamics, (ii) the mapping from\ngenotype to phenotype under drug-induced perturbations and (iii) pathway\nactivity in both normal and cancer cells under different micro-environmental\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 19:37:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-29"}

With the advent of\ngravitational-wave (GW) astronomy, environmental effects on the GW signal will\neventually have to be quantified. Here we present a wide survey of the\ncorrections due to these effects in two situations of great interest for GW\nastronomy: the black hole (BH) ringdown emission and the inspiral of two\ncompact objects. We take into account various effects such as: electric\ncharges, magnetic fields, cosmological evolution, possible deviations from\nGeneral Relativity, firewalls, and various forms of matter such as accretion\ndisks and dark matter halos. Our analysis predicts the existence of resonances\ndictated by the external mass distribution, which dominate the very late-time\nbehavior of merger/ringdown waveforms. The mode structure can drastically\ndiffer from the vacuum case, yet the BH response to external perturbations is\nunchanged at the time scales relevant for detectors. This is because although\nthe vacuum Schwarzschild resonances are no longer quasinormal modes of the\nsystem, they still dominate the response at intermediate times. Our results\nstrongly suggest that both parametrized and ringdown searches should use at\nleast two-mode templates. Our analysis of compact binaries shows that\nenvironmental effects are typically negligible for most eLISA sources, with the\nexception of very few special extreme mass ratio inspirals. We show in\nparticular that accretion and hydrodynamic drag generically dominate over\nself-force effects for geometrically thin disks, whereas they can be safely\nneglected for geometrically thick disk environments, which are the most\nrelevant for eLISA. Finally, we discuss how our ignorance of the matter\nsurrounding compact objects implies intrinsic limits on the ability to\nconstrain strong-field deviations from General Relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 20:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 May 2014 00:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-17"}

A generalized analysis was done for\ntwo types of couplings between the field and the material.

We\nobtained a closed form for the Hadamard propagator, which let us study the\ndynamical evolution of the expectations values of the energy-momentum tensor\ncomponents from the initial time.

The investigation is carried by integrating\nnumerically the hydrostatic equilibrium equation, i.e., the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, with the hypothesis that the charge\ndistribution is proportional to the energy density. We match the interior to a\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om exterior, and study some features of these star spheres\nsuch as the total mass $M$, the radius $R$, and the total charge $Q$. We also\ndisplay the pressure profile. For star spheres made of a perfect fluid there is\nthe Buchdahl bound, $R/M\\geq 9/4$, a compactness bound found from generic\nprinciples. For the Schwarzschild interior solution there is also the known\ncompactness limit, the interior Schwarzschild limit where the configurations\nattain infinite central pressure, given by $R/M=9/4$, yielding an instance\nwhere the Buchdahl bound is saturated. We study this limit of infinite central\npressure for the electrically charged stars and compare it with the\nBuchdahl-Andr\\'easson bound, a limit that, like the Buchdahl bound for the\nuncharged case, is obtained by imposing some generic physical conditions on\ncharged configurations. We show that the electrical interior Schwarzschild\nlimit of all but two configurations is always below the Buchdahl-Andr\\'easson\nlimit, i.e., we find that the electrical interior Schwarzschild limit does not\ngenerically saturate the Buchdahl-Andr\\'easson bound. We also find that the\nquasiblack hole limit, i.e., the extremal most compact limit for charged\nincompressible stars, is reached when the matter is highly charged and the\nstar's central pressure tends to infinity. This is one of the two instances\nwhere the Buchdahl-Andr\\'easson bound is saturated, the other being the\nuncharged, interior Schwarzschild solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 21:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-11"}

Conclusions: The\nanisotropic positioning of individuals with respect to their neighbours, in\ncombination with noise, can explain several aspects of the movement responses\nobserved in real animal groups, and should be considered explicitly in future\nmodels of flocking and schooling.

We present here the most\ndetailed models to date of the shock wave triggering and injection process,\nwhere shock waves with varied properties strike fully three dimensional,\nrotating, dense cloud cores. The models are calculated with the FLASH adaptive\nmesh hydrodynamics code. Three different outcomes can result: triggered\ncollapse leading to fragmentation into a multiple protostar system; triggered\ncollapse leading to a single protostar embedded in a protostellar disk; or\nfailure to undergo dynamic collapse. Shock wave material is injected into the\ncollapsing clouds through Rayleigh-Taylor fingers, resulting in initially\ninhomogeneous distributions in the protostars and protostellar disks. Cloud\nrotation about an axis aligned with the shock propagation direction does not\nincrease the injection efficiency appreciably, as the shock parameters were\nchosen to be optimal for injection even in the absence of rotation.

The main goal of the short-term\nrecovery is to bounce the damaged system back to the operating standards\nenabling residents in damaged cities to survive, and fast supply with vital\nresources to them is one of its important elements. We propose a general\nprinciple by which the required redistribution of vital resources between the\naffected and neighbouring cities can be efficiently implemented. The short-term\nrecovery is a rescuer operation where uncertainty in evaluating the state of\ndamaged region is highly probable. To allow for such an operation the developed\nprinciple involves two basic components. The first one of ethic nature is the\ntriage concept determining the current city priority in the resource delivery.\nThe second one is the minimization of the delivery time subjected to this\npriority. Finally a certain plan of the resource redistribution is generated\naccording to this principle. Several specific examples are studied numerically.\nIt elucidates, in particular, the effects of system characteristics such as the\ncity limit capacity in resource delivery, the type of initial resource\nallocation among the cities, the number of cities able to participate in the\nresource redistribution, and the damage level in the affected cities. As far as\nthe uncertainty in evaluating the state of damaged region is concerned, some\nspecific cases were studied. It assumes the initial communication system has\ncrashed and formation of a new one and the resource redistribution proceed\nsynchronously. The obtained results enable us to consider the resource\nredistribution plan governed by the proposed method semi-optimal and rather\nefficient especially under uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 02:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-30"}

While there exist many convenient multivariate distributions such as\nGaussian distribution for continuous data, mixed data with the presence of\ndiscrete variables or a combination of both continuous and discrete variables\nposes new challenges in statistical modeling. In this paper, we propose a\nsemiparametric model named latent Gaussian copula model for binary and mixed\ndata. The observed binary data are assumed to be obtained by dichotomizing a\nlatent variable satisfying the Gaussian copula distribution or the\nnonparanormal distribution. The latent Gaussian model with the assumption that\nthe latent variables are multivariate Gaussian is a special case of the\nproposed model. A novel rank-based approach is proposed for both latent graph\nestimation and latent principal component analysis. Theoretically, the proposed\nmethods achieve the same rates of convergence for both precision matrix\nestimation and eigenvector estimation, as if the latent variables were\nobserved. Under similar conditions, the consistency of graph structure recovery\nand feature selection for leading eigenvectors is established.

This method was\nadumbrated in recent work of Mark Green and Phillip Griffiths.

If the neutron star magnetic field has at least this strength\nat birth, it must decay considerably before jets can be launched in binary\nsystems. We study the magnetic field evolution of a neutron star that accretes\nmatter from the wind of a high-mass stellar companion so that we can constrain\nthe accretion rate and the impurities in the crust, which are necessary\nconditions for jet formation. We solved the induction equation for the\ndiffusion and convection of the neutron star magnetic field confined to the\ncrust, assuming spherical accretion in a simpliflied one-dimensional treatment.\nWe incorporated state-of-the-art microphysics, including consistent thermal\nevolution profiles, and assumed two different neutron star cooling scenarios\nbased on the superfluidity conditions at the core.

The most\ninteresting one is the so-called rho-state, whose light curve shows recurrent\nbursts. This paper presents a model based on Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations\ncontaining two variables: x, linked to the source photon luminosity L detected\nby the MECS, and y related to the mean photon energy. We aim at providing a\nsimple mathematical framework composed by non-linear differential equations\nuseful to predict the observed light curve and the energy lags for the\nrho-state and possibly other classes of the source. We studied the equilibrium\nstate and the stability conditions of this system that includes one external\nparameter, J, that can be considered a function of the disk accretion rate. Our\nwork is based on observations performed with the MECS on board BeppoSAX when\nthe source was in rho and nu mode, respectively. The evolution of the mean\ncount rate and photon energy were derived from a study of the trajectories in\nthe count rate - photon energy plane. Assuming J constant, we found a solution\nthat reproduces the x profile of the rho class bursts and, unexpectedly, we\nfound that y exhibited a time modulation similar to that of the mean energy.\nMoreover, assuming a slowly modulated J the solutions for x quite similar to\nthose observed in the nu class light curves is reproduced. According these\nresults, the outer mass accretion rate is probably responsible for the state\ntransitions, but within the rho-class it is constant. This finding makes\nstronger the heuristic meaning of the non-linear model and suggests a simple\nrelation between the variable x and y. However, how a system of dynamical\nequations can be derived from the complex mathematical apparatus of accretion\ndisks remains to be furtherly explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 06:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-30"}

This view point is mostly present in works about the topology\nof random hyper-surfaces \\cite{ShubSmale93, GayetWelschinger14}. Our first\nresult (lemma \\ref{distgen} page \\pageref{distgen}) is a formula for the\ndistance $\\dist(P,\\Delta)$ of a polynomial to the {\\em real discriminant}\n$\\Delta$, i.e. the set of polynomials with a real singularity on the sphere.\nThis formula is given for any distance coming from a scalar product on the\nvector space of polynomials. Then, we concentrate on Bombieri scalar product\nand its remarkable properties. For instance we establish a combinatoric formula\nfor the scalar product of two products of linear-forms (lemma\n\\ref{scalarlinear} page \\pageref{scalarlinear}) which allows to give a (new ?)\nproof of the invariance of Bombieri's norm by composition with the orthogonal\ngroup. These properties yield a simple formula for the distance in theorem\n\\ref{bombineqdist} page \\pageref{bombineqdist} from which we deduce the\nfollowing inequality: $$\\dist(P, \\Delta) \\leq \\min_{x \\hbox{ critical point of\n} P \\hbox{ on } \\mathcal S^{n-1}} |P(x)|$$ The definition \\ref{maindef} page\n\\pageref{maindef} classifies in two categories the ways to make a polynomial\nsingular to realise the distance to the discriminant. Then, we show, in theorem\n\\ref{extremal} page \\pageref{extremal}, that one of the category is forbidden\nin the case of an {\\em extremal} hyper-surfaces (i.e. with maximal Betti\nnumbers). This implies as a corollary \\ref{bombeqdistbis} (page\n\\pageref{bombeqdistbis}) that the above inequality becomes an equality is that\ncase. The main result in this paper concerns extremal hyper-surfaces $P=0$ that\nmaximise the distance to the discriminant (with $\\|P\\| = 1$). They are very\nremarkable objects which enjoy properties similar to those of quadratic forms:\nthey are linear combination of powers of linear forms $x \\mapsto \\langle x |\nu_i \\rangle^d$ where the vectors $u_i$ are the critical points of $P$ on\n$\\mathcal S^{n-1}$ corresponding to the least positive critical value of $|P|$.\nThis is corollary \\ref{comblinbis} page \\pageref{comblinbis} of a similar\ntheorem \\ref{comblin} page \\pageref{comblin} for all algebraic hyper-surfaces.\nThe next section is devoted to homogeneous polynomials in $2$ variables. We\nprove that a polynomial of degree $d$ with $2d$ regularly spaced roots on the\nunit circle is a local maximum of the distance to the discriminant among\npolynomials with the same norm and number of roots. We conjecture that it is a\nglobal maximum and that the polynomial of degree $d$ with $2r$ regularly spaced\nroots on the unit circle is also a similar global maximum when $d < r \\leq 2d$.\nThis claim is supported by the fact that we were able to prove the consequence\nof this together with corollary \\ref{comblinbis} which yields to interesting\ntrigonometric identities that we could not find somewhere else (proposition\n\\ref{trigo} page \\pageref{trigo}). We also obtain metric information about\nalgebraic hyper-surfaces. First, in the case of extremal hyper-surface, we give\nan upper bound (theorem \\ref{bandwidth} page \\pageref{bandwidth}) on the length\nof an integral curve of the gradient of $P$ in the band where $|P|$ is less\nthat the least positive critical value of $|P|$. Then, a general lower bound on\nthe size and distance between the connected components of the zero locus of $P$\n(corollary \\ref{sphereinside} and theorem \\ref{distancebetween}).

To avoid route flapping, recovery mechanisms may be\ndampened, making adaptation slow. Unstructured overlays have been proposed to\nmitigate the issues of path and performance failures in the Internet by routing\nthrough an indirect-path via overlay peer(s). Choosing alternate-paths in\noverlay networks is a challenging issue. Ensuring both availability and\nperformance guarantees on alternate paths requires aggressive monitoring of all\noverlay paths using active probing; this limits scalability. An alternate\ntechnique to select an overlay-path is to bias its selection based on physical\ndisjointness criteria to bypass the failure on the primary-path. Recently,\nseveral techniques have emerged which can optimize the selection of a\ndisjoint-path without incurring the high costs associated with probing paths.\nIn this paper, we show that using only commodity approaches, i.e. running\ninfrequent traceroutes between overlay hosts, a lot of information can be\nrevealed about the underlying physical path diversity in the overlay network\nwhich can be used to make informed-guesses for alternate-path selection.

It is easy to extend these\nnonconvex penalty functions on singular values of a matrix to enhance low-rank\nmatrix recovery. However, different from convex optimization, solving the\nnonconvex low-rank minimization problem is much more challenging than the\nnonconvex sparse minimization problem. We observe that all the existing\nnonconvex penalty functions are concave and monotonically increasing on\n$[0,\\infty)$. Thus their gradients are decreasing functions. Based on this\nproperty, we propose an Iteratively Reweighted Nuclear Norm (IRNN) algorithm to\nsolve the nonconvex nonsmooth low-rank minimization problem. IRNN iteratively\nsolves a Weighted Singular Value Thresholding (WSVT) problem. By setting the\nweight vector as the gradient of the concave penalty function, the WSVT problem\nhas a closed form solution. In theory, we prove that IRNN decreases the\nobjective function value monotonically, and any limit point is a stationary\npoint. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real images demonstrate\nthat IRNN enhances the low-rank matrix recovery compared with state-of-the-art\nconvex algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 10:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Funding costs and specific close-out procedures at default break the\nbilateral nature of the deal price and render the valuation problem a\nnon-linear and recursive one. CVA and FVA are in general not really additive\nadjustments, and the risk for double counting is concrete. We introduce a new\nadjustment, called a Non-linearity Valuation Adjustment (NVA), to address\ndouble-counting. The theoretical risk free rate disappears from our final\nequations. The framework can be tailored also to CCP trading under initial and\nvariation margins, as explained in detail in Brigo and Pallavicini (2014). In\nparticular, we allow for asymmetric collateral and funding rates, replacement\nclose-out and re-hypothecation. The valuation equation takes the form of a\nbackward stochastic differential equation or semi-linear partial differential\nequation, and can be cast as a set of iterative equations that can be solved by\nleast-squares Monte Carlo. We propose such a simulation algorithm in a case\nstudy involving a generalization of the benchmark model of Black and Scholes\nfor option pricing.

In reality, however, many networks such as Twitter and the World\nWide Web are directed and are composed of both unidirectional and bidirectional\nlinks. Moreover, from choosing a coffee brand to deciding who to vote for in an\nelection, two or more competing opinions often coexist. In response to this\nubiquity of directed networks and the coexistence of two or more opinions in\ndecision-making situations, we study a non-consensus opinion model introduced\nby Shao et al. \\cite{shao2009dynamic} on directed networks. We define\ndirectionality $\\xi$ as the percentage of unidirectional links in a network,\nand we use the linear correlation coefficient $\\rho$ between the indegree and\noutdegree of a node to quantify the relation between the indegree and\noutdegree. We introduce two degree-preserving rewiring approaches which allow\nus to construct directed networks that can have a broad range of possible\ncombinations of directionality $\\xi$ and linear correlation coefficient $\\rho$\nand to study how $\\xi$ and $\\rho$ impact opinion competitions.

We consider different universal ratios\nsuch as $E_N^0/E_3^0$ and $E_N^1/E_N^0$, with $E_N^i$ being the energy of the\nground ($i=0$) and first-excited ($i=1$) state of the system, for $N\\le16$.

To validate our tool, we, using\nnews articles from the New York Times international section, designed and\nconducted a human survey to compare the different summarizers with human\nunderstanding.

Feedback from black holes, supernovae and massive stars may each play\na role by removing matter from the centre of the galaxy on shorter timescales\nthan the dynamical time of the dark matter halo. Our goal in this paper is to\ndetermine constraints on such feedback scenarios based on the observed\nproperties of a set of nearby galaxies.\n  Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of galactic rotation curves,\nvia a method developed in a previous paper, we constrain density profiles and\nan estimated minimum radius for baryon influence, $r_1$, which we couple with a\nfeedback model to give an estimate of the fraction of matter within that radius\nthat must be expelled to produce the presently observed halo profile. We show\nthat in the case of the gas rich dwarf irregular galaxy DDO 154, an outflow\nfrom a central source (e.g. a black hole or star forming region) could produce\nsufficient feedback on the halo without removing the disk gas.\n  We examine the rotation curves of 8 galaxies taken from the THINGS data set\nand determine constraints on the radial density profiles of their dark matter\nhaloes. For some of the galaxies, both cored haloes and cosmological $\\rho\n\\propto r^{-1}$ cusps are excluded. These intermediate central slopes require\nbaryonic feedback to be finely tuned. We also find for galaxies which exhibit\nextended cores in their haloes (e.g. NGC 925), the use of a split power-law\nhalo profile yields models without the unphysical, sharp features seen in\nmodels based on the Einasto profile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 14:51:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In\nthe geometrically frustrated Ising--like magnet Ca3Co2O6, we follow the\ntemporal and spatial evolution of nanoscale magnetic fluctuations firmly\nembedded inside the spin--density--wave magnetic structure. These fluctuations\nare a signature of a competing ferrimagnetic phase with an incommensurability\nthat is different from, but determined by the host. As the temperature is\nlowered, the fluctuations slow down into a super-paramagnetic regime of stable\nspatiotemporal nano-structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 15:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-30"}

Although initially dismissed as a fad, KM continues to be featured in\narticles concerning business productivity and innovation. And yet, clear-cut\nexamples that demonstrate the success of KM are few and far between. A brief\nexamination of the history of KM explores the reasons for this and looks at\nsome of the assumptions about what KM can achieve. A subsequent analysis of the\nexperiences of Infosys with KM shows that for KM to be successful,\norganizational leaders need to engage in a continuous process of modification\nand maintenance. Although KM initiatives can be made to yield worthwhile\nreturns over an extended period, there are often substantial ongoing costs\nassociated with them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 14:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

Although\nelectronic health record (EHR) systems have long been promoted as a\ncost-effective and efficient alternative to this situation, clear-cut evidence\nof their success has not been forthcoming. An examination of some of the\nunderlying problems that prevent EHR systems from delivering the benefits that\ntheir proponents tout identifies four broad objectives - reducing cost,\nreducing errors, improving coordination and improving adherence to standards -\nand shows that they are not always met. The three possible causes for this\nfailure to deliver involve problems with the codification of knowledge, group\nand tacit knowledge, and coordination and communication. There is, however,\nreason to be optimistic that EHR systems can fulfil a healthy part, if not all,\nof their potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 14:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-12"}

From an application\ndeveloper's perspective, it is also important that code can be maintained in a\nportable manner across a range of hardware. Here we present targetDP (target\nData Parallel), a lightweight programming layer that allows the abstraction of\ndata parallelism for applications that employ structured grids. A single source\ncode may be used to target both thread level parallelism (TLP) and instruction\nlevel parallelism (ILP) on either SIMD multi-core CPUs or GPU-accelerated\nplatforms. targetDP is implemented via standard C preprocessor macros and\nlibrary functions, can be added to existing applications incrementally, and can\nbe combined with higher-level paradigms such as MPI. We present CPU and GPU\nperformance results for a benchmark taken from the lattice Boltzmann\napplication that motivated this work. These demonstrate not only performance\nportability, but also the optimisation resulting from the intelligent exposure\nof ILP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 07:51:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2014 13:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-20"}
