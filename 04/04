Lindzen and Nigam (1987) noted that sea level pressure (SLP) gradients\nare proportional to surface temperature gradients if isobaric height (the\nheight where pressure does not vary in the horizontal plane) is constant; their\nown model of low-level circulation assumed that isobaric height in the tropics\nis around 3 km. Recently Bayr and Dommenget (2013) proposed a simple model of\ntemperature-driven air redistribution from which they derived that the isobaric\nheight in the tropics again varies little but occurs higher (at the height of\nthe troposphere). Here investigations show that neither the empirical\nassumption of Lindzen and Nigam (1987) nor the theoretical derivations of Bayr\nand Dommenget (2013) are plausible. Observations show that isobaric height is\ntoo variable to determine a universal spatial or temporal relationship between\nlocal values of air temperature and SLP. Since isobaric height cannot be\ndetermined from independent considerations, the relationship between SLP and\ntemperature is not evidence that differential heating drives low-level\ncirculation. An alternative theory suggests SLP gradients are determined by the\ncondensation of water vapor as moist air converges towards the equator. This\ntheory quantifies the meridional SLP differences observed by season across the\nHadley cells reasonably well. Higher temperature of surface air where SLP is\nlow may be determined by equatorward transport and release of latent heat below\nthe trade wind inversion layer. The relationship between atmospheric\ncirculation and moisture dynamics merits further investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 17:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-04"}

So far, this effect has escaped an experimental\nverification, mainly because of the concomitant appearance of dielectric\nsaturation from which the Hubbard-Onsager decrement cannot be easily separated.\nHere we develop a novel non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation approach\nto determine this decrement accurately for the first time.

In the\nsimplest case, the OPD is equal to the scalar product between the vector\nlinking the two telescopes and the normalized vector pointing toward the star.\nHowever, a too simple interpretation of this scalar product leads to seemingly\nconflicting results, called here \"the baseline paradox\". For micro-arcsecond\naccuracy astrometry, we have to model in full the metrology measurement. It\ninvolves a complex system subject to many optical effects: from pure baseline\nerrors to static, quasi-static and high order optical aberrations. The goal of\nthis paper is to present the strategy used by the \"General Relativity Analysis\nvia VLT InTerferometrY\" instrument (GRAVITY) to minimize the biases introduced\nby these defects. It is possible to give an analytical formula on how the\nbaselines and tip-tilt errors affect the astrometric measurement. This formula\ndepends on the limit-points of three type of baselines: the wide-angle\nbaseline, the narrow-angle baseline, and the imaging baseline. We also,\nnumerically, include non-common path higher-order aberrations, whose amplitude\nwere measured during technical time at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer.\nWe end by simulating the influence of high-order common-path aberrations due to\natmospheric residuals calculated from a Monte-Carlo simulation tool for\nAdaptive optics systems.

Furthermore, the genetic variance that is maintained by\nmutation-selection balance is $2 \\mu/S$ per locus, where $\\mu$ is the mutation\nrate and $S$ the strength of stabilizing selection. In reality, alleles vary in\ntheir effects, making the fitness landscape asymmetric, and complicating\nanalysis of the equilibria. We show that that the resulting genetic variance\ndepends on the fraction of alleles near fixation, which contribute by $2\n\\mu/S$, and on the total mutational effects of alleles that are at intermediate\nfrequency. The interplay between stabilizing selection and mutation leads to a\nsharp transition: alleles with effects smaller than a threshold value of\n$2\\sqrt{\\mu / S}$ remain polymorphic, whereas those with larger effects are\nfixed. The genetic load in equilibrium is less than for traits of equal\neffects, and the fitness equilibria are more similar.

The\nexistence of some mixing of CNO products is clearly confirmed, however the\naccuracy of the data is not sufficient for allowing a test of the significant\ndifferences between different models of rotating stars and the Geneva models.\nWe discuss reasons (for the most part due to observational bias) why part of\nthe observational data points should not be considered for this comparison.\nWhen these observational data points are not considered, the scatter is\nreduced. Finally, the N/C vs N/O plot potentially offers a powerful way for\ndiscriminating blue supergiants before the red supergiant stage from those\nafter it. Also, red supergiants of similar low velocities may exhibit different\nN enrichments, depending on their initial rotation during the main-sequence\nphase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 17:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

Landauer established that information is\nultimately physical, and its manipulation subject to the entropic and energetic\nbounds of thermodynamics. Thus the fundamental costs of biological sensory\nadaptation can be elucidated by tracking how the information the system has\nabout its environment is altered. These bounds are particularly relevant for\nsmall organisms, which unlike everyday computers operate at very low energies.\nIn this paper, we establish a general framework for the thermodynamics of\ninformation processing in sensing.

From the mean period\nand metallicity calculated from the ab-type RR Lyrae, we conclude that Phoenix\nis more likely of intermediate Oosterhoff type; however the morphology of the\nBailey diagram for Phoenix RR Lyraes appears similar to that of an Oosterhoff\ntype I system. Using the RRab stars, we also study the chemical enrichment law\nfor Phoenix. We find that our metallicity distribution is reasonably well\nfitted by a closed-box model. The parameters of this model are compatible with\nthe findings of Hidalgo et al. (2009) further supporting the idea that Phoenix\nappears to have been chemically enriched as a closed-box-like system during the\nearly stage of its formation and evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 18:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-28"}

Here we elucidate the pitfalls of\nusing such regressions, by studying artificial but mathematically convenient\nfitness landscapes. We identify two sources of bias inherent in these\nregression procedures that each tends to under-estimate high fitnesses and\nover-estimate low fitnesses. We characterize these biases for random sampling\nof genotypes, as well as for samples drawn from a population under selection in\nthe Wright-Fisher model of evolutionary dynamics. We show that common measures\nof epistasis, such as the number of monotonically increasing paths between\nancestral and derived genotypes, the prevalence of sign epistasis, and the\nnumber of local fitness maxima, are distorted in the inferred landscape. As a\nresult, the inferred landscape will provide systematically biased predictions\nfor the dynamics of adaptation. We identify the same biases in a computational\nRNA-folding landscape, as well as in regulatory sequence binding data, treated\nwith the same fitting procedure. Finally, we present a method that may\nameliorate these biases in some cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 19:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

Simultaneously with the strategy evolution, players whose current\nutility exceeds a threshold are rewarded by an external link to a player\nbelonging to the other population. Yet as soon as the utility drops below the\nthreshold, the external link is terminated. The rewarding of current\nevolutionary fitness thus introduces a time-varying interdependence between the\ntwo populations. We show that, regardless of the details of the evolutionary\ngame and the interaction structure, the self-organization of fitness and reward\ngives rise to distinguished players that act as strong catalysts of cooperative\nbehavior. However, there also exist critical utility thresholds beyond which\ndistinguished players are no longer able to percolate. The interdependence\nbetween the two populations then vanishes, and cooperators are forced to rely\non traditional network reciprocity alone.

Combined with existing\nmid-IR photometry from Spitzer and observations obtained with LABOCA, the SEDs\nof galaxies in our sample are continuously covered across 3.6-870um. The total\ninfrared luminosities of these RGs are such that they almost all are either\nultra-or hyper-luminous infrared galaxies. We fit the infrared SEDs with a set\nof empirical templates which represent dust heated (1) by a variety of SB and\n(2) by a AGN. We find that the SEDs of RGs require the dust to be heated by\nboth AGN and SB, but the luminosities of these two components are not strongly\ncorrelated. Assuming empirical relations and simple physical assumptions, we\ncalculate the SFR, the black hole mass accretion rate (MdotBH), and the black\nhole mass (MBH) for each RG. We find that the host galaxies and their BHs are\ngrowing extremely rapidly, having SFR~100-5000 Msun/yr and MdotBH~1-100\nMsun/yr. The mean sSFR of RGs at z>2.5 are higher than the sSFR of typical\nstar-forming galaxies over the same redshift range but are similar or perhaps\nlower than the galaxy population for RGs at z<2.5. By comparing the sSFR and\nthe specific black hole mass accretion rate, we conclude that BHs in radio loud\nAGN are already, or soon will be, overly massive compared to their host\ngalaxies in terms of expectations from the local MBH-MGal relation. In order to\n``catch up'' with the BH, the galaxies require about an order-of magnitude more\ntime to grow in mass, at the observed SFRs, compared to the time the BH is\nactively accreting. However, during the current cycle of activity, we argue\nthat this catching-up is likely to be difficult due to the short gas depletion\ntimes. Finally, we speculate on how the host galaxies might grow sufficiently\nin stellar mass to ultimately fall onto the local MBH-MGal relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 20:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In brief, the problem is to\nschedule the use of communication channels to clients. Each client ci is\ncharacterized by an active cycle and a window wi. During the period of time\nthat any given client ci is active, there must be at least one transmission\nfrom ci scheduled in any wi consecutive time slots, but at most one\ntransmission can be carried out in each channel per time slot. The goal is to\nminimize the number of channels used. We extend previous online models, where\ndecisions are permanent, assuming that clients may be reallocated at some cost.\nWe assume that such cost is a constant amount paid per reallocation. That is,\nwe aim to minimize also the number of reallocations. We present three online\nreallocation algorithms for Windows Scheduling. We evaluate experimentally\nthese protocols showing that, in practice, all three achieve constant amortized\nreallocations with close to optimal channel usage. Our simulations also expose\ninteresting trade-offs between reallocations and channel usage.

Can\nit gain an advantage by putting its players in a different order?\n  The first example of this problem in history (to the author's knowledge) was\na match of three horse races between the King of Qi and general Tian Ji, in\nChina, in the fourth century B.C. Tian Ji's protege, Sun Bin, advised the\ngeneral to throw the first race, running his #3 horse against the king's #1,\nand then to race his #1 horse against the king's #2 and his #2 horse against\nthe king's #3. In this way, Tian Ji won the match, 2-1, and Sun Bin ensured his\nreputation as a great strategist.\n  The paper introduces a card-game version of this puzzle, called One Round\nWar, and derives the optimal strategy in case each side has N cards (the\nanalogue of N horses). The problem is recast as a linear assignment problem.\nThe optimal solution involves sacrificing the weakest k cards/horses (for some\nk = k(N)) against the opponent's strongest k in reverse order (weakest vs.\nstrongest), and then playing the remaining N-k cards/horses against the\nopponent's remaining cards in forward order. An exact formula is derived for\nk(N), and asymptotically we show that k(N) ~ sqrt (N ln N/2).\n  Note: This paper proves that the strategy described above is optimal for\nsufficiently large N (e.g., for N greater than 10^7).

In terms of keeping the balance between\nsupply and demand, the usual scheme of supply following load may not be\nappropriate for large penetration levels of uncertain and intermittent\nrenewable supply. In this paper, we focus on an alternative scheme in which the\nload follows the supply, exploiting the flexibility associated with the demand\nside. We consider a model of flexible loads that are to be serviced by\nzero-marginal cost renewable power together with conventional generation if\nnecessary. Each load demands 1 kW for a specified number of time slots within\nan operational period. The flexibility of a load resides in the fact that the\nservice may be delivered over any slots within the operational period. Loads\ntherefore require flexible energy services that are differentiated by the\ndemanded duration. We focus on two problems associated with\ndurations-differentiated loads. The first problem deals with the operational\ndecisions that a supplier has to make to serve a given set of duration\ndifferentiated loads. The second problem focuses on a market implementation for\nduration differentiated services. We give necessary and sufficient conditions\nunder which the available power can service the loads, and we describe an\nalgorithm that constructs an appropriate allocation. In the event the available\nsupply is inadequate, we characterize the minimum amount of power that must be\npurchased to service the loads. Next we consider a forward market where\nconsumers can purchase duration differentiated energy services. We first\ncharacterize social welfare maximizing allocations in this forward market and\nthen show the existence of an efficient competitive equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 22:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-07"}

As in\nearlier work (Coles et al., 2005) the basic phenomenon is the variation in the\nISS caused by the changing transverse velocities of each pulsar, the ionized\ninterstellar medium (IISM), and the Earth. The transverse velocity of the\nbinary system can be determined both by VLBI and timing observations. The\norbital velocity and inclination is almost completely determined from timing\nobservations, but the direction of the orbital angular momentum is not known.\nSince the Earth's velocity is known, and can be compared with the orbital\nvelocity by its effect on the timescale of the ISS, we can determine the\norientation $\\Omega$ of the pulsar orbit with respect to equatorial coordinates\n($\\Omega = 65\\pm2$ deg). We also resolve the ambiguity ($i= 88.7$ or $91.3$\ndeg) in the inclination of the orbit deduced from the measured Shapiro delay by\nour estimate $i=88.1\\pm0.5$ deg. This relies on analysis of the ISS over both\nfrequency and time and provides a model for the location, anisotropy,\nturbulence level and transverse phase gradient of the IISM.

We report our theoretical results on the\ninfluence and stability of a toroidal order in metals on the basis of a\nmicroscopic model. We consider an effective single-band Hubbard-type model with\na site-dependent antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling, which is derived from a\nfour-band tight-binding model including the atomic spin-orbit coupling,\noff-site hybridizations between orbitals with different parities, and\nodd-parity crystalline electric field. For this single-band model on a layered\nhoneycomb lattice, we investigate the electronic structure, magnetotransport,\nand magnetoelectric effect in the toroidal ordered state with a vortex-like\nmagnetic structure. The ferroic order of the microscopic toroidal moments acts\nas an effective gauge field for electrons, which modulates the electronic band\nstructure with a shift of the band bottom in the momentum space. In addition,\nthe site-dependent antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling gives rise to highly\nanisotropic Hall responses. The most salient feature is two different types of\nmagnetoelectric responses: one is a magnetic order with net toroidal\nmagnetization induced by an electric current perpendicular to the planes, and\nthe other is a uniform transverse magnetization induced by an electric current\nwithin the planes. We examine the ground state of the effective model by the\nmean-field approximation, and show that the toroidal order is stabilized by\nstrong electron correlations at low electron density. We also discuss the\ntemperature dependence of the magnetoelectric effects associated with\nspontaneous toroidal ordering. Implications to experiments are also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2014 05:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-05"}

The basic node\nshape function is constructed by extending shape function around a specific\nnode. The MRA endows the proposed element with the resolution level (RL) to\nadjust the element node number, thus modulating structural analysis accuracy\naccordingly. As a result, the traditional 4-node quadrilateral plate element\nand method is a monoresolution one and also a special case of the proposed\nelement and method.

It undergoes an evolution typical of\ntidally stirred dwarf galaxies: it loses mass, the stellar component transforms\nfrom a disk to a spheroid and the rotation of the stars is partially replaced\nby random motions. A tidally induced bar forms at the first pericentre passage\nand survives until the end of the evolution. Fourier decomposition of the\ndistribution of stars reveals that only even modes are significant and preserve\na hierarchy so that the bar mode is always the strongest. They show a\ncharacteristic profile with a maximum, similar to simulated bars forming in\nisolated galaxies and observed bars in real galaxies.

Here we describe a new, independent method which can be applied if\nultra-high energy photons are observed. While such photon-initiated showers\nhave not yet been identified, the capabilities of present and future cosmic-ray\ndetectors may allow their discovery. The method makes use of the geomagnetic\nconversion of UHE photons (preshower effect), which significantly affects the\nsubsequent longitudinal shower development. The conversion probability depends\non photon energy and can be calculated accurately by QED. The comparison of the\nobserved fraction of converted photon events to the expected one allows the\ndetermination of the absolute energy scale of the observed photon air showers\nand, thus, an energy calibration of the air shower experiment. We provide\ndetails of the method and estimate the accuracy that can be reached as a\nfunction of the number of observed photon showers.

A protocol is presented that could\ntransport an atom from one well to the other depending on the motional (Fock)\nstate of the ion within a few ms. This phonon-atom coupling is of interest for\ncreating atom-ion entangled states and may form a building block in\nconstructing a hybrid atom-ion quantum simulator. We also analyze the effect of\nimperfect ground state cooling of the ion and the role of micromotion when the\nion is trapped in a Paul trap.

Recently, global statistical\ninference methods (e.g. direct-coupling analysis, sparse inverse covariance\nestimation) have achieved a breakthrough towards this aim, and their\npredictions have been successfully implemented into tertiary and quaternary\nprotein structure prediction methods. However, due to the discrete nature of\nthe underlying variable (amino-acids), exact inference requires exponential\ntime in the protein length, and efficient approximations are needed for\npractical applicability. Here we propose a very efficient multivariate Gaussian\nmodeling approach as a variant of direct-coupling analysis: the discrete\namino-acid variables are replaced by continuous Gaussian random variables. The\nresulting statistical inference problem is efficiently and exactly solvable. We\nshow that the quality of inference is comparable or superior to the one\nachieved by mean-field approximations to inference with discrete variables, as\ndone by direct-coupling analysis.

The constriction aperture is created by a plane wall and\nspherical obstacle, and emulates the pinching segment in pinched flow\nfractionation devices.

We\nemphasize the importance of anomalous single top plus Higgs production in these\nscenarios, in addition to the more widely studied $t \\to h j$ decays. By\nrecasting existing CMS searches in multilepton and diphoton plus lepton final\nstates, we show that bounds on $tuh$ couplings are improved by a factor of 1.5\nwhen single top plus Higgs production is accounted for.

We address these\nchallenges by introducing an equivalence relation on the CFG paths to partition\nthem into equivalence classes. It is then sufficient to perform analysis on\nthese equivalence classes rather than on the individual paths in a CFG. This\ntechnique has two major advantages: (a) although the number of paths in a CFG\ncan be exponentially large, the essential information to be analyzed is\ncaptured by a small number of equivalence classes, and (b) checking path\nfeasibility becomes simpler. The key challenge is how to efficiently compute\nequivalence classes of paths in a CFG without examining each path in the CFG?\nIn this paper, we present a linear-time algorithm to form equivalence classes\nwithout the need for examination of each path in a CFG. The key to this\nalgorithm is construction of an event-flow graph (EFG), a compact derivative of\nthe CFG, in which each path represents an equivalence class of paths in the\ncorresponding CFG. EFGs are defined with respect to the set of events that are\nin turn defined by the analyzed property. The equivalence classes are thus\nguaranteed to preserve all the event traces in the original CFG. We present an\nempirical evaluation of the Linux kernel (v3.12). The EFGs in our evaluation\nare defined with respect to events of the spin safe-synchronization property.\nEvaluation results show that there are many fewer EFG-based equivalence classes\ncompared to the corresponding number of paths in a CFG. This reduction is close\nto 99% for CFGs with a large number of paths. Moreover, our controlled\nexperiment results show that EFGs are human comprehensible and compact compared\nto their corresponding CFGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2014 15:01:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 03:14:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2015 07:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-10"}

The calculus allows us to analyze the\nstructure of qudit stabilizer quantum mechanics and provides a geometrical\npicture of qudit stabilizer theory using D-toruses, which generalizes the Bloch\nsphere picture for qubit stabilizer quantum mechanics. We also use our\nframework to describe generalizations of Spekkens toy theory to higher\ndimensional systems. This gives a novel proof that qudit stabilizer quantum\nmechanics and Spekkens-Schreiber toy theory for dits are operationally\nequivalent in three dimensions.

With the extensive use\nof a publicly maintained data set that contains information about airports and\nalternative connections between these airports, we empirically reveal that the\nWAN is a redundant and resilient network for long distance air travel, but\notherwise breaks down completely due to removal of short and apparently\ninsignificant connections. These short range connections with moderate number\nof passengers and alternate flights are the connections that keep remote parts\nof the world accessible. It is surprising, insofar as there exists a highly\nresilient and strongly connected core consisting of a small fraction of\nairports (around 2.3%) together with an extremely fragile star-like periphery.\nYet, in spite of their relevance, more than 90% of the world airports are still\ninterconnected upon removal of this core. With standard and unconventional\nremoval measures we compare both empirical and topological perceptions for the\nfragmentation of the world. We identify how the WAN is organized into different\nclasses of clusters based on the physical proximity of airports and analyze the\nconsequence of this fragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2014 12:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-08"}

Vibrating media offer in general a testing\nground for reconciling conflicts between General Relativity and other branches\nof physics; however, constraints are absent in sources like the Weber bar, for\nwhich the standard covariant formalism for elastic bodies can also be applied.\nOur solution method is based on the linearized Einstein equations, but relaxes\nother usual assumptions like far-field approximation, spherical or plane wave\nsymmetry, TT gauge and source without internal interference. The string\nsolution is then adapted to give the radiation field of a transversal Alfven\nwave in a rarefied plasma, where the tension is produced by an external static\nmagnetic field. Like for the string, the field strength turns out to be\nindependent from the frequency. We give a preliminary example of a numerical\nsolution based on parameters referred to Alfven waves in the solar corona.\nFurther astrophysical applications require an extension of the solution\nprocedure to second order in the amplitude, and consideration of border\neffects. Future work will also address numerical and analytical near-field\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2014 09:55:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Jan 2015 19:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-26"}
