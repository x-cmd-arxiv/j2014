Measuring the intrinsic luminosity\nfunction is difficult in practice, due to a multitude of observational and\nsystematic effects. As sample sizes increase and measurement errors drop,\ncharacterizing the systematic effects is becoming more important. It is well\nknown that the continuum emission from the accretion disk of quasars is\nanisotropic --- in part due to its disk-like structure --- but current\nluminosity function calculations effectively assume isotropy over the range of\nunobscured lines of sight. Here, we provide the first steps in characterizing\nthe effect of random quasar orientations and simple models of anisotropy on\nobserved luminosity functions. We find that the effect of orientation is not\ninsignificant and exceeds other potential corrections such as those from\ngravitational lensing of foreground structures. We argue that current\nobservational constraints may overestimate the intrinsic luminosity function by\nas much as a factor of ~2 on the bright end.

We report new lucky imaging observations of this star\nwith the VLT/NACO adaptive optics system in twelve narrow band filters covering\nthe 1.0-4.0 microns wavelength range. These diffraction limited images reveal\nan extended circumstellar dust lane in front of the star, that exhibits a high\nopacity in the J band and becomes translucent in the H and K bands. In the L\nband, extended thermal emission from the dust is detected. We reproduce these\nobservations using Monte-Carlo radiative transfer modeling of a dust disk with\nthe RADMC-3D code. We also present new interferometric observations with the\nVLTI/VINCI and MIDI instruments. We measure in the K band an upper limit to the\nlimb-darkened angular diameter of theta_LD = 17.9 +/- 1.6 mas, converting to a\nmaximum linear radius of R = 123 +/- 14 Rsun. Considering the geometry of the\nextended K band emission in the NACO images, this upper limit is probably close\nto the actual angular diameter of the star. The position of L2 Pup in the\nHerzsprung-Russell diagram indicates that this star has a mass around 2 Msun\nand is probably experiencing an early stage of the asymptotic giant branch. We\ndo not detect any stellar companion of L2 Pup in our adaptive optics and\ninterferometric observations, and we attribute its apparent astrometric wobble\nin the Hipparcos data to variable lighting effects on its circumstellar\nmaterial. We however do not exclude the presence of a binary companion, as the\nlarge loop structure extending to more than 10 AU to the North-East of the disk\nin our L band images may be the result of interaction between the stellar wind\nof L2 Pup and a hidden secondary object. The geometric configuration that we\npropose, with a large dust disk seen almost edge-on, appears particularly\nfavorable to test and develop our understanding of the formation of bipolar\nnebulae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2014 19:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-14"}

A variety of processes\nhave been suggested that could reduce the star formation in such galaxies to\nobserved levels, including quasar mode feedback, virial shock heating, or\ngalactic winds driven by stellar feedback. However, the main quenching\nmechanisms have yet to be identified. Here we study the origin of star\nformation quenching using Argo, a cosmological, hydrodynamical zoom-in\nsimulation that follows the evolution of a massive galaxy at $z\\geq{}2$. This\nsimulation adopts the same sub-grid recipes of the Eris simulations, which have\nbeen shown to form realistic disk galaxies, and, in one version, adopts also a\nmass and spatial resolution identical to Eris. The resulting galaxy has\nproperties consistent with those of observed, massive (M_* ~ 1e11 M_sun)\ngalaxies at z~2 and with abundance matching predictions. Our models do not\ninclude AGN feedback indicating that supermassive black holes likely play a\nsubordinate role in determining masses and sizes of massive galaxies at high z.\nThe specific star formation rate (sSFR) of the simulated galaxy matches the\nobserved M_* - sSFR relation at early times. This period of smooth stellar mass\ngrowth comes to a sudden halt at z=3.5 when the sSFR drops by almost an order\nof magnitude within a few hundred Myr. The suppression is initiated by a\nleveling off and a subsequent reduction of the cool gas accretion rate onto the\ngalaxy, and not by feedback processes. This \"cosmological starvation\" occurs as\nthe parent dark matter halo switches from a fast collapsing mode to a slow\naccretion mode. Additional mechanisms, such as perhaps radio mode feedback from\nan AGN, are needed to quench any residual star formation of the galaxy and to\nmaintain a low sSFR until the present time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2014 20:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 17:07:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Genome-wide DNA\nmethylation assays have become increasingly common, and recently distinct\nstages across differentiating cellular lineages have been assayed. How- ever,\ncurrent methods for modeling methylation dynamics do not account for the\ndependency structure between precursor and dependent cell types. We developed a\ncontinuous-time Markov chain approach, based on the observation that changes in\nmethylation state over tissue differentiation can be modeled similarly to DNA\nnucleotide changes over evolutionary time. This model explicitly takes\nprecursor to descendant relationships into account and enables inference of CpG\nmethylation dynamics. To illustrate our method, we analyzed a high-resolution\nmethylation map of the differentiation of mouse stem cells into several blood\ncell types. Our model can successfully infer unobserved CpG methylation states\nfrom observations at the same sites in related cell types (90% correct), and\nthis approach more accurately reconstructs missing data than imputation based\non neighboring CpGs (84% correct).

To date, no one has created an\nalgorithm that determines a minimal pagination break point based on the content\nof the article. Existing approaches for automatic multi-article layout focus\nexclusively on maximizing content (number of articles) and optimizing aesthetic\npresentation (e.g., spacing between articles). However, disregarding the\nsemantic information within the article can lead to overly aggressive cutting,\nthereby eliminating key content and potentially confusing the reader, or\nsetting too generous of a break point, thereby leaving in superfluous content\nand making automatic layout more difficult. This is one of the remaining\nchallenges on the path from manual layouts to fully automated processes that\nstill ensure article content quality. In this work, we present a new approach\nto calculating a document minimal break point for the task of pagination. Our\napproach uses a statistical language model to predict minimal break points\nbased on the semantic content of an article. We then compare 4 novel candidate\napproaches, and 4 baselines (currently in use by layout algorithms). Results\nfrom this experiment show that one of our approaches strongly outperforms the\nbaselines and alternatives. Results from a second study suggest that humans are\nnot able to agree on a single \"best\" break point. Therefore, this work shows\nthat a semantic-based lower bound break point prediction is necessary for ideal\nautomated document synthesis within a real-world context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2014 21:50:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-15"}

The nonnegative rank\nhas received a lot of attention recently due to its application in\noptimization, probability and communication complexity. In this paper we study\na class of atomic rank functions defined on a convex cone which generalize\nseveral notions of \"positive\" ranks such as nonnegative rank or cp-rank (for\ncompletely positive matrices). The main contribution of the paper is a new\nmethod to obtain lower bounds for such ranks which improve on previously known\nbounds. Additionally the bounds we propose can be computed by semidefinite\nprogramming. The idea of the lower bound relies on an atomic norm approach\nwhere the atoms are self-scaled according to the vector (or matrix, in the case\nof nonnegative rank) of interest. This results in a lower bound that is\ninvariant under scaling and that is at least as good as other existing\nnorm-based bounds.\n  We mainly focus our attention on the two important cases of nonnegative rank\nand cp-rank where our bounds satisfying interesting properties: For the\nnonnegative rank we show that our lower bound can be interpreted as a\nnon-combinatorial version of the fractional rectangle cover number, while the\nsum-of-squares relaxation is closely related to the Lov\\'asz theta number of\nthe rectangle graph of the matrix. We also prove that the lower bound inherits\nmany of the structural properties satisfied by the nonnegative rank such as\ninvariance under diagonal scaling, subadditivity, etc. We also apply our method\nto obtain lower bounds on the cp-rank for completely positive matrices. In this\ncase we prove that our lower bound is always greater than or equal the plain\nrank lower bound, and we show that it has interesting connections with\ncombinatorial lower bounds based on edge-clique cover number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2014 22:38:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

We found that the NLFFF never shows the drastic\ndynamics seen in observations, i.e., it is in stable state against the\nperturbations. On the other hand, the MHD simulation shows that when the\nstrongly twisted lines are formed at close to the neutral line, which are\nproduced via tether-cutting reconnection in the twisted lines of the NLFFF,\nconsequently they erupt away from the solar surface via the complicated\nreconnection.

Here, we incorporated literature values\nfor properties of myosin II isoforms into a cross-bridge model. Similar actin\ngliding speeds and force-velocity curves expected from previous experiments\nwere observed. Motor force output on an elastic load was regulated by two\ntimescales--that of their attachment to F-actin, which varied sharply with the\nensemble size, motor duty ratio, and external load, and that of force build up,\nwhich scaled with ensemble stall force, gliding speed, and load stiffness.\nWhile such regulation did not require force-dependent kinetics, the myosin\ncatch bond produced positive feedback between attachment time and force to\ntrigger switch-like transitions from short attachments and small forces to high\nforce-generating runs at threshold parameter values. Parameters representing\nskeletal muscle myosin, non-muscle myosin IIB, and non-muscle myosin IIA\nrevealed distinct regimes of behavior respectively: (1) large assemblies of\nfast, low-duty ratio motors rapidly build stable forces over a large range of\nenvironmental stiffness, (2) ensembles of slow, high-duty ratio motors serve as\nhigh-affinity cross-links with force build-up times that exceed physiological\ntimescales, and (3) small assemblies of low-duty ratio motors operating at\nintermediate speeds may respond sharply to changes in mechanical context--at\nlow forces or stiffness, they serve as low affinity cross-links but they can\ntransition to effective force production via the positive feedback mechanism\ndescribed above.

After clearly stating the problem, our argument is\ndeveloped in three stages. First, we consider the phenomenon of\nenvironment-induced decoherence as an example of the case in which the\nsubsystems interact with each other; we show that decoherence does not solve\nthe measurement problem precisely because the reduced state of the measuring\napparatus is not its quantum state. Second, the non-interacting case is\nillustrated in the context of no-collapse interpretations, in which we show\nthat certain well-known experimental results cannot be accounted for due to the\nfact that the reduced states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus\nare conceived as their quantum states.

A fundamental and essential\noperation for SUs is to establish communication through choosing a common\nchannel at the same time slot, which is referred to as rendezvous problem. In\nthis paper, we study strategies to achieve fast rendezvous for two secondary\nusers.\n  The channel availability for secondary nodes is subject to temporal and\nspatial variation. Moreover, in a distributed system, one user is oblivious of\nthe other user's channel status. Therefore, a fast rendezvous is not trivial.\nRecently, a number of rendezvous strategies have been proposed for different\nsystem settings, but rarely have they taken the temporal variation of the\nchannels into account. In this work, we first derive a time-adaptive strategy\nwith optimal expected time-to-rendezvous (TTR) for synchronous systems in\nstable environments, where channel availability is assumed to be static over\ntime. Next, in dynamic environments, which better represent temporally dynamic\nchannel availability in CRNs, we first derive optimal strategies for two\nspecial cases, and then prove that our strategy is still asymptotically optimal\nin general dynamic cases.\n  Numerous simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of our\nstrategies, and validate the theoretical analysis. The impacts of different\nparameters on the TTR are also investigated, such as the number of channels,\nthe channel open possibilities, the extent of the environment being dynamic,\nand the existence of an intruder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Apr 2014 08:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-15"}

An interesting feature of this\napproach is that, contrary to the Klauder-Perelomov and Barut-Girardello\napproaches, it does not require the existence of dynamical symmetries\nassociated with the system under consideration. These states admit a resolution\nof the identity through positive definite measures on the complex plane. We\nhave shown that the realization of these states for different values of the\ndeformation parameters leads to the well-known Klauder-Perelomov and\nBarut-Girardello CSs associated with the $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. This is why we\ncall them the generalized $su(1,1)$ CSs for the PHO. Finally, study of some\nstatistical characters such as squeezing, anti-bunching effect and\nsub-Poissonian statistics reveals that the constructed GCSs have indeed\nnonclassical features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Apr 2014 10:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-15"}

The\nsimulations predict a slightly steeper wavefront towards East than towards\nWest, but this asymmetry is negligible against the measurement uncertainties of\nLOPES. At axis distances $\\gtrsim 50\\,$m, the wavefront can be approximated by\na simple cone. According to the simulations, the cone angle is clearly\ncorrelated with the shower maximum. Thus, we confirm earlier predictions that\narrival time measurements can be used to study the longitudinal shower\ndevelopment, but now using a realistic wavefront. Moreover, we show that the\nhyperbolic wavefront is compatible with our measurement, and we present several\nexperimental indications that the cone angle is indeed sensitive to the shower\ndevelopment. Consequently, the wavefront can be used to statistically study the\nprimary composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. At LOPES, the\nexperimentally achieved precision for the shower maximum is limited by\nmeasurement uncertainties to approximately $140\\,$g/cm$^2$. But the simulations\nindicate that under better conditions this method might yield an accuracy for\nthe atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, $X_\\mathrm{max}$, better than\n$30\\,$g/cm$^2$. This would be competitive with the established air-fluorescence\nand air-Cherenkov techniques, where the radio technique offers the advantage of\na significantly higher duty-cycle. Finally, the hyperbolic wavefront can be\nused to reconstruct the shower geometry more accurately, which potentially\nallows a better reconstruction of all other shower parameters, too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Apr 2014 12:20:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2014 08:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-17"}

The\ngreat variety of video applications and devices results in numerous compression\nspecifications. Specifically, there is a diversity of frame-rates and\nbit-rates. In this paper, we study the effect of frame-rate and compression\nbit-rate on block-based ME and MC as commonly utilized in inter-frame coding\nand frame-rate up conversion (FRUC). This joint examination yields a\ncomprehensive foundation for comparing MC procedures in coding and FRUC. First,\nthe video signal is modeled as a noisy translational motion of an image. Then,\nwe theoretically model the motion-compensated prediction of an available and\nabsent frames as in coding and FRUC applications, respectively. The theoretic\nMC-prediction error is further analyzed and its autocorrelation function is\ncalculated for coding and FRUC applications. We show a linear relation between\nthe variance of the MC-prediction error and temporal-distance. While the\naffecting distance in MC-coding is between the predicted and reference frames,\nMC-FRUC is affected by the distance between the available frames used for the\ninterpolation. Moreover, the dependency in temporal-distance implies an inverse\neffect of the frame-rate. FRUC performance analysis considers the prediction\nerror variance, since it equals to the mean-squared-error of the interpolation.\nHowever, MC-coding analysis requires the entire autocorrelation function of the\nerror; hence, analytic simplicity is beneficial.

We show that,\nusing this model, the cusp/core problem, the missing satellite problem (MSP),\nthe Too Big to Fail (TBTF) problem, and the angular momentum catastrophe can be\nreconciled with observations. Concerning the cusp/core problem, the interaction\namong dark matter (DM) and baryonic clumps of 1% the mass of the halo, through\ndynamical friction (DF), is able to flatten the inner cusp of the density\nprofiles. We moreover assume that haloes form primarily through quiescent\naccretion, in agreement with the spherical collapse model (SCM)-secondary\ninfall model (SIM) prescriptions. The results of this paper follow from the two\nassumptions above. Concerning the MSP and TBTF problem, applying to the Via\nLactea II (VL2) subhaloes a series of corrections similar to those of Brooks et\nal. (2013), namely applying a Zolotov et al. (2012)-like correction obtained\nwith our model, and further correcting for the UV heating and tidal stripping,\nwe obtain that the number of massive, luminous satellites is in agreement with\nthe number observed in the MW. The model also produces an angular momentum\ndistribution in agreement with observations, that is with the distribution of\nthe angular spin parameter and angular momentum of the dwarfs studied by van\nden Bosch, Burkert, & Swaters (2001). In conclusion, the small scale problems\nof the CDM model can all be solved by introducing baryon physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2014 19:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-06"}

In educational and\npsychological testing, percentiles are already used widely as a standard to\nevaluate an individual's test scores - intelligence tests for example - by\ncomparing them with the percentiles of a calibrated sample. Percentiles, or\npercentile rank classes, are also a very suitable method for bibliometrics to\nnormalize citations of publications in terms of the subject category and the\npublication year and, unlike the mean-based indicators (the relative citation\nrates), percentiles are scarcely affected by skewed distributions of citations.\nThe percentile of a certain publication provides information about the citation\nimpact this publication has achieved in comparison to other similar\npublications in the same subject category and publication year. Analyses of\npercentiles, however, have not always been presented in the most effective and\nmeaningful way.

The\nclasses suggest numerous families of specific field configurations with\ndifferent physical properties generated by appropriate choices of the\ntransformation of the independent variable, real or complex. There are many\nfamilies of models with constant detuning or constant amplitude, numerous\nclasses of chirped pulses of controllable amplitude and/or detuning, families\nof models with double or multiple (periodic) crossings, periodic amplitude\nmodulation field configurations, etc. We present several families of\nconstant-detuning field configurations the members of which are symmetric or\nasymmetric two-peak finite-area pulses with controllable distance between the\npeaks and controllable amplitude of each of the peaks. We show that the edge\nshapes, the distance between the peaks as well as the amplitude of the peaks\nare controlled almost independently, by different parameters. We identify the\nparameters controlling each of the mentioned features and discuss other basic\nproperties of pulse shapes. We show that the pulse edges may become step-wise\nfunctions and determine the positions of the limiting vertical-wall edges. We\nshow that the pulse width is controlled by only two of the involved parameters.\nFor some values of these parameters the pulse width diverges and for some other\nvalues the pulses become infinitely narrow. We show that the effect of the two\nmentioned parameters is almost similar, that is, both parameters are able to\nindependently produce pulses of almost the same shape and width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Apr 2014 05:09:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 22:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-12"}
