Very recently, it was suggested that additional\nrelativistic degrees of freedom beyond the three active neutrinos and photons\ncan help to relieve this tension: the data favor an effective number of light\nneutrino species N_{eff} = 3.86 \\pm 0.25. Since the BICEP2 ratio implies the\nenergy scale of inflation (V_*^{1/4} \\sim 2 \\times 10^{16} GeV) is comparable\nto the grand unification scale, in this paper we investigate whether we can\naccommodate the required N_{eff} with three right-handed (partners of the\nleft-handed standard model) neutrinos living in the fundamental representation\nof a grand unified exceptional E_6 group. We show that the superweak\ninteractions of these Dirac states (through their coupling to a TeV-scale Z'\ngauge boson) lead to decoupling of right-handed neutrino just above the QCD\ncross over transition: 175 MeV < T_{\\nu_R}^{dec} < 250 MeV. For decoupling in\nthis transition region, the contribution of the three right-handed neutrinos to\nN_{eff} is suppressed by heating of the left-handed neutrinos (and photons).\nConsistency (within 1\\sigma) with the favored N_{eff} is achieved for 4.5 TeV <\nM_{Z'} < 7.5 TeV. The model is fully predictive and can be confronted with\nfuture data from LHC14.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2014 16:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Although centralization is a convenient way for implementing OSNs, it\nhas several well known drawbacks. Chief among them are the risks they pose to\nthe security and privacy of the information maintained by the OSN; and the loss\nof control over the information contributed by individual members.\n  These concerns prompted several attempts to create decentralized OSNs, or\nDOSNs. The basic idea underlying these attempts, is that each member of a\nsocial network keeps its data under its own control, instead of surrendering it\nto a central host; providing access to it to other members of the OSN according\nto its own access-control policy. Unfortunately all existing DOSN projects have\na very serious limitation. Namely, they are unable to subject the membership of\na DOSN, and the interaction between its members, to any global policy.\n  We adopt the decentralization idea underlying DOSNs, complementing it with a\nmeans for specifying and enforcing a wide range of policies over the membership\nof a social community, and over the interaction between its disparate\ndistributed members.

However the APECS method alone cannot eliminate the background\ndue to valence band photoemission processes in which the initial photon energy\nis shared by two or more electrons and one of the electrons is in the energy\nrange of the core level photoemission peak. Here we describe an experimental\nmethod to determine the contributions from these background processes and apply\nthis method in the case of Copper M3VV Auger spectrum obtained in coincidence\nwith the 3p3/2 photoemission peak. A beam of 200 eV photons was incident on a\nCu(100) sample and a series of coincidence measurements were performed using a\nspectrometer equipped with two cylindrical mirror analyzers (CMAs). One CMA was\nset at series of fixed energies that ranged between the energy of the core and\nthe VB peaks. The other CMA was scanned over a range corresponding to electrons\nleaving the surface between 0eV and 70eV. The set of measured spectra were then\nfit to a parameterized function which was extrapolated to determine the\nbackground in the APECS spectra due to multi-electron and inelastic VB\nphotoemission processes. The extrapolated background was subtracted from the\nAPECS spectrum to obtain the spectrum of electrons emitted solely as the result\nof the Auger process. A comparison of the coincidence spectrum with the same\nspectrum with background removed shows that in the case of Cu M3VV the\nbackground due to the inelastic scattering of VB electrons is negligible in the\nregion of the Auger peak but is more than half the total signal down in the low\nenergy tail of the Auger peak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2014 19:29:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 May 2014 15:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-29"}

In\nparticular, we analyze and compare two analytic approaches to these formulas.\nThe Ionel-Parker formula contains two unique features, rim tori refinements of\nrelative invariants and the so-called S-matrix, which have been a mystery in\nGW-theory over the past decade. We explain why the latter, which appears due to\nimprecise reasoning, should not be present and how the former should be\ninterpreted. While the gluing argument in the IP work attempts to address all\nof the issues relevant to certain \"semi-positive\" cases, it contains several\nhighly technical, but crucial, mistakes, which invalidate it and thus the whole\npaper almost completely. The SFT type idea behind the Li-Ruan approach has the\npotential of avoiding many issues with the degeneration of the metric on the\ntarget occurring in the IP approach. Unfortunately, the LR paper is vague about\nthe key notions and aspects of the setup, including the definition of relative\nstable maps, and does not contain even a description of the local structure of\nthe relative moduli space or an attempt at a complete proof of any major\nstatement. The only technical arguments in this paper concern fairly minor\npoints and are either incorrect or unnecessary. Neither of the two papers even\nconsiders gluing stable maps with extra rubber structure, which is necessary\nfor defining the relevant invariants outside of a relatively narrow collection\nof \"semi-positive\" cases. In this manuscript, we re-formulate the (numerical)\nsymplectic sum formula, describe the issues arising in both approaches, and\nexplain how the Li-Ruan SFT type idea can be used to address them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2014 19:29:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Dec 2014 20:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-30"}

Typically there is a well-defined\nnotion of distance between pairs of objects, and traditional approaches such as\nprincipal component analysis or multi-dimensional scaling are used to place the\nobjects as points in 2D space, so that similar objects are close to each other.\nIn another typical setting, the dataset is visualized as a network graph, where\nrelated nodes are connected by links. More recently, datasets are also\nvisualized as maps, where in addition to nodes and links, there is an explicit\nrepresentation of groups and clusters. We consider these three Techniques,\ncharacterized by a progressive increase of the amount of encoded information:\nnode diagrams, node-link diagrams and node-link-group diagrams. We assess these\nthree types of diagrams with a controlled experiment that covers nine different\ntasks falling broadly in three categories: node-based tasks, network-based\ntasks and group-based tasks. Our findings indicate that adding links, or links\nand group representations, does not negatively impact performance (time and\naccuracy) of node-based tasks. Similarly, adding group representations does not\nnegatively impact the performance of network-based tasks. Node-link-group\ndiagrams outperform the others on group-based tasks.

In a separate line of\nresearch, the Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) framework has been\ndeveloped over the last decade by Arnold, Falk and Winther and others as a way\nto exploit the observation that mixed variational problems can be posed on a\nHilbert complex, and Galerkin-type mixed methods can be obtained by solving\nfinite dimensional subproblems. In 2011, Holst and Stern merged these two lines\nof research by developing a framework for variational crimes in abstract\nHilbert complexes, allowing for application of the FEEC framework to problems\nthat violate the subcomplex assumption of Arnold, Falk and Winther. When\napplied to Euclidean hypersurfaces, this new framework recovers the original a\npriori results and extends the theory to problems posed on surfaces of\narbitrary dimensions.

By interpreting controller synthesis (in a model matching\nsetup) as the solution of a particular linear inverse problem, we view the\nchallenge of obtaining a controller with a desired architecture as one of\nfinding a structured solution to an inverse problem.

In this paper we\ndescribe three alternative parallel algorithms for adaptive indexing, including\na second variant of a parallel standard cracking algorithm. Additionally, we\ndescribe a hybrid parallel sorting algorithm, and a NUMA-aware method based on\nsorting. We then thoroughly compare all these algorithms experimentally; along\na variant of a recently published parallel version of radix sort. Parallel\nsorting algorithms serve as a realistic baseline for multi-threaded adaptive\nindexing techniques. In total we experimentally compare seven parallel\nalgorithms.

For each filter family, the\nspectro-temporal receptive fields can be either separable over the\ntime-frequency domain or be adapted to local glissando transformations that\nrepresent variations in logarithmic frequencies over time. Within each domain\nof either non-causal or time-causal time, these receptive field families are\nderived by uniqueness from the assumptions.\n  It is demonstrated how the presented framework allows for computation of\nbasic auditory features for audio processing and that it leads to predictions\nabout auditory receptive fields with good qualitative similarity to biological\nreceptive fields measured in the inferior colliculus (ICC) and primary auditory\ncortex (A1) of mammals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 08:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

The decay from outburst\nto quiescence is very fast, with an exponential decay characteristic time scale\nof ~2 d.

The comparison with the only other\nwell-monitored outburst from Aql X-1 (1997) is tail-telling.

In\naddition, for both outbursts, the decay profiles are also very similar, likely\nresulting from the shut-off of the accretion process onto the neutron star\nsurface. Finally, the quiescent neutron star temperatures at the end of the\noutbursts are well consistent with one another, suggesting a hot neutron star\ncore dominating the thermal balance. Small differences in the quiescent X-ray\nluminosity among the two outbursts can be attributed to a different level of\nthe power law component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 09:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

However, the spatial variation of the energy field\ncan lead to fluctuations in power supplied to the network and thereby affects\nits coverage. This warrants research on quantifying the aforementioned negative\neffect and countermeasure techniques, motivating the current work. First, a\nnovel energy field model is presented, in which fixed maximum energy intensity\n$\\gamma$ occurs at Poisson distributed locations, called energy centers. The\nintensities fall off from the centers following an exponential decay function\nof squared distance and the energy intensity at an arbitrary location is given\nby the decayed intensity from the nearest energy center. The product between\nthe energy center density and the exponential rate of the decay function,\ndenoted as $\\psi$, is shown to determine the energy field distribution. Next,\nthe paper considers a cellular downlink network powered by harvesting energy\nfrom the energy field and analyzes its network coverage. For the case of\nharvesters deployed at the same sites as base stations (BSs), as $\\gamma$\nincreases, the mobile outage probability is shown to scale as $(c\n\\gamma^{-\\pi\\psi}+p)$, where $p$ is the outage probability corresponding to a\nflat energy field and $c$ a constant. Subsequently, a simple scheme is proposed\nfor counteracting the energy randomness by spatial averaging.

Evaporation rates have been calculated so far\nonly for species containing up to a few 100 C atoms, whereas interstellar PAH\nclusters could contain up to ~1000 C atoms. We present a method that\ngeneralises the calculation of the statistical evaporation rate of large PAH\nclusters and provides rates for species containing up to ~1000 C-atoms. The\nevaporation of non-rotating neutral homo-molecular PAH clusters containing up\nto 12 molecules from a family of highly symmetric compact PAHs is studied.\nStatistical calculations were performed and completed with molecular dynamics\nsimulations at high internal energies to provide absolute values for the\nevaporation rate and distributions of kinetic energy released. The calculations\nused explicit atom-atom Lennard-Jones potentials in the rigid molecule\napproximation. A new method is proposed to take both inter- and intra-molecular\nvibrations into account. Without any parameter adjustment, the calculated\nevaporation rates agree well with available experimental data. We find that the\nnon-rotation assumption has a limited impact on the evaporation rates. The\nphotostability of PAH clusters increases dramatically with the size of\nmolecules in the clusters, and to a lesser extent with the number of molecules\nin the clusters. For values of the UV radiation field that are typical of the\nregions where evaporating very small grains are observed, the smallest clusters\nin this study (~50 C-atoms) are found to be quickly photo-evaporated, whereas\nthe largest clusters (~1000 C-atoms) are photostable.

The secondary star in this double system is known to host a\ntransiting giant planet while no planets have yet been detected around the\nprimary star. The derived metallicities ([Fe/H]) of the primary and secondary\nstars are identical within the errors: $0.146 \\pm 0.014$ dex ($\\sigma$ = 0.033\ndex) and $0.155 \\pm 0.007$ dex ($\\sigma$ = 0.023 dex), respectively. Extremely\nprecise differential abundance ratios of 23 elements have been measured (mean\nerror of $\\sigma$([X/Fe]) = 0.013 dex) and are found to be indistinguishable\nbetween the two stars: $\\Delta$[X/Fe] (secondary - primary) = $+0.001 \\pm\n0.006$ dex ($\\sigma$ = 0.008 dex). The striking similarity in the chemical\ncomposition of the two stellar components in HAT-P-1 is contrary to the\npossible 0.04 dex level difference seen in 16 Cyg A+B, which also hosts a giant\nplanet, at least 3 times more massive than the one around HAT-P-1 secondary\nstar. We conclude that the presence of giant planets does not necessarily imply\ndifferences in the chemical compositions of the host stars. The elemental\nabundances of each star in HAT-P-1 relative to the Sun show an identical,\npositive correlation with the condensation temperature of the elements; their\nabundance patterns are thus very similar to those observed in the majority of\nsolar twins. In view of the Melendez et al. (2009)'s interpretation of the\npeculiar solar abundance pattern, we conclude that HAT-P-1 experienced less\nefficient formation of terrestrial planets than the Sun. This is in line with\nthe expectation that the presence of close-in giant planets preventing the\nformation or survival of terrestrial planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 12:59:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 May 2014 17:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-22"}

If the source is located at a distance of 1.5 kpc (as\nsuggested in the literature), this would imply a luminosity of ~8x10^29 erg\ns-1, making it the faintest detected quiescent black hole LMXB. This would also\nimply that there is no indication of a reversal in the quiescence X-ray\nluminosity versus orbital period diagram down to 2.8 hr, as has been predicted\ntheoretically and recently supported by the detection of the 2.4 hr orbital\nperiod black hole MAXI J1659-152 at a 0.5-10 keV X-ray luminosity of ~ 1.2 x\n10^31 erg s-1. However, there is considerable uncertainty in the distance of\nSwift J1357.2-0933 and it may be as distant as 6 kpc.

We also detected the source in optical at r' ~22.3 mag with the\nLiverpool telescope, simultaneously to our X-ray observation.

More technically, during a bubble phase,\nthe price follows a faster-than-exponential power law growth process, often\naccompanied by log-periodic oscillations. This dynamic ends abruptly in a\nchange of regime that may be a crash or a substantial correction. Because they\nleave such specific traces, bubbles may be recognised in advance, that is,\nbefore they burst. In this paper, we will explain the mechanism behind\nfinancial bubbles in an intuitive way. We will show how the log-periodic power\nlaw emerges spontaneously from the complex system that financial markets are,\nas a consequence of feedback mechanisms, hierarchical structure and specific\ntrading dynamics and investment styles. We argue that the risk of a major\ncorrection, or even a crash, becomes substantial when a bubble develops towards\nmaturity, and that it is therefore very important to find evidence of bubbles\nand to follow their development from as early a stage as possible. The tools\nthat are explained in this paper actually serve that purpose.

One of these ideas is the \"neutral solar\nwind\" scenario, which identifies the source particles as pickup protons in the\nlocal interstellar medium originating in solar wind charge-exchange\ninteractions. This scenario has been thought to require unrealistically weak\npitch-angle scattering of the pickup protons to explain the narrow structure.\nRecently, Schwadron & McComas (2013) suggested that this structure could result\nfrom a spatial retention of the pickup protons, rather than from a restricted\npitch-angle distribution. Here, we present a physically motivated, quantitative\nmechanism to produce such a spatial configuration. This mechanism is based on\nthe \"dominant turbulence\" assumption, which can be applied where the production\nof new pickup protons is slow, and has been used to successfully explain the\nlevel of turbulent heating observed in the outer solar wind. This formalism\npredicts a pickup isotropization process which adds or subtracts energy from\nthe ambient turbulent fluctuations, depending on the initial pitch angle of the\npickup protons. We show that a simple model of this process can yield a ribbon\nstructure in qualitative agreement with the observations. The results of this\nsimple model are not yet quantitatively satisfactory, but we suggest several\nimprovements which may reduce the quantitative discrepancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 15:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

These forces slide adjacent microtubule doublets within the\naxoneme, the motile cytoskeletal structure. To create regular, oscilla- tory\nbeating patterns, the activities of the axonemal dyneins must be coordinated\nboth spatially and temporally. It is thought that coordination is mediated by\nstresses or strains, which build up within the moving axoneme, and somehow\nregulate dynein activity. While experimenting with axonemes subjected to mild\nproteolysis, we observed pairs of doublets associate with each other and form\nbends with almost constant curvature. By model- ing the statics of a pair of\nfilaments, we show that the activity of the motors concentrates at the distal\ntips of the doublets. Furthermore, we show that this distribution of motor\nactivity accords with models in which curvature, or curvature-induced normal\nforces, regulates the activity of the motors. These observations, together with\nour theoretical analysis, provide evidence that dynein activity can be\nregulated by curvature or normal forces, which may, therefore, play a role in\ncoordinating the beating of cilia and flagella.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 15:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Most\ncurrent and commonly used risk prediction models have been built from carefully\nselected epidemiological cohorts. However, the homogeneity and limited size of\nsuch cohorts restricts the predictive power and generalizability of these risk\nmodels to other populations. Electronic health data (EHD) from large health\ncare systems provide access to data on large, heterogeneous, and\ncontemporaneous patient populations. The unique features and challenges of EHD,\nincluding missing risk factor information, non-linear relationships between\nrisk factors and cardiovascular event outcomes, and differing effects from\ndifferent patient subgroups, demand novel machine learning approaches to risk\nmodel development. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach based\non Bayesian networks trained on EHD to predict the probability of having a\ncardiovascular event within five years. In such data, event status may be\nunknown for some individuals as the event time is right-censored due to\ndisenrollment and incomplete follow-up. Since many traditional data mining\nmethods are not well-suited for such data, we describe how to modify both\nmodelling and assessment techniques to account for censored observation times.\nWe show that our approach can lead to better predictive performance than the\nCox proportional hazards model (i.e., a regression-based approach commonly used\nfor censored, time-to-event data) or a Bayesian network with {\\em{ad hoc}}\napproaches to right-censoring.

Typical recommendation\nalgorithms were built on the following bases: (1) assuming users and items are\nIID, namely independent and identically distributed, and (2) focusing on\nspecific aspects such as user preferences or contents. In reality, complex\nrecommendation tasks involve and request (1) personalized outcomes to tailor\nheterogeneous subjective preferences; and (2) explicit and implicit objective\ncoupling relationships between users, items, and ratings to be considered as\nintrinsic forces driving preferences. This inevitably involves the non-IID\ncomplexity and the need of combining subjective preference with objective\ncouplings hidden in recommendation applications. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel generic coupled matrix factorization (CMF) model by incorporating non-IID\ncoupling relations between users and items.

To solve\nthese challenges, the objective item attributes are incorporated as\ncomplementary information.
