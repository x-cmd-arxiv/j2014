In\nthis paper, an exact, static, spherically symmetric solution of the classical\nequations is derived. I show that when the Schwarzchild radius to distance\nratio is at post-Newtonian order the theory agrees with general relativity for\nall parameters but that, once the ratio becomes closer to unity, they differ.\nAt the Schwarzchild radius from a black hole singularity, general relativity\npredicts an event horizon, which has become a controversial topic in quantum\ngravity because of information preservation issues. In the De Sitter theory I\nshow, however, that time-like escape paths exist for any mass black hole until\nthe singularity itself is reached. Since an event horizon has never been\ndirectly observed and there is currently no observation on which the two\ntheories disagree, this provides a powerful test of the De Sitter theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 17:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-18"}

Much attention has been devoted lately to\nquantile-based spectral methods that go beyond covariance-based serial\ndependence features. At the same time, covariance-based methods relaxing\nstationarity into much weaker {\\it local stationarity} conditions have been\ndeveloped for a variety of time-series models. Here, we are combining those two\napproaches by proposing quantile-based spectral methods for locally stationary\nprocesses. We therefore introduce a time-varying version of the copula spectra\nthat have been recently proposed in the literature, along with a suitable local\nlag-window estimator. We propose a new definition of local {\\it strict}\nstationarity that allows us to handle completely general non-linear processes\nwithout any moment assumptions, thus accommodating our quantile-based concepts\nand methods. We establish a central limit theorem for the new estimators, and\nillustrate the power of the proposed methodology by means of a simulation\nstudy. Moreover, in two empirical studies (namely of the Standard \\& Poor's 500\nseries and a temperature dataset recorded in Hohenpeissenberg) we demonstrate\nthat the new approach detects important variations in serial dependence\nstructures both across time and across quantiles. Such variations remain\ncompletely undetected, and are actually undetectable, via classical\ncovariance-based spectral methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 18:44:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2015 11:29:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 08:58:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-19"}

Having such a representation is the first prerequisite for a variety\nof machine learning algorithms like classification, clustering, etc., over\ngraph datasets. In this paper, we propose a symmetric positive semidefinite\nmatrix with the $(i,j)$-{th} entry equal to the covariance between normalized\nvectors $A^ie$ and $A^je$ ($e$ being vector of all ones) as a representation\nfor graph with adjacency matrix $A$. We show that the proposed matrix\nrepresentation encodes the spectrum of the underlying adjacency matrix and it\nalso contains information about the counts of small sub-structures present in\nthe graph such as triangles and small paths. In addition, we show that this\nmatrix is a \\emph{\"graph invariant\"}. All these properties make the proposed\nmatrix a suitable object for representing graphs.\n  The representation, being a covariance matrix in a fixed dimensional metric\nspace, gives a mathematical embedding for graphs. This naturally leads to a\nmeasure of similarity on graph objects. We define similarity between two given\ngraphs as a Bhattacharya similarity measure between their corresponding\ncovariance matrix representations. As shown in our experimental study on the\ntask of social network classification, such a similarity measure outperforms\nother widely used state-of-the-art methodologies. Our proposed method is also\ncomputationally efficient. The computation of both the matrix representation\nand the similarity value can be performed in operations linear in the number of\nedges.

To personalize user experience, this enormous data has to be\nprocessed in real time, in interactive fashion. In order to achieve faster data\nprocessing often a statistical method called subsampling. Subsampling workloads\ncompute statistics from a random subset of sample data (i.e., a subsample).\nData-parallel platforms group these samples into tasks; each task subsamples\nits data in parallel.\n  Current, state-of-the-art platforms such as Hadoop are built for large tasks\nthat run for long periods of time, but applications with smaller average task\nsizes suffer large overheads on these platforms. Tasks in subsampling workloads\nare sized to minimize the number of overall cache misses, and these tasks can\ncomplete in seconds. This technique can reduce the overall length of a\nmap-reduce job, but only when the savings from the cache miss rate reduction\nare not eclipsed by the platform overhead of task creation and data\ndistribution.\n  In this thesis, we propose a data-parallel platform with an efficient data\ndistribution component that breaks data-parallel subsampling workloads into\ncompute clusters with tiny tasks. Each tiny task completes in few hundreds of\nmilliseconds to seconds. Tiny tasks reduce processor cache misses caused by\nrandom subsampling, which speeds up per-task running time. However, they cause\nsignificant scheduling overheads and data distribution challenges. We propose a\ntask knee-pointing algorithm and a dynamic scheduler that schedules the tasks\nto worker nodes based on the availability and response times of the data nodes.\nWe compare our framework against various configurations of BashReduce and\nHadoop.

Exploiting the\nrestriction of trajectories to 2D surfaces in the case of equal rotation rates\nabout the axes, a method is proposed for identifying and constructing 3D\nKolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) tubes around the normally elliptic period-one\ncurves. The invariant manifold structure arising from the normally hyperbolic\nperiod-one curves is also examined. When the motion is restricted to 2D\nsurfaces, the structure of manifolds of the hyperbolic points in the bulk\ndiffers from that corresponding to hyperbolic points in the flowing layer. Each\nis reminiscent of a template provided by a non-integrable perturbation to a\nHamiltonian system, though the governing LTM is not. This highlights the novel\n3D chaotic behaviors observed in this model dynamical system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 21:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

Moreover,\nthe common Plurality rule is particularly prone to strategic behavior of the\nvoters and empirical studies show that people often vote strategically in\npractice. Multiple game-theoretic models have been proposed to better\nunderstand and predict such behavior and the outcomes it induces. However,\nthese models often make unrealistic assumptions regarding voters' behavior and\nthe information on which they base their vote.\n  We suggest a new model for strategic voting that takes into account voters'\nbounded rationality, as well as their limited access to reliable information.\nWe introduce a simple behavioral heuristic based on \\emph{local dominance},\nwhere each voter considers a set of possible world states without assigning\nprobabilities to them. This set is constructed based on prospective candidates'\nscores (e.g., available from an inaccurate poll). In a \\emph{voting\nequilibrium}, all voters vote for candidates not dominated within the set of\npossible states.\n  We prove that these voting equilibria exist in the Plurality rule for a broad\nclass of local dominance relations (that is, different ways to decide which\nstates are possible). Furthermore, we show that in an iterative setting where\nvoters may repeatedly change their vote, local dominance-based dynamics quickly\nconverge to an equilibrium if voters start from the truthful state. Weaker\nconvergence guarantees in more general settings are also provided.\n  Using extensive simulations of strategic voting on generated and real\npreference profiles, we show that convergence is fast and robust, that emerging\nequilibria are consistent across various starting conditions, and that they\nreplicate widely known patterns of human voting behavior such as Duverger's\nlaw. Further, strategic voting generally improves the quality of the winner\ncompared to truthful voting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2014 04:40:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2014 16:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-22"}

They are of different types viz. Time complexity, Space\ncomplexity, etc. However, none of them consider the execution path as a\ncomplexity measure. Ashok et al, firstly proposed the notion of the Path\nComplexity of a pro-gram/algorithm, which defined based on the number of\nexecution paths as a function of the input size. However, the notion of path\ncomplexity of the pro-gram, cannot apply to the object-oriented environment.\nTherefore, Anupam et al, has extended the notion of path complexity to the\nclass as follows. The notion of the state of the class is defined based on\nstructural representation (aka state) of the class. The class contains data\nmembers and data operations. It considers only those data operations that\nchange the state of the class. The path complexity of the class is defined to\nbe the number of valid input sequences, each of them con-taining valid data\noperations. Anupam et al, had applied this notion to the class Stack. However,\nthe stack is basic and simple data structures. Therefore, in this research we\nhave used a more complex class to understand the path complexity behavior in\nthe object oriented environment. Binary Search Tree (BST) is one of the well\nknown (and more complex too) data structure, which is useful in sorting,\nsearching, Traffic Engineering and many more applications. We have analyzed the\npath complexity of the class BST based on the algorithms for insert and delete\noperations. Additionally, we have modified the delete operation to minimize the\npath complexity for the class BST.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2014 05:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-21"}

Given a subset $\\mathcal{I}\\subseteq U$ it\nshould be possible to quickly compute $\\mathcal{I}\\cap S$, i.e., the elements\nin $\\mathcal{I}$ satisfying the sampling condition. Consistent sampling has\nimportant applications in similarity estimation, and estimation of the number\nof distinct items in a data stream.\n  In this paper we generalize consistent sampling to the setting where we are\ninterested in sampling size-$k$ subsets occurring in some set in a collection\nof sets of bounded size $b$, where $k$ is a small integer. This can be done by\napplying standard consistent sampling to the $k$-subsets of each set, but that\napproach requires time $\\Theta(b^k)$.

Controlling the limit N tends to the\ninfinity of the explicit solution of the N-player game, we highlight the\nstochastic nature of the limit distributions of the states of the players due\nto the fact that the random environment does not average out in the limit, and\nwe recast the Mean Field Game (MFG) paradigm in a set of coupled Stochastic\nPartial Differential Equations (SPDEs). The first one is a forward stochastic\nKolmogorov equation giving the evolution of the conditional distributions of\nthe states of the players given the common noise. The second is a form of\nstochastic Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation providing the solution of the\noptimization problem when the flow of conditional distributions is given.

The role\nof the free energy and diffusion coefficient in this overdamped Langevin\nequation is discussed, along with the way they transform under any change of\nvariable in collective variable space. These results apply both for systems\nwith and without inertia, and they can be generalized to using several\ncollective variables simultaneously. The view they offer on what makes\ncollective variables and reaction coordinates optimal breaks from the standard\nnotion that good collective variable must be slow variable, and it suggests new\nways to interpret data from molecular dynamic simulations and experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2014 09:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In\ncurrent services, users however have to give up their location privacy in order\nto acquire the service. The literature features a large number of contributions\nwhich aim at enhancing user privacy in location-based services. Most of these\ncontributions obfuscate the locations of users using spatial and/or temporal\ncloaking in order to provide k-anonymity. Although such schemes can indeed\nstrengthen the location privacy of users, they often decrease the service\nquality and do not necessarily prevent the possible tracking of user movements\n(i.e., direction, trajectory, velocity). With the rise of Geofencing\napplications, tracking of movements becomes more evident since, in these\nsettings, the service provider is not only requesting a single location of the\nuser, but requires the movement vectors of users to determine whether the user\nhas entered/exited a Geofence of interest.

Specifically, we consider the\ninverse problem with observed variables $Y=B_G x \\oplus Z$, where $B_G$ is the\nincidence matrix of a graph $G$, $x$ is the vector of unknown vertex variables\n(with a uniform prior) and $Z$ is a noise vector with Bernoulli$(\\varepsilon)$\ni.i.d. entries. All variables and operations are Boolean. This model is\nmotivated by coding, synchronization, and community detection problems. In\nparticular, it corresponds to a stochastic block model or a correlation\nclustering problem with two communities and censored edges. Without noise,\nexact recovery (up to global flip) of $x$ is possible if and only the graph $G$\nis connected, with a sharp threshold at the edge probability $\\log(n)/n$ for\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs.

We also develop new techniques for lower bound\ncharacterization of non-homogeneous CDAGs. We demonstrate the use of the\nmethodology by analyzing the CDAGs of several numerical algorithms, to develop\nlower bounds on data movement for their parallel execution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2014 12:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-21"}

We prove a similar result for non-compact Lie groups of arbitrary rank,\narising from Chevalley groups over R or over a p-adic field. We also study this\nproblem for Chevalley groups over arbitrary infinite fields, and show in\nparticular that every element in such a group is a product of two squares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2014 13:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-21"}

This paper addresses this problem\nby parallelizing and adapting the label propagation technique originally\ndeveloped for graph clustering. By introducing size constraints, label\npropagation becomes applicable for both the coarsening and the refinement phase\nof multilevel graph partitioning.

A remarkable\nexample of the superiority of in situ probe measurements is illustrated by the\nexploration of Jupiter, where key measurements such as the determination of the\nnoble gases abundances and the precise measurement of the helium mixing ratio\nhave only been made available through in situ measurements by the Galileo\nprobe. This paper describes the main scientific goals to be addressed by the\nfuture in situ exploration of Saturn placing the Galileo probe exploration of\nJupiter in a broader context and before the future probe exploration of the\nmore remote ice giants. In situ exploration of Saturn's atmosphere addresses\ntwo broad themes that are discussed throughout this paper: first, the formation\nhistory of our solar system and second, the processes at play in planetary\natmospheres. In this context, we detail the reasons why measurements of\nSaturn's bulk elemental and isotopic composition would place important\nconstraints on the volatile reservoirs in the protosolar nebula. We also show\nthat the in situ measurement of CO (or any other disequilibrium species that is\ndepleted by reaction with water) in Saturn's upper troposphere would constrain\nits bulk O/H ratio. We highlight the key measurements required to distinguish\ncompeting theories to shed light on giant planet formation as a common process\nin planetary systems with potential applications to most extrasolar systems. In\nsitu measurements of Saturn's stratospheric and tropospheric dynamics,\nchemistry and cloud-forming processes will provide access to phenomena\nunreachable to remote sensing studies. Different mission architectures are\nenvisaged, which would benefit from strong international collaborations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2014 15:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The\nmacroscopic energy-momentum tensor of the field is shown to be equal to the\nstandard empty-space energy-momentum tensor built with the macroscopic fields\nplus a dipolar correction. The density of momentum of the field is confirmed to\nbe given by Minkowski's expression. The energy-momentum tensor of macroscopic\nmatter is equal to the average of the microscopic energy-momentum tensor of\nmatter plus the difference between the average tensor of microscopic fields and\nthe macroscopic tensor of fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 2014 01:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 03:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-18"}

We compare two natural approaches to define locally quadratically\nconvergent iterations: the first one involves Newton iteration applied to the\napproximate roots individually and then interpolation to find the RUR of these\napproximate roots; the second one considers the coefficients in the exact RUR\nas zeroes of a high dimensional map defined by polynomial reduction, and\napplies Newton iteration on this map. We prove that over fields with a p-adic\nvaluation these two approaches give the same iteration function, but over\nfields equipped with the usual Archimedean absolute value, they are not\nequivalent. In the latter case, we give explicitly the iteration function for\nboth approaches. Finally, we analyze the parallel complexity of the different\nversions of the global Newton iteration, compare them, and demonstrate that\nthey can be efficiently computed. The motivation for this study comes from the\ncertification of approximate roots of overdetermined and singular polynomial\nsystems via the recovery of an exact RUR from approximate numerical data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 20:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

When the extreme value of the density profile reaches\n$\\rho=0.5$, a bulk induced phase transition occurs which exhibits a shock and a\ncontinuously and smoothly decreasing density profile which crosses $\\rho=0.5$\nupstream or downstream of the shock. The existence of double shocks has also\nbeen observed. A mean-field approach has been used to interpret the numerical\nresults obtained by Monte Carlo simulations.
