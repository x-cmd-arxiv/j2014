This hypothesis and its consequences can be studied by\ncomputational models and using a theory of metabolic value. In optimal\nmetabolic states, any increase of an enzyme level must improve the metabolic\nperformance to justify its own cost, so each active enzyme must contribute to\nthe cell's benefit by producing valuable products. This principle of value\nproduction leads to variation rules that relate metabolic fluxes and reaction\nelasticities to enzyme costs. Metabolic value theory provides a language to\ndescribe this. It postulates a balance of local values, which I derive here\nfrom concepts of metabolic control theory. Economic state variables, called\neconomic potentials and loads, describe how metabolites, reactions, and enzymes\ncontribute to metabolic performance. Economic potentials describe the indirect\nvalue of metabolite production, while economic loads describe the indirect\nvalue of metabolite concentrations. These economic variables, and others, are\nlinked by local balance equations. These laws for optimal metabolic states\ndefine conditions for metabolic fluxes that hold for a wide range of rate laws.\nTo produce metabolic value, fluxes run from lower to higher economic\npotentials, must be free of futile cycles, and satisfy a principle of minimal\nweighted fluxes. Given an economical flux mode, one can systematically\nconstruct kinetic models in which all enzymes have positive effects on\nmetabolic performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2014 17:45:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 08:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

This part of the disk is\nshaped by various forces that influence dust and gas dynamics, and by dust\nsublimation, which creates abrupt drops in the dust density. This region also\nemits strong near-infrared excess that cannot be explained by classical\naccretion disk models, which suggests the existence of some unusual dust\ndistribution or disk shape. The most prevalent explanation to date is the\npuffed-up inner disk rim model, where the disk exhibits an optically thin\ncavity around the star up to the distance of dust sublimation. The critical\nparameter in this model is the inner disk rim height $z_{\\rm max}$ relative to\nthe rim distance from the star $R_{\\rm in}$. Observations often require $z_{\\rm\nmax}/R_{\\rm in}\\gtrsim0.2$ to reproduce the near-infrared excess in the\nspectra.

We\noptimize our ansatz w.r.t. $c$ for the frustrated $t-J_1-J_2$ model (including\nboth nearest and next-nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions $J_1$ and\n$J_2$, respectively) for $J_2\\simeq J_1/2$ and obtain an energy very close to\nthe infinite-PEPS state (using full update optimization and same bond\ndimension). The orbital symmetry of the optimized RVB superconductor has\npredominant d-wave character, although we argue a residual (complex s-wave)\ntime reversal symmetry breaking component should always be present. Connections\nof the results to the physics of superconducting cuprates and pnictides are\noutlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2014 18:49:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 May 2014 08:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

Given this fact one\nmight hope to find a local path integral measure that makes the quantum theory\ninvariant under these moves and hence makes the theory partially triangulation\ninvariant. We show that such a local invariant path integral measure does not\nexist for the 4D linearized Regge theory.\n  To this end we uncover an interesting geometric interpretation for the\nHessian of the 4D Regge action. This geometric interpretation will allow us to\nprove that the determinant of the Hessian of the 4D Regge action does not\nfactorize over 4--simplices or subsimplices. It furthermore allows to determine\nconfigurations where this Hessian vanishes, which only appears to be the case\nin degenerate backgrounds or if one allows for different orientations of the\nsimplices.\n  We suggest a non--local measure factor that absorbs the non--local part of\nthe determinant of the Hessian under 5--1 moves as well as a local measure\nfactor that is preserved for very special configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2014 19:48:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 14:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-01"}

Assuming H2O (inner HZ) and CO2 (outer HZ) dominated atmospheres, and\nscaling the background N2 atmospheric pressure with the radius of the planet,\nour results indicate that larger planets have wider HZs than do smaller ones.\nSpecifically, with the assumption that smaller planets will have less dense\natmospheres, the inner edge of the HZ (runaway greenhouse limit) moves outward\n(~10% lower than Earth flux) for low mass planets due to larger greenhouse\neffect arising from the increased H2O column depth. For larger planets, the H2O\ncolumn depth is smaller, and higher temperatures are needed before water vapor\ncompletely dominates the outgoing longwave radiation. Hence the inner edge\nmoves inward (7% higher than Earth's flux). The outer HZ changes little due to\nthe competing effects of the greenhouse effect and an increase in albedo. New,\n3-D climate model results from other groups are also summarized, and we argue\nthat further, independent studies are needed to verify their predictions.\nCombined with our previous work, the results presented here provide refined\nestimates of HZs around main-sequence stars and provide a step towards a more\ncomprehensive analysis of HZs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2014 19:57:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 13:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We\ndo not find obvious signatures of interaction or infalling gas at large spatial\nscales. The neutral gas disk shows obvious rotation, although the velocity\ndispersion is comparable to the rotation velocity. The rotation amplitude is\nestimated to be V_c = 15 +/- 5 km/s. Within the HI radius probed by these\nobservations, the mass ratio of gas to stars is roughly 2:1, while the ratio of\nthe total mass to the baryonic mass is ~15:1.

We detect the\nsignature of two temperature components in the neutral ISM of Leo P; the cold\nand warm components have characteristic velocity widths of 4.2 +/- 0.9 km/s and\n10.1 +/- 1.2 km/s, corresponding to kinetic temperatures of ~1100 K and ~6200\nK, respectively.

This evolutionary constraint provides a simple\nway to probe z>8 galaxy populations without direct observations. Tests of the\nmethod with galaxy properties at z=4 successfully reproduce the known evolution\nof the stellar mass--halo mass (SMHM) relation, galaxy SSFRs, and the cosmic\nstar formation rate (CSFR) for 5<z<8. We then predict the continued evolution\nof these properties for 8<z<15. In contrast to the non-evolution in the SMHM\nrelation at z<4, the median galaxy mass at fixed halo mass increases strongly\nat z>4. We show that this result is closely linked to the flattening in galaxy\nSSFRs at z>2 compared to halo specific mass accretion rates; we expect that\naverage galaxy SSFRs at fixed stellar mass will continue their mild evolution\nto z~15. The expected CSFR shows no breaks or features at z>8.5; this\nconstrains both reionization and the possibility of a steep falloff in the CSFR\nat z=9-10.

In contrast, the distribution of cool gas\naround passive galaxies is consistent with being isotropic on the same scales.\nWe quantify the average excess MgII equivalent width $<\\delta W_{0}^{\\rm\nMgII}>$ as a function of galaxy properties and find $<\\delta W_0^{\\rm\nMgII}>\\propto SFR^{1.2}, sSFR^{0.5}$ and $M_\\ast^{0.4}$ for star-forming\ngalaxies. This work demonstrates that the dichotomy between star-forming and\npassive galaxies is reflected in the CGM traced by low-ionized gas. We also\nmeasure the covering fraction of MgII absorption and find it to be about 2-10\ntimes higher for star-forming galaxies than passive ones within 50 kpc. We\nestimate the amount of neutral gas in the halo of $<\\log M_\\ast/{\\rm\nM_\\odot}>$~10.8 galaxies to be a few x$10^9 \\rm M_\\odot$ for both types of\ngalaxies. Finally, we find that correlations between absorbers and sources\ndetected in the UV and IR lead to physical trends consistent with those\nmeasured in the optical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2014 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 01:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

Using high-resolution 3D plasma simulations, we study the statistics\nof the velocity field and its relation with the thermodynamic perturbations.\nThe normalization of the ICM spectrum (density, entropy, or pressure) is\nlinearly tied to the level of large-scale motions, which excite both gravity\nand sound waves due to stratification. For low 3D Mach number M~0.25, gravity\nwaves mainly drive entropy perturbations, traced by preferentially tangential\nturbulence. For M>0.5, sound waves start to significantly contribute, passing\nthe leading role to compressive pressure fluctuations, associated with\nisotropic (or slightly radial) turbulence. Density and temperature fluctuations\nare then characterized by the dominant process: isobaric (low M), adiabatic\n(high M), or isothermal (strong conduction). Most clusters reside in the\nintermediate regime, showing a mixture of gravity and sound waves, hence\ndrifting towards isotropic velocities. Remarkably, regardless of the regime,\nthe variance of density perturbations is comparable to the 1D Mach number. This\nlinear relation allows to easily convert between gas motions and ICM\nperturbations, which can be exploited by Chandra, XMM data and by the\nforthcoming Astro-H. At intermediate and small scales (10-100 kpc), the\nturbulent velocities develop a Kolmogorov cascade. The thermodynamic\nperturbations act as effective tracers of the velocity field, broadly\nconsistent with the Kolmogorov-Obukhov-Corrsin advection theory. Thermal\nconduction acts to damp the gas fluctuations, washing out the filamentary\nstructures and steepening the spectrum, while leaving unaltered the velocity\ncascade. The ratio of the velocity and density spectrum thus inverts the\ndowntrend shown by the non-diffusive models, allowing to probe the presence of\nsignificant conductivity in the ICM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2014 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 21:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We\nexamine the account of the effect in the old quantum theory, which was hailed\nas a major success of that theory, from the point of view of wave mechanics.\nFirst, we show how the new quantum mechanics solves a fundamental problem one\nruns into in the old quantum theory with the Stark effect. It turns out that,\neven without an external field, it depends on the coordinates in which the\nquantum conditions are imposed which electron orbits are allowed in a hydrogen\natom. The allowed energy levels and hence the line splittings are independent\nof the coordinates used but the size and eccentricity of the orbits are not.

The calculation of intensities of lines on the basis of Bohr's\ncorrespondence principle likewise required arbitrary additional assumptions.\nFinally, the actual orbits predicted by the old quantum theory depend on the\ncoordinates chosen to impose the quantum conditions.

Here we measure the ability to detect statistically significant\nrelationships from scatterplots in a randomized trial of 2,039 students in a\nstatistics massive open online course (MOOC).

Current searches for transiting\ncircumbinary planets concentrate on eclipsing binaries, and are therefore\nrestricted to a small fraction of potential hosts. We investigate the concept\nof finding planets transiting non-eclipsing binaries, whose geometry would\nrequire mutually inclined planes. Using an N-body code we explore how the\nnumber and sequence of transits vary as functions of observing time and orbital\nparameters. The concept is then generalised thanks to a suite of simulated\ncircumbinary systems. Binaries are constructed from RV surveys of the solar\nneighbourhood. They are then populated with orbiting gas giants, drawn from a\nrange of distributions. The binary population is shown to be compatible with\nthe Kepler eclipsing binary catalogue, indicating that the properties of\nbinaries may be as universal as the initial mass function. These synthetic\nsystems produce transiting circumbinary planets occurring on both eclipsing and\nnon-eclipsing binaries. Simulated planets transiting eclipsing binaries are\ncompared with published Kepler detections. We obtain 1) that planets transiting\nnon-eclipsing binaries probably exist in the Kepler data, 2) that observational\nbiases alone cannot account for the observed over-density of circumbinary\nplanets near the stability limit, implying a physical pile-up, and 3) that the\ndistributions of gas giants orbiting single and binary stars are likely\ndifferent. Estimating the frequency of circumbinary planets is degenerate with\nthe spread in mutual inclination. Only a minimum occurrence rate can be\nproduced, which we find to be compatible with 9%. Searching for inclined\ncircumbinary planets may significantly increase the population of known objects\nand will test our conclusions. Their existence, or absence, will reveal the\ntrue occurrence rate and help develop circumbinary planet formation theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 00:58:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 16:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-29"}

Most of these exoplanets have\nbeen detected by either the transit method or the radial velocity method,\nrather than by other methods such as astrometry or direct imaging. Both the\nradial velocity and astrometric methods rely upon the reflex motion of the\nparent star induced by the gravitational attraction of its planets. However,\nthis reflex motion is subject to misinterpretation when a star has two or more\nplanets with the same orbital period. Such co-orbital planets may effectively\n\"hide\" from detection by current algorithms.\n  In principle, any number of planets can share the same orbit; the case where\nthey all have the same mass has been studied most. Salo and Yoder (A & A 205,\n309--327, 1988) have shown that more than 8 planets of equal mass sharing a\ncircular orbit must be equally spaced for dynamical stability, while fewer than\n7 equal-mass planets are stable only in a configuration where all of the\nplanets remain on the same side of their parent star. For 7 or 8 equal-mass\nplanets, both configurations are stable.\n  By symmetry, it is clear that the equally-spaced systems produce no reflex\nmotion or radial velocity signal at all in their parent stars. This could lead\nto their being overlooked entirely, unless they happen to be detected by the\ntransit method. It is equally clear that the lopsided systems produce a greater\nradial velocity signal than a single such planet would, but a smaller signal\nthan if all of the planets were combined into one. This could seriously mislead\nestimates of exoplanet masses and densities. Transit data and ellipsoidal\n(tidal) brightness variations in such systems also are subject to\nmisinterpretation. This behavior is also representative of more natural\nsystems, with co-orbital planets of different masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 04:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

For this class of problems, one may apply the directly extended ADMM to\ntheir dual, which can be written in the form of convex programming with four\nseparable blocks in the objective function and a coupling linear equation\nconstraint. Indeed, the directly extended ADMM, though may diverge in theory,\noften performs much better numerically than many of its variants with\ntheoretical convergence guarantee. Ideally, one should find a convergent\nvariant which is at least as efficient as the directly extended ADMM in\npractice. We achieve this goal by designing a convergent semi-proximal ADMM\n(called sPADMM3c for convenience) for convex programming problems having three\nseparable blocks in the objective function with the third part being linear. At\neach iteration, the proposed sPADMM3c takes one special block coordinate\ndescent (BCD) cycle with the order $1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow\n3$, instead of the usual $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3$ Gauss-Seidel BCD cycle\nused in the non-convergent directly extended $3$-block ADMM, for updating the\nvariable blocks. Our extensive numerical tests on the important class of doubly\nnon-negative semidefinite programming (SDP) problems with linear equality\nand/or inequality constraints demonstrate that our convergent method is at\nleast $20%$ faster than the directly extended ADMM with unit step-length for\nthe vast majority of about $550$ large scale problems tested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 04:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 05:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

The g-matrix\ncalculated in nuclear matter from the chiral N3LO two-nucleon forces (2NF) is\nclose to that from the Bonn-B 2NF. Because the Melbourne group have already\ndeveloped a practical g-matrix interaction by localizing the nonlocal g-matrix\ncalculated from the Bonn-B 2NF, we consider the effects of chiral 3NF, in this\nfirst attempt to study the 3NF effects, by modifying the local Melbourne\ng-matrix according to the difference between the g-matrices of the chiral 2NF\nand 2NF+3NF. For nucleus-nucleus elastic scattering, the 3NF corrections make\nthe folding potential less attractive and more absorptive. The latter novel\neffect is due to the enhanced tensor correlations in triplet channels. These\nchanges reduce the differential cross section at the middle and large angles,\nimproving the agreement with the experimental data for 16O-16O scattering at 70\nMeV/nucleon and 12C-12C scattering at 85 MeV/nucleon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 06:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The\ncost to run a task not only depends on the intrinsic cost of the task itself,\nbut also monotonically related to the position this task is in the working list\nof the agent assigned. Such a positional effect can naturally arise from the\nclassic sum-of-completion-time minimization problems, and is also well\nmotivated by the varying efficiency when an agent works in reality (such as due\nto the learning effects or deteriorating effects). Also, it can be seen as a\ndeterministic variant of the classic Baysian sequential decision making\nproblems. This paper presents a simple and practical algorithm that runs in\n$O(k^2 n)$ time and minimizes the total cost of any problem instance consisting\nof two task types.

One of the most\ncelebrated equations that allows unphysical solutions is the relativistic\nMajorana equation\\cite{Majorana} which might describe neutrinos and other\nexotic particles beyond the Standard Model. The equation's physical solutions,\nthe Majorana fermions, are predicted to be their own anti-particles and as a\nconsequence they have to be neutrally charged; the charged version however\n(called Majoranon) is, due to charge non-conservation, unphysical and cannot\nexist. On the other hand, charge conservation violation has been contemplated\nin alternative theories associated with higher spacetime dimensions or a\nnon-vanishing photon mass; theories whose exotic nature makes experimental\ntesting with current technology an impossible task. In our work, we present an\nexperimental scheme based on optics with which we simulate the dynamics of a\nMajoranon, involving the implementation of unphysical charge conjugation and\ncomplex conjugation. We show that the internal dynamics of the Majoranon is\nfundamentally different from that of its close cousin, the Dirac particle, to\nillustrate the nature of the unphysical operations.

We investigate this problem by adopting a theoretical model\ndeveloped for understanding the statistical properties of exoplanets. Our model\nis constructed as the combination of planet traps with the standard core\naccretion scenario in which the efficiency of forming planetary cores directly\nrelates to the dust density in disks or the metallicity ([Fe/H]). We\nstatistically compute planet formation frequencies (PFFs) as well as the\norbital radius ($<R_{rapid}>$) within which gas accretion becomes efficient\nenough to form Jovian planets. The three characteristic exoplanetary\npopulations are considered: hot Jupiters, exo-Jupiters densely populated around\n1 AU, and low-mass planets such as super-Earths. We explore the behavior of the\nPFFs as well as $<R_{rapid}>$ for the three different populations as a function\nof metallicity ($-2 \\leq$[Fe/H]$\\leq -0.6$). We show that the total PFFs\nincrease steadily with metallicity, which is the direct outcome of the core\naccretion picture. For the entire range of the metallicity considered here, the\npopulation of the low-mass planets dominates over the Jovian planets. The\nJovian planets contribute to the PFFs above [Fe/H]-1. We find that the hot\nJupiters form at lower metallcities than the exo-Jupiters. This arises from the\nradially inward transport of planetary cores by their host traps, which is more\neffective for lower metallicity disks due to the slower growth of the cores.\nThe PFFs for the exo-Jupiters exceed those for the hot Jupiters around\n[Fe/H]-0.7. Finally, we show that the critical metallicity for forming Jovian\nplanets is [Fe/H]-1.2, which is evaluated by comparing the values of\n$<R_{rapid}>$ between the hot Jupiters and the low-mass planets. The comparison\nintrinsically links to the different gas accretion efficiency between them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 11:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Here we present the results of a set of\ndetailed Monte Carlo simulations of the population of WD+MS binaries in the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7. We used up-to-date stellar\nevolutionary models, a complete treatment of the Roche lobe overflow episode,\nand a full implementation of the orbital evolution of the binary systems.\nMoreover, in our treatment we took into account the selection criteria and all\nthe known observational biases. Our population synthesis study allowed us to\nmake a meaningful comparison with the available observational data. In\nparticular, we examined the CE efficiency, the possible contribution of\ninternal energy, and the initial mass ratio distribution (IMRD) of the binary\nsystems. We found that our simulations correctly reproduce the properties of\nthe observed distribution of WD+MS PCEBs. In particular, we found that once the\nobservational biases are carefully taken into account, the distribution of\norbital periods and of masses of the WD and MS stars can be correctly\nreproduced for several choices of the free parameters and different IMRDs,\nalthough models in which a moderate fraction (<=10%) of the internal energy is\nused to eject the CE and in which a low value of CE efficiency is used (<=0.3)\nseem to fit better the observational data. We also found that systems with\nHe-core WDs are over-represented in the observed sample, due to selection\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 12:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

However, often the interest is predicting individual\nvalues or means of the variable in the original scale. Back transformation of\npredicted values introduces a non-negligible bias. Moreover, assessing the\nuncertainty of the actual predictor is not straightforward. In this paper, a\nnested error model for the log transformation of the target variable is\nconsidered. Nested error models are widely used for estimation of means in\nsubpopulations with small sample sizes (small areas), by linking all the areas\nthrough common parameters. These common parameters are estimated using the\noverall set of sample data, which leads to much more efficient small area\nestimators. Analytical expressions for the best predictors of individual values\nof the original variable and of small area means are obtained under the nested\nerror model with log transformation of the target variable. Empirical best\npredictors are defined by estimating the unknown model parameters in the best\npredictors. Exact mean squared errors of the best predictors and second order\napproximations to the mean squared errors of the empirical best predictors are\nderived. Mean squared error estimators that are second order correct are also\nobtained. An example with Mexican data on living conditions illustrates the\nprocedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 12:07:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 06:02:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

At large deformations beyond the second barrier\nthe occurrence of a third one was predicted by Mic-Mac model calculations in\nthe 1970s, but contradictory results were later reported. In this paper,\ntriple-humped barriers in actinide nuclei are investigated with covariant\ndensity functional theory (CDFT). Calculations are performed using the\nmultidimensionally-constrained relativistic mean field (MDC-RMF) model, with\nfunctionals PC-PK1 and DD-ME2. Pairing correlations are treated in the BCS\napproximation with a separable pairing force of finite range. Two-dimensional\nPES's of $^{226,228,230,232}$Th and $^{232,234,236,238}$U are mapped and the\nthird minima on these surfaces are located. Then one-dimensional potential\nenergy curves along the fission path are analyzed in detail and the energies of\nthe second barrier, the third minimum, and the third barrier are determined.\nDD-ME2 predicts the occurrence of a third barrier in all Th nuclei and\n$^{238}$U. The third minima in $^{230,232}$Th are very shallow, whereas those\nin $^{226,228}$Th and $^{238}$U are quite prominent. With PC-PK1 a third\nbarrier is found only in $^{226,228,230}$Th. Single-nucleon levels around the\nFermi surface are analyzed in $^{226}$Th, and it is found that the formation of\nthe third minimum is mainly due to the $Z=90$ proton energy gap at $\\beta_{20}\n\\approx 1.5$ and $\\beta_{30} \\approx 0.7$. The possible occurrence of a third\nbarrier in actinide nuclei depends on the effective interaction used in\nmultidimensional CDFT calculations. More pronounced minima are predicted by the\nDD-ME2 functional, as compared to the functional PC-PK1. The depth of the third\nwell in Th isotopes decreases with increasing neutron number. The origin of the\nthird minimum is due to the proton $Z=90$ shell gap at relevant deformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 12:08:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 23:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-28"}

Here, we put forward a novel method that addresses this issue. It uses\ndynamic control of the phase in the transverse plane of the structured light\nbeam so that the direction of the particles' movement can be deduced. This is\ndone by noting the change in the magnitude of the frequency shift as the\ntransverse phase of the structured light is moved appropriately. We demonstrate\nour method with rotating micro-particles that are illuminated by a\nLaguerre-Gaussian beam with a rotating phase about its propagation axis.

The negative contributions coming from direct corrections, i.e. the\ncorrections associated to effects of new physics in the fermionic sector, can\nbe used to eliminate unwanted positive oblique contributions to $S$. By means\nof such an ideal cancellation among oblique and direct corrections the\nelectroweak physics can be made insensitive to custodial new physics. The\nLagrangian analysis of the ideal cancellation reveals a possible sizable\nredefinition of the effective electroweak energy scale with respect to models\nwith only oblique corrections. We then infer from general principles the full\nexpression for the effective custodial operator responsible in the gauge sector\nfor the contribution to $S$. We show that the ideal cancellation exactly\neliminates all the custodial corrections, including those in the non-abelian\nand longitudinal terms. Indeed, provided redefinitions of the physical\nparameters, the standard model Lagrangian can be equivalently defined modulo\ncustodial corrections in the gauge and fermionic sectors.

The composite's unit cell may consist of any number of layers\nof any variable mass-density and elastic shear modulus (with large\ndiscontinuities).\n  Explicit series expressions for displacement, velocity, strain and stress\ncomponents, and energy-flux fields are given, and group-velocity vector is\ncalculated. The approach is based on a mixed variational principle where the\ndisplacement and stress components are viewed as independent fields subject to\narbitrary variation. These fields are hence approximated independently, thereby\nensuring the necessary continuity conditions. The resulting computational\nmethod yields the composite's frequency band structure and the associated mode\nshapes, in terms of the wave-vector components for any desired number of\nfrequency bands.\n  The general results are illustrated using a two-phase and a three-phase unit\ncell with piecewise constant properties.
