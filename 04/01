We aim to explain the scatter in Sr, Ba, Y, and Eu abundance\nratio diagrams unveiled by the metal-poor halo stars. Methods. We computed\ninhomogeneous chemical evolution models for the Galactic halo assuming\ndifferent scenarios for the r-process site: the electron-capture supernovae\n(EC) and the magnetorotationally driven (MRD) supernovae scenario.

Results. The scatter observed in\nthese abundance ratios of the very metal-poor stars (with [Fe/H] < -2.5) can be\nexplained by combining the s-process production in spinstars, and the r-process\ncontribution coming from massive stars.

Although\nthe method has proved its competence in predicting binding modes correctly, its\ninherent complexity puts high demands on computational resources. Moreover the\nchemical space to be screened is prohibitively large. Therefore the application\nof filtering prior to docking is a promising concept. We implemented a\npre-docking filter based on the tangent distance algorithm originally conceived\nfor optical character recognition. The challenging transfer of the method from\ntwo-dimensional to three-dimensional data was achieved by representing the\nmolecular structure by a set of density maps extracted from different views of\nthe compound. Additionally, our program applies a binary classification using\nprincipal component analysis. Ligand and binding pocket are aligned according\nto their centroidal axes, enabling a size-based filtering for the purpose of\nenriching the dataset regarding ligands before docking.

A generating function for q-dimensions\nof these spaces is what we suggest to call the primary T-deformation of HOMFLY\npolynomial -- because, as we demonstrate, it can be explicitly reduced to\ncalculations of ordinary HOMFLY polynomials, i.e. to manipulations with quantum\nR-matrices. The second step is a certain minimization of residues of this new\npolynomial with respect to T+1. Minimization is ambiguous and is actually\nspecified by the choice of commuting cut-and-join morphisms, acting along the\nedges of the hypercube -- this promotes it to Abelian quiver, and KR polynomial\nis a Poincare polynomial of associated complex, just in the original Khovanov's\nconstruction at N=2.

It is shown here,\nhowever, that while the standard analysis of tetraquarks does not rule them\nout, a more thorough analysis rules out quantum-number exotic tetraquarks\nassociated with the leading-order connected diagrams.

Although the\ninformation theoretic characterizations for these two CI quantities can be\neasily evaluated for random variables with infinite entropy (eg., continuous\nrandom variables), their operational significance is applicable only to the\nlossless framework. The primary objective of this paper is to generalize these\ntwo CI notions to the lossy Gray-Wyner network, which hence extends the\ntheoretical foundation to general sources and distortion measures. We begin by\nderiving a single letter characterization for the lossy generalization of\nWyner's CI, defined as the minimum rate on the shared branch of the Gray-Wyner\nnetwork, maintaining minimum sum transmit rate when the two decoders\nreconstruct the sources subject to individual distortion constraints. To\ndemonstrate its use, we compute the CI of bivariate Gaussian random variables\nfor the entire regime of distortions. We then similarly generalize Gacs and\nKorner's definition to the lossy framework. The latter half of the paper\nfocuses on studying the tradeoff between the total transmit rate and receive\nrate in the Gray-Wyner network. We show that this tradeoff yields a contour of\npoints on the surface of the Gray-Wyner region, which passes through both the\nWyner and Gacs-Korner operating points, and thereby provides a unified\nframework to understand the different notions of CI. We further show that this\ntradeoff generalizes the two notions of CI to the excess sum transmit rate and\nreceive rate regimes, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 17:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-01"}

We detected one to six individual absorption components\nalong any given sight line, and the number of absorbers roughly correlates with\nthe pathlength. This high-resolution near-ultraviolet (NUV) spectroscopic\nsurvey was specifically designed for sight lines with existing far-UV (FUV)\nobservations.

The new observations of LISM velocity\nstructure are also critical in the interpretation of astrospheric absorption\nderived from fitting the saturated HI Lyman-alpha profile.

Besides the disc frequency, its mass,\nangular momentum, and energy, in particular the disc's size is prone to being\nchanged by a passing star. So far the change in disc size was only investigated\nfor a small number of very specific encounters. Several studies investigated\nthe effect of the cluster environment on the sizes of planetary systems, like\nour own solar system, based on a generalisation of information from this\nlimited sample. We performed numerical simulations covering the wide parameter\nspace typical for young star clusters, to test the validity of this approach.\nHere the sizes of discs after encounters are presented, based on a size\ndefinition which is comparable to that one used in observational studies.

The cross-correlation between the spectra showed a spatial\ndistribution in velocity suggestive of scattering by a disk surrounding the\nstar. This would be one of the few spatial inferences of a disk observed in a\nFU Orionis object. However, in order to fully understand the observed\nstructure, higher angular and spectral resolution observations are required.\nV1515 Cyg appears now as an important object to be observed with a new\ngeneration of instruments to increase our knowledge about the disk and outflows\nstructure in FU Orionis objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 18:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

When a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle WIMP\nfrom the Galactic Halo elastically scatters off of a nucleus in the detector,\nthe small amount of energy deposited can trigger an explosion. For specificity,\nthis paper focuses on a type of two-component explosive known as a\nnanothermite, consisting of a metal and an oxide in close proximity. When the\ntwo components interact they undergo a rapid exothermic reaction --- an\nexplosion. As a specific example, we consider metal nanoparticles of 5 nm\nradius embedded in an oxide. One cell contains more than a few million\nnanoparticles, and a large number of cells adds up to a total of 1 kg detector\nmass. A WIMP interacts with a metal nucleus of the nanoparticles, depositing\nenough energy to initiate a reaction at the interface between the two layers.\nWhen one nanoparticle explodes it initiates a chain reaction throughout the\ncell. A number of possible thermite materials are studied. Excellent background\nrejection can be achieved because of the nanoscale granularity of the detector:\nwhereas a WIMP will cause a single cell to explode, backgrounds will instead\nset off multiple cells.\n  If the detector operates at room temperature, we find that WIMPs with masses\nabove 100 GeV (or for some materials above 1 TeV) could be detected; they\ndeposit enough energy ($>$10 keV) to cause an explosion. When operating\ncryogenically at liquid nitrogen or liquid helium temperatures, the nano\nexplosive WIMP detector can detect energy deposits as low as 0.5 keV, making\nthe nano explosive detector more sensitive to very light $<$10 GeV WIMPs,\nbetter than other dark matter detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 18:21:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 18:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-15"}

Physically relevant quantities are then to be obtained as the\nquotient of the solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations by these gauge\nsymmetries.\n  In this article we show that one can construct a gauge theory for a standard\nsigma model in arbitrary space-time dimensions where the target metric is not\ninvariant with respect to any rigid symmetry group, but satisfies a much weaker\ncondition: It is sufficient to find a collection of vector fields v_a on the\ntarget M satisfying the extended Killing equation v_{a(i;j)}=0 for some\nconnection acting on the index a. For regular foliations this is equivalent to\nrequiring the conormal bundle to the leaves with its induced metric to be\ninvariant under leaf-preserving diffeomorphisms of M, which in turn generalizes\nRiemannian submersions to which the notion reduces for smooth leaf spaces M/~.\n  The resulting gauge theory has the usual quotient effect with respect to the\noriginal ungauged theory: in this way, much more general orbits can be factored\nout than usually considered. In some cases these are orbits that do not\ncorrespond to an initial symmetry, but still can be generated by a finite\ndimensional Lie group G. Then the presented gauging procedure leads to an\nordinary gauge theory with Lie algebra valued 1-form gauge fields, but showing\nan unconventional transformation law. In general, however, one finds that the\nnotion of an ordinary structural Lie group is too restrictive and should be\nreplaced by the much more general notion of a structural Lie groupoid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 18:29:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 10:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-23"}

Cybernetics defines the general\nregulatory mechanisms that a system can use to prevent or repair the damage\nproduced by disturbances. According to the law of requisite variety,\ndisturbances can be held in check by maximizing buffering capacity, range of\ncompensatory actions, and knowledge about which action to apply to which\ndisturbance. This suggests a general strategy for rejuvenating the organism by\nincreasing its capabilities of adaptation. Buffering can be optimized by\nproviding sufficient rest together with plenty of nutrients: amino acids,\nantioxidants, methyl donors, vitamins, minerals, etc. Knowledge and the range\nof action can be extended by subjecting the organism to an as large as possible\nvariety of challenges. These challenges are ideally brief so as not to deplete\nresources and produce irreversible damage. However, they should be sufficiently\nintense and unpredictable to induce an overshoot in the mobilization of\nresources for damage repair, and to stimulate the organism to build stronger\ncapabilities for tackling future challenges. This allows them to override the\ntrade-offs and limitations that evolution has built into the organism's repair\nprocesses in order to conserve potentially scarce resources. Such acute,\n\"hormetic\" stressors strengthen the organism in part via the \"order from noise\"\nmechanism that destroys dysfunctional structures by subjecting them to strong,\nrandom variations. They include heat and cold, physical exertion, exposure,\nstretching, vibration, fasting, food toxins, micro-organisms, environmental\nenrichment and psychological challenges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 19:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-08"}

The spectrum in both types of objects\nflattens at the locations of the jet components indicating particle\nacceleration or density enhancements along the jet. The mean spectral index at\nthe component locations of -0.81 corresponds to a power-law index of ~2.6 for\nthe electron energy distribution.

Compared to quasars, BL Lacs have more jet components with\nperpendicular magnetic field alignment, which may explain their generally\nflatter spectra. The overall steepening of the spectra with distance can be\nexplained with radiative losses if the jets are collimating or with the\nevolution of the high-energy cutoff in the electron spectrum if the jets are\nconical.

We propose\nthat crystal field anisotropy may dominate over weak dipolar spin interactions\nin SrTm2O4, leading to a virtually nonmagnetic ordering state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 21:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-17"}

Combined with the random diffusion movement\ninherited from BioScape, programmable locations allow us to capture the\nassemblies of configurations of polymers, oligomers, and complexes such as\nmicrotubules or actin filaments.\n  Further new aspects of BioScapeL include random translation and scaling.\nRandom translation is instrumental in describing the location of new entities\nrelative to the old ones. For example, when a cell secretes a hydronium ion,\nthe ion should be placed at a given distance from the originating cell, but in\na random direction. Additionally, scaling allows us to capture at a high level\nevents such as division and growth; for example, daughter cells after mitosis\nhave half the size of the mother cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 00:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-02"}

A serious obstacle here, however, is the challenge of\ncomputing theoretical waveforms for eccentric systems with the requisite\naccuracy for use in a matched-filter search. The corresponding waveforms are\nmore a sequence of concentrated bursts of energy emitted near periapse than a\ncontinuous waveform. Based on this, an alternative approach, stacking excess\npower over the set of time-frequency tiles coincident with the bursts, was\nrecently suggested as a more practical (though sub-optimal) detection strategy.\nThe leading-order \"observable\" that would be inferred from such a detection\nwould be a sequence of discrete numbers characterizing the position and size of\neach time-frequency tile. In General Relativity, this (possibly large) sequence\nof numbers is uniquely determined by the small set of parameters describing the\nbinary at formation.

Like Church, probabilistic models and inference\nproblems in Venture are specified via a Turing-complete, higher-order\nprobabilistic language descended from Lisp. Unlike Church, Venture also\nprovides a compositional language for custom inference strategies built out of\nscalable exact and approximate techniques. We also describe four key aspects of\nVenture's implementation that build on ideas from probabilistic graphical\nmodels. First, we describe the stochastic procedure interface (SPI) that\nspecifies and encapsulates primitive random variables. The SPI supports custom\ncontrol flow, higher-order probabilistic procedures, partially exchangeable\nsequences and ``likelihood-free'' stochastic simulators. It also supports\nexternal models that do inference over latent variables hidden from Venture.\nSecond, we describe probabilistic execution traces (PETs), which represent\nexecution histories of Venture programs. PETs capture conditional dependencies,\nexistential dependencies and exchangeable coupling. Third, we describe\npartitions of execution histories called scaffolds that factor global inference\nproblems into coherent sub-problems. Finally, we describe a family of\nstochastic regeneration algorithms for efficiently modifying PET fragments\ncontained within scaffolds. Stochastic regeneration linear runtime scaling in\ncases where many previous approaches scaled quadratically. We show how to use\nstochastic regeneration and the SPI to implement general-purpose inference\nstrategies such as Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs sampling, and blocked proposals\nbased on particle Markov chain Monte Carlo and mean-field variational inference\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 01:44:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-02"}

We present here the\ndetection of an additional narrow absorption feature at ~70 km/s in the\nobserved spectra of HDO, NH3 and C3. The 70 km/s feature is not uniquely\nidentifiable with the dynamic components (the main cloud and the large-scale\nforeground filament) so-far identified toward this region. The narrow\nabsorption feature is similar to the one found toward low-mass protostars,\nwhich is characteristic of the presence of a cold external envelope. The\nfar-infrared spectroscopic data were combined with existing ground-based\nobservations of 12CO, 13CO, CCH, CN, and C3H2 to characterize the 70 km/s\ncomponent. Using a non-LTE analysis of multiple transitions of NH3 and CN, we\nestimated the density (n(H2) (1-5)x10^5 cm^-3) and temperature (10-30 K) for\nthis narrow feature. We used a gas-grain warm-up based chemical model with\nphysical parameters derived from the NH3 data to explain the observed\nabundances of the different chemical species.

We\nexplore the composition dependent crystallization behaviour by varying the\nrelative block length with weak and strong segregation strength between the\nblocks. In weak segregation limit, we observe that with increasing the\ncomposition of B-block, its crystallization temperature increases accompanying\nwith higher crystallinity. In contrast, A-block crystallizes at a relatively\nlow temperature along with the formation of thicker and larger crystallites\nwith the increase in B-block composition. We attribute this non-intuitive\ncrystallization trend to the dilution effect imposed by B-block. When the\ncomposition of the B-block is high enough, it acts like a 'solvent' during the\ncrystallization of A-block. A-block segments are more mobile and hence less\nfacile to crystallize, resulting depression in crystallization temperature with\nthe formation of thicker crystals. At strong segregation limit, crystallization\nand morphological development are governed by the confinement effect, rather\nthan block asymmetry. Isothermal crystallization reveals that the\ncrystallization follows a homogeneous nucleation mechanism with the formation\nof two dimensional crystals.

For x <= 0.4,\nthe initial Ni3+ state gradually changes to the Ni2+ state with increasing x up\nto 0.4. On further increase of x > 0.4, the Ni2+ state is substituted for the\nMn2+ state, which gradually changes to the final Mn3+ state. We also present an\ninelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements on CeNi0.8Bi2 (i.e. x=0)\nbetween 1.2 and 12 K. The high energy INS study reveals the presence of two\nwell defined crystal electric field (CEF) excitations near 9 meV and 19 meV at\n1.2 K and 6 K, while the low energy INS study reveals the presence of\nquasi-elastic scattering above 4 K. We will discuss our INS results of\nCeNi0.8Bi2 based on the crystal electric field model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 05:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Current theories for spatially varying strain use linear\nor finite strain theory whose derivation is based on small displacements of\ninfinitesimal length vectors.

This\nmethod gives a finite displacement term whose contribution is comparable to\nthat of the linear strain term. Further to this, we show that a 'domain\nwall'-like pseudo-magnetic field profile can be generated when a wide graphene\nribbon is subjected to a pair of opposing point forces (point stretch). The\nresulting field is a function of the new finite displacement term only and\ndisplays a maximum strength of over three times that which is predicted by the\nlinear strain theory.

For a flow on R x S$^2$ this leaves only\none possibility, since on the 2-sphere all Killing fields are conjugate to each\nother, and it is well-known that the gravity dual of such a (conformal) fluid\nis the spherical KNAdS$_4$ black hole. On the other hand, in R x H$^2$ the\nsituation is more complicated, since the isometry group of H$^2$ admits\nelliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic elements. One might thus ask what the\ngravity duals of the flows corresponding to these three different cases are.\nAnswering this question is one of the scopes of this paper. In particular we\nidentify the black hole dual to a fluid that is purely translating on the\nhyperbolic plane. Although this lies within the Carter-Plebanski (CP) class, it\nhas never been studied in the literature before, and represents thus in\nprinciple a new black hole solution in AdS$_4$. For a rigidly rotating fluid in\nR x H$^2$ (holographically dual to the hyperbolic KNAdS$_4$ solution), there is\na certain radius where the velocity reaches the speed of light, and thus the\nfluid can cover only the region within this radius. Quite remarkably, it turns\nout that the boundary of the hyperbolic KNAdS$_4$ black hole is conformal to\nexactly that part of R x H$^2$ in which the fluid velocity does not exceed the\nspeed of light. We extend these results to establish a precise mapping between\npossible flows on ultrastatic spacetimes (with constant curvature spatial\nsections) and the parameter space of the CP solution.

We have used\nWFPC2 on board HST to obtain F791W and F850LP images of 47 members of these\nregions that have spectral types of M6-L0 (0.01-0.1 Msun). An additional\nlate-type member of Taurus, FU Tau (M7.25+M9.25), was also observed with\nadaptive optics at Keck Observatory. We have applied PSF subtraction to the\nprimaries and have searched the resulting images for objects that have colors\nand magnitudes that are indicative of young low-mass objects.

Unlike the sum decoding delay, the maximum\ndecoding delay as a definition of delay for IDNC allows a more equitable\ndistribution of the delays between the different receivers and thus a better\nQuality of Service (QoS). In order to solve this problem, we first derive the\nexpressions for the probability distributions of maximum decoding delay\nincrements. Given these expressions, we formulate the problem as a maximum\nweight clique problem in the IDNC graph. Although this problem is known to be\nNP-hard, we design a greedy algorithm to perform effective packet selection.\nThrough extensive simulations, we compare the sum decoding delay and the max\ndecoding delay experienced when applying the policies to minimize the sum\ndecoding delay [1] and our policy to reduce the max decoding delay. Simulations\nresults show that our policy gives a good agreement among all the delay aspects\nin all situations and outperforms the sum decoding delay policy to effectively\nminimize the sum decoding delay when the channel conditions become harsher.\nThey also show that our definition of delay significantly improve the number of\nserved receivers when they are subject to strict delay constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 14:49:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-02"}

Such a generator should work at room temperature, be highly\nintegrable with existing semiconductor technology, and work with neither\nferromagnetic materials nor externally applied magnetic fields. We have matched\nthese requirements by realizing the spintronic equivalent of a photovoltaic\ncell. While the latter spatially separates photoexcited electron and hole\ncharges, our device exploits circularly polarized light to produce two\nspatially well-defined electron populations with opposite spin. This is\nachieved by modulating the phase and amplitude of the light wavefronts entering\na semiconductor (germanium) with a patterned metal overlayer (platinum). This\nallows creating a light diffraction pattern with spatially-modulated chirality\ninside the semiconductor, which locally excites spin-polarized electrons thanks\nto electric dipole selection rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 15:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-02"}

The early criticisms were primarily on matters of principle, such as\nthe absence of conservation laws and perceived cosmological problems; an\nimportant step in addressing these issues was the development of the\nLagrangian-based non-relativistic theory of Bekenstein and Milgrom. This theory\nled to the development of a tentative relativistic theory that formed the basis\nfor later multi-field theories of gravity. On an empirical level the predictive\nsuccess of the idea with respect to the phenomenology of galaxies presents\nconsiderable challenges for cold dark matter. For MOND the essential challenge\nremains the absence of a generally accepted theoretical underpinning of the\nidea and, thus, cosmological predictions.
