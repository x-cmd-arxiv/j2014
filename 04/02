In particular, the Antennae\ngalaxy (NGC4038/39), a merging system with a relatively high star formation\nrate, has the second flattest luminosity function in the sample. A tentative\ncorrelation may also be present between Hubble Type and values of $\\alpha$, in\nthe sense that later type galaxies (i.e., Sd and Sm) appear to have flatter\nluminosity functions.

An efficient information exchange is likewise important,\nespecially on structured populations, where interactions between players are\nlimited. Motivated by these two facts, we explore the role of facilitators in\nsocial dilemmas on networks. Facilitators are here mirrors to their neighbors\n-- they cooperate with cooperators and defect with defectors -- but they do not\nparticipate in the exchange of strategies. As such, in addition to introducing\ndirect reciprocity, they also obstruct information exchange. In well-mixed\npopulations, facilitators favor the replacement and invasion of defection by\ncooperation as long as their number exceeds a critical value. In structured\npopulations, on the other hand, there exists a delicate balance between the\nbenefits of reciprocity and the deterioration of information exchange.\nExtensive Monte Carlo simulations of social dilemmas on various interaction\nnetworks reveal that there exists an optimal interplay between reciprocity and\ninformation exchange, which sets in only when a small number of facilitators\noccupies the main hubs of the scale-free network. The drawbacks of missing\ncooperative hubs are more than compensated by reciprocity and, at the same\ntime, the compromised information exchange is routed via the auxiliary hubs\nwith only marginal losses in effectivity. These results indicate that it is not\nalways optimal for the main hubs to become ''leaders of the masses'', but\nrather to exploit their highly connected state to promote tit-for-tat-like\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 19:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-07"}

Using observational data\nin the literature, we apply our analytic predictions to two different\nastrophysical environments, namely galactic nuclei and young open star\nclusters.

A stable state of approximate energy equilibrium\ncannot be achieved in our model if gas damping is present, even if Spitzer's\nCriterion is satisfied. This instability drives the continued dynamical\ndecoupling and subsequent ejection (and/or collisions) of the more massive\npopulation.

We\ntest the ability of these parametrised models to recover (at z=0, 0.5, and 1)\nthe stellar mass-to-light ratios, specific star formation rates, and stellar\npopulation ages from the galaxy colours, computed from the full SPH star\nformation histories using the FSPS code of Conroy et al. (2009). Fits with\ntau-models systematically overestimate M/L by ~ 0.2 dex, overestimate\npopulation ages by ~ 1-2 Gyr, and underestimate sSFR by ~ 0.05 dex. Fits with\nlin-exp are less biased on average, but the 4-parameter model yields the best\nresults for the full range of galaxies. Marginalizing over the free parameters\nof the 4-parameter model leads to slightly larger statistical errors than\n1-parameter fits but essentially removes all systematic biases, so this is our\nrecommended procedure for fitting real galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 21:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-03"}

This paper proposes a new approach\nto infer such interaction mechanisms from electroencephalographic (EEG) data\nusing a new estimator of directed information (DI) called logit shrinkage\noptimized directed information assessment (L-SODA). Unlike previous directed\ninformation measures applied to neural decoding, L-SODA uses shrinkage\nregularization on multinomial logistic regression to deal with the high\ndimensionality of multi-channel EEG signals and the small sizes of many\nreal-world datasets. It is designed to make few a priori assumptions and can\nhandle both non-linear and non-Gaussian flows among electrodes. Our L-SODA\nestimator of the DI is accompanied by robust statistical confidence intervals\non the true DI that make it especially suitable for hypothesis testing on the\ninformation flow patterns. We evaluate our work in the context of two different\nproblems where interaction localization is used to determine highly interactive\nareas for EEG signals spatially and temporally. First, by mapping the areas\nthat have high DI into Brodmann area, we identify that the areas with high DI\nare associated with motor-related functions. We demonstrate that L-SODA\nprovides better accuracy for neural decoding of EEG signals as compared to\nseveral state-of-the-art approaches on the Brain Computer Interface (BCI) EEG\nmotor activity dataset. Second, the proposed L-SODA estimator is evaluated on\nthe CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database. We demonstrate that compared to the\nstate-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method provides better performance in\ndetecting the epileptic seizure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 21:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-03"}

A high signal power is achieved by\ntransmitting the same data signal from all antennas, but with different\namplitudes and phases, such that the signal components add coherently at the\nuser. Low interference is accomplished by making the signal components add\ndestructively at non-intended users. This corresponds mathematically to\ndesigning beamforming vectors (that describe the amplitudes and phases) to have\nlarge inner products with the vectors describing the intended channels and\nsmall inner products with non-intended user channels.\n  While it is fairly easy to design a beamforming vector that maximizes the\nsignal power at the intended user, it is difficult to strike a perfect balance\nbetween maximizing the signal power and minimizing the interference leakage.

For $d\\geq 3$, it follows from the\nErd\\H{o}s-Stone theorem in extremal graph theory that $N_d(n)=\\frac12(1-1/k)n^2\n+ o(n^2)$ for a suitable positive integer $k=k(d)$. Here we prove that $k(3)=2$\nand, in general, $\\lceil d/2\\rceil \\leq k(d)\\leq d-1$. Moreover, asymptotically\nwe have $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}k(d)/d=1$. The same bounds hold for the\nmaximum number of strict double-normal pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 23:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

We reconstruct the\nmatrix density of an OAM entangled state postselected in a two-dimensional\nsubspace with a fidelity of 90.3%+/-0.8% and obtain the Clauser, Horne and\nShimony and Holt inequality parameter S of 2.41+/-0.06 after a programmed\nstorage time. All results clearly show the preservation of entanglement during\nthe storage. Besides, we also realize the storage of a true-single-photon via\nFORTPT for the first time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 03:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

Traditional\nCT scanners' minimize such effect by taking more projections than necessary.

All users\ncan continuously harvest wireless power from the HAP until its transmission\nslot, i.e., the energy causality constraint is modeled by assuming that energy\nharvested in the future cannot be used for tranmission. Hence, latter users'\nenergy harvesting time is coupled with the transmission time of previous users.\nUnder this setup, we investigate the sum-throughput maximization (STM) problem\nand the total-time minimization (TTM) problem for the proposed multi-user\nfull-duplex wireless-powered network.

It is also shown that different user\nscheduling strategies should be used for STM and TTM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 06:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-03"}

These features are purposely\nexploited in different contexts ranging from natural products\nextraction/fractionation to aerospace propulsion. Large part of studies\nconcerns this last context, focusing on the dynamics of supercritical fluids at\nhigh Mach number where compressibility and thermodynamics strictly interact.\nDespite the widespread use also at low Mach number, the turbulent mixing\nproperties of slightly supercritical fluids have still not investigated in\ndetail in this regime. This topic is addressed here by dealing with Direct\nNumerical Simulations (DNS) of a coaxial jet of a slightly supercritical Van\nder Waals fluid. Since acoustic effects are irrelevant in the Low Mach number\nconditions found in many industrial applications, the numerical model is based\non a suitable low-Mach number expansion of the governing equation.

The mechanism of ligament formation at\nvanishing Mach number is extracted from the simulations and a detailed\nstatistical characterization is provided. Ligaments always form whenever a high\ndensity contrast occurs, independently of real or perfect gas behaviors. The\ndifference between real and perfect gas conditions is found in the ligament\nsmall-scale structure. More intense density gradients and thinner interfaces\ncharacterize the near critical fluid in comparison with the smoother behavior\nof the perfect gas.

This phenomena is studied in terms of the\nquantization of the electron energy spectra caused by the confinement of the\nelectron motion in the direction perpendicular to the sample. The calculated\nvalues of critical fields for different nanofilm thicknesses are analyzed in\nthe context of Clogston-Chandrasekhar limit. The influence of the thermal\neffect on the magnetic field induced superconductor to normal metal transition\nis also discussed. Furthermore, the thickness-dependence of the electron-phonon\ncoupling and its influence on the value of the critical magnetic field are\nstudied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 09:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Rev. E {\\bf 84}, 011125(2011)] leads to the\nappearance of an unusual active asymmetric phase, in which the system\nsublattices are unequally populated. It differs from the usual CP only by the\nfact that particles also interact with their next-nearest neighbor sites via a\ndistinct strength creation rate and for the inclusion of an inhibition effect,\nproportional to the local density. Aimed at investigating the robustness of\nsuch asymmetric phase, in this paper we study the influence of distinct\ninteractions for two bidimensional CPs. In the first model, the interaction\nbetween first neighbors requires a minimal neighborhood of adjacent particles\nfor creating new offspring, whereas second neighbors interact as usual (e.g. at\nleast one neighboring particle is required). The second model takes the\nopposite situation, in which the restrictive dynamics is in the interaction\nbetween next-nearest neighbors sites. Both models are investigated under mean\nfield theory (MFT) and Monte Carlo simulations. In similarity with results by\nMartins {\\it et. al.}, the inclusion of distinct sublattice interactions\nmaintain the occurrence of an asymmetric active phase and reentrant transition\nlines. In contrast, remarkable differences are presented, such as discontinuous\nphase transitions (even between the active phases), the appearance of\ntricritical points and the stabilization of active phases under larger values\nof control parameters. Finally, we have shown that the critical behaviors are\nnot altered due to the change of interactions, in which the absorbing\ntransitions belong to the directed percolation (DP) universality class, whereas\nsecond-order active phase transitions belong to the Ising universality class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 10:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The theoretical rationale relies on the hypothesis that\ncorrelated motions in proteins may be reconstructed as large-scale, collective\nmodes sustained by long-lived nonlinear vibrations known as discrete breathers\n(DB) localized at key, hot-spot sites. DBs are spatially localized modes, whose\nnonlinear nature hinders resonant coupling with the normal modes, thus\nconferring them long lifetimes as compared to normal modes. DBs have been\npredicted to exist in proteins, localized at few $hotspot$ residues typically\nwithin the stiffest portions of the structure. We compute DB modes analytically\nin the framework of the nonlinear network model, showing that the displacement\npatterns of many DBs localized at key sites match to a remarkable extent the\nexperimentally uncovered correlation blueprint. The computed dispersion\nrelations prove that it is physically possible for some of these DBs to be\nexcited out of thermal fluctuations at room temperature.\n  Based on our calculations, we speculate that transient energy redistribution\namong the vibrational modes in a protein might favor the emergence of DB-like\nbursts of long-lived energy at hot-spot sites with lifetimes in the ns range,\nable to sustain critical, function-encoding correlated motions.

The emergence\nof these self-consistent fields make shear flows significant sites for\nradiation emission and particle acceleration. We focus on electron-scale\ninstabilities, namely the collisionless, unmagnetized Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability (KHI) and a large-scale dc magnetic field generation mechanism on\nthe electron scales. We show that these processes are important candidates to\ngenerate magnetic fields in the presence of strong velocity shears, which may\nnaturally originate in energetic matter outburst of active galactic nuclei and\ngamma-ray bursters. We show that the KHI is robust to density jumps between\nshearing flows, thus operating in various scenarios with different density\ncontrasts. Multidimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the KHI,\nperformed with OSIRIS, reveal the emergence of a strong and large-scale dc\nmagnetic field component, which is not captured by the standard linear fluid\ntheory. This dc component arises from kinetic effects associated with the\nthermal expansion of electrons of one flow into the other across the shear\nlayer, whilst ions remain unperturbed due to their inertia. The electron\nexpansion forms dc current sheets, which induce a dc magnetic field. Our\nresults indicate that most of the electromagnetic energy developed in the KHI\nis stored in the dc component, reaching values of equipartition on the order of\n$10^{-3}$ in the electron time-scale, and persists longer than the proton\ntime-scale. Particle scattering/acceleration in the self generated fields of\nthese shear flow instabilities is also analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 13:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-03"}

Our study is based on the Jacobian,\nJ, of the transformation giving the emission coordinates in terms of the\ninertial ones.

It is classical, in\nthe sense that it admits the axiom schema of double negation, [DNE]. However,\nour understanding of {\\L}ukasiewicz logic can be improved by separating its\nclassical and intuitionistic aspects. The intuitionistic aspect of\n{\\L}ukasiewicz logic is captured in an axiom schema, [CWC], which asserts the\ncommutativity of a weak form of conjunction. This is equivalent to a very\nrestricted form of contraction. We show how {\\L}ukasiewicz Logic can be viewed\nboth as an extension of classical affine logic with [CWC], or as an extension\nof what we call \\emph{intuitionistic} {\\L}ukasiewicz logic with [DNE],\nintuitionistic {\\L}ukasiewicz logic being the extension of intuitionistic\naffine logic by the schema [CWC]. At first glance, intuitionistic affine logic\nseems very weak, but, in fact, [CWC] is surprisingly powerful, implying results\nsuch as intuitionistic analogues of De Morgan's laws. However the proofs can be\nvery intricate. We present these results using derived connectives to clarify\nand motivate the proofs and give several applications. We give an analysis of\nthe applicability to these logics of the well-known methods that use negation\nto translate classical logic into intuitionistic logic.

The thermodynamic hypothesis of Anfinsen\npostulates an universal energy function (UEF) characterizing the tertiary\nstructure, defined consistently across proteins, in terms of their aminoacid\nsequence.\n  We consider the approach of examining multiple protein structure descriptors\nin the PDB (Protein Data Bank), and infer individual preferences, biases\nfavoring particular classes of aminoacid interactions in each of them, later\naggregating these individual preferences into a global preference. This 2-step\nprocess would ideally expose intrinsic biases on classes of aminoacid\ninteractions in the UEF itself. The intuition is that any intrinsic biases in\nthe UEF are expressed within each protein in a specific manner consistent with\nits specific aminoacid sequence, size, and fold (consistently with Anfinsen's\nthermodynamic hypothesis), making a 1-step, holistic aggregation less\ndesirable.\n  Our intention is to illustrate how some impossibility results from voting\ntheory would apply in this setting, being possibly applicable to other protein\nfolding problems as well.

In the case of General Relativity, this problem is under study since\nthe theory was published. Several methods have been developed and different\napproaches are avalaible in the literature to interpret the relativistic\ncontributions in the motion under gravity influence. The main goal in this\nthesis is to study a general method to face the equation of motion for extended\nbodies in General Relativity. We started with a proposal in the Newtonian\ntheory, which consists in a multipolar expansion for the gravitational\npotentials as a function of the mass density moments and other physical\nvariables as the stress tensor. The methodology give us the equation of motion\nfor an isolated and self-gravitating system of extended bodies in Newtonian\nmechanics. A geometrical approach to get the equation of motion is also used\nfor the Newtonian problems, it allows us to extend the methodology to General\nRelativity. In General Relativity, some new concepts are necessary: world tube,\nworld line, generalized ideas of momentum, angular momentum, torque and center\nof mass are introduced in a general context. General expressions for the\nequation of motion in the case of extended bodies are written without any\nrestriction. In order to gain some physical understanding, we compute the\nPapapetrous's equation of motion for a test extended body in a static and\nisotropic metric. Finally, we study a system of two extended bodies in the\npost-Newtonian approximation. We define the mass multipole moments and momentum\nfrom the gravitational potentials (metric functions) to the first\npost-Newtonian order. We follow the Landau-Liftshitz formalism to find out the\nequation of motion for the moments and applying the standard coordinate\ntransformation for this theory, we write the traslational equation of motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 00:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-04"}
