These unique\nproperties often originate primarily from the quantum confinement of free\nelectrons in a potential well, while electron-electron interactions do not play\na decisive role. A recent experimental study shows that self-assembled Ir\nnanowires grown on Ge(001) surface have a strong length preference: the\nnanowire lengths are an integer multiple of 4.8 nm. In this paper, a free\nelectron-gas model for geometries corresponding to the nanowires is used to\nanalyze the selection of these preferred or magic lengths. The model shows that\nthe inclusion of even numbers of free electrons in an Ir nanowire corresponds\nto these magic lengths once an electron spillage effect is taken into account.\nThe model also shows that the stability of the nanowire diminishes with its\nincreasing length, and consequently suggests why no long nanowires are observed\nin experiments. It is also shown that applying generic results for quantum size\neffects in a nanofilm geometry is not adequate to accurately describe the\nlength selection in the rather different nanowire geometry, where the\ntransverse dimensions smaller than the electron Fermi wavelength. Finally, the\nmonatomic Au chain growth on Ge(001) surface is also analyzed. In contrast to\nIr nanowires, the model shows that the stability of an Au chain strongly\ndepends on its electron spillage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Apr 2014 16:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

This is because that the modes in lined ducts are not\npower-orthogonal; the total sound power is not equal to the sum of the sound\npower of each mode; cross-power terms may play important roles. In this paper,\nwe study sound propagation and attenuation in an infinite rigid duct lined with\na finite length of lining impedance. The lining impedance may be axial segments\nand circumferentially non-uniform. We propose two new physical quantities Kp\nand S to describe the self-overlap of the left eigenfunction and right\neigenfunction of one mode and the normalized overlap between modes,\nrespectively. The two new physical quantities describe totally the mode\nbehaviors in lined ducts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Apr 2014 19:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-08"}

This suggests that the SNRs\nare prime candidates for very-high-energy (VHE; E $>$ 0.1 TeV) {\\gamma}-ray\nobservations. G1.9+0.3, recently established as the youngest known SNR in the\nGalaxy, also offers a unique opportunity to study the earliest stages of SNR\nevolution in the VHE domain. The purpose of this work is to probe the level of\nVHE {\\gamma}-ray emission from both SNRs and use this to constrain their\nphysical properties. Observations were conducted with the H.E.S.S. (High Energy\nStereoscopic System) Cherenkov telescope array over a more than six-year period\nspanning 2004-2010. The obtained data have effective livetimes of 67 h for\nG1.9+0.3 and 16 h for G330.2+1.0. The data are analyzed in the context of the\nmulti-wavelength observations currently available and in the framework of both\nleptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios. No significant\n{\\gamma}-ray signal from G1.9+0.3 or G330.2+1.0 was detected. Upper limits (99%\nconfidence level) to the TeV flux from G1.9+0.3 and G330.2+1.0 for the assumed\nspectral index {\\Gamma} = 2.5 were set at 5.6 $\\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ above 0.26 TeV and 3.2 $\\times$ 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ above\n0.38 TeV, respectively.

Proposed\nmechanism is based on the intra-kernel high granularity pagers assignments per\nvirtual address space, which allow efficient and simple dispatching of page\nfaults to the appropriate pagers. The paging is one of the major features of\nthe virtual memory, which is extensively used by advanced operating systems to\nprovide an illusion of elastic memory. Original and present second generation\nmicrokernels provide only limited, inflexible and unnatural support for paging.\nFurthermore, facilities provided by current solutions for multi-pager support\non the runtime level introduce an overhead in terms of mode switches and thread\ncontext switches which can be significantly reduced.

The key difference is that WDM clusters have more\nextended and more massive subhaloes than CDM analogues. These massive\nsubstructures significantly stretch the critical lines and caustics and hence\nthey boost the lensing efficiency of the host halo. Despite the increase in the\nlensing efficiency due to the contribution of massive substructures in the WDM\nclusters, this is not enough to resolve the arc statistics problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2014 02:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In order to reduce the overhead to obtain full channel state\ninformation and to avoid the pilot contamination problem, by treating the\nscattered component as interference, we investigate a transmit and receive\nconjugate beamforming (BF) transmission scheme only based on the line-of-sight\n(LOS) component. Under Rank-1 model, we first consider a single-user system\nwith N transmit and M receive antennas, and focus on the problem of\npower-scaling law when the transmit power is scaled down proportionally to\n1/MN. It can be shown that as MN grows large, the scattered interference\nvanishes, and the ergodic achievable rate is higher than that of the\ncorresponding BF scheme based fast fading and minimum mean-square error (MMSE)\nchannel estimation. Then we further consider uplink and downlink single-cell\nscenarios where the base station (BS) has M antennas and each of K users has N\nantennas. When the transmit power for each user is scaled down proportionally\nto 1/MN, it can be shown for finite users that as M grows without bound, each\nuser obtains finally the same rate performance as in the single-user case. Even\nwhen N grows without bound, however, there still remains inter-user LOS\ninterference that can not be cancelled. Regarding infinite users, there exists\nsuch a power scaling law that when K and the b-th power of M go to infinity\nwith a fixed and finite ratio for a given b in (0, 1), not only inter-user LOS\ninterference but also fast fading effect can be cancelled, while fast fading\neffect can not be cancelled if b=1. Extension to multi-cells and\nfrequency-selective channels are also discussed shortly. Moreover, numerical\nresults indicate that spacial antenna correlation does not have serious\ninfluence on the rate performance, and the BS antennas may be allowed to be\nplaced compactly when M is very large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2014 04:44:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 09:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-09"}

The average parallel component is consistent with a\nrigidity independent spectrum, while the perpendicular component increases with\nGCR rigidity.

We analyze jointly the results of these three experiments\nand propose modifications of their analysis of the spectra to include in the\nmodel, in addition to the gravitational lensing and the inflationary\ngravitational waves components, also the effects induced by the cosmic\npolarization rotation (CPR), if it exists within current upper limits. Although\nin principle our analysis would lead also to new constraints on CPR, in\npractice these can only be given on its fluctuations <{\\delta}{\\alpha}^2>,\nsince constraints on its mean angle are inhibited by the de-rotation which is\napplied by current CMB polarization experiments, in order to cope with the\ninsufficient calibration of the polarization angle.

Firstly, we wish to point out that in Lee and McLachlan (2014b), which\npreceded this comparison, it is shown how a distribution belonging to the\nbroader class, the canonical fundamental skew t (CFUST) class, can be fitted\nwith essentially no additional computational effort than for the unrestricted\ndistribution. The CFUST class includes the restricted and unrestricted\ndistributions as special cases. Thus the user now has the option of letting the\ndata decide as to which model is appropriate for their particular dataset.\nSecondly, we wish to identify several statements in the comparison by Azzalini\net al.(2014) that demonstrate a serious misunderstanding of the reporting of\nresults in Lee and McLachlan (2014a) on the relative performance of these two\nskew t-distributions. In particular, there is an apparent misunderstanding of\nthe nomenclature that has been adopted to distinguish between these two models.\nThirdly, we take the opportunity to report here that we have obtained improved\nfits, in some cases a marked improvement, for the unrestricted model for\nvarious cases corresponding to different combinations of the variables in the\ntwo real datasets that were used in Azzalini et al.

Achieving a matching lower bound in a reasonable computational model is\none of the most important open problems in theoretical computer science.\n  In 2014, improving on his previous work, Ailon showed that if an algorithm\nspeeds up the FFT by a factor of $b=b(n)\\geq 1$, then it must rely on\ncomputing, as an intermediate \"bottleneck\" step, a linear mapping of the input\nwith condition number $\\Omega(b(n))$. Our main result shows that a factor $b$\nspeedup implies existence of not just one but $\\Omega(n)$ $b$-ill conditioned\nbottlenecks occurring at $\\Omega(n)$ different steps, each causing information\nfrom independent (orthogonal) components of the input to either overflow or\nunderflow. This provides further evidence that beating FFT is hard.

An accurate model of an accelerator must include realistic models of\nthe magnet fringe fields. Fringe fields for dipoles are well understood and can\nbe modelled at an early stage of accelerator design in such codes as MAD8, MADX\nor ELEGANT. However, usually it is not until the final stages of a design\nproject that it is possible to model fringe fields for quadrupoles or higher\norder multipoles. Even then, existing techniques rely on the use of a numerical\nfield map, which will usually not be available until the magnet design is well\ndeveloped. Substitutes for the full field map exist but these are typically\nbased on expansions about the origin and rely heavily on the assumption that\nthe beam travels more or less on axis throughout the beam line. In some types\nof machine (for example, a non-scaling FFAG such as EMMA) this is not a good\nassumption.\n  In this paper, a method for calculating fringe fields based on analytical\nexpressions is presented, which allows fringe field effects to be included at\nthe start of an accelerator design project. The magnetostatic Maxwell equations\nare solved analytically and a solution that fits all orders of multipoles\nderived. Quadrupole fringe fields are considered in detail as these are the\nones that give the strongest effects. Two examples of quadrupole fringe fields\nare presented. The first example is a magnet in the LHC inner triplet, which\nconsists of a set of four quadrupoles providing the final focus to the beam,\njust before the interaction point. Quadrupoles in EMMA provide the second\nexample. In both examples, the analytical expressions derived in this paper for\nquadrupole fringe fields provide a good approximation to the field maps\nobtained from a numerical magnet modelling code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2014 12:27:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 15:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-10"}

In a number\nof cases, the expansion of these derivatives and Laplacians in the circle\npolynomials are required. For the first-order partial derivatives, analytic\nresults are scattered in the literature, starting as early as 1942 in Nijboer's\nthesis and continuing until present day, with some emphasis on recursive\ncomputation schemes. A brief historic account of these results is given in the\npresent paper. By choosing the unnormalized version of the circle polynomials,\nwith exponential rather than trigonometric azimuthal dependence, and by a\nproper combination of the two partial derivatives, a concise form of the series\nexpressions emerges. This form is appropriate for the formulation and solution\nof a model wave-front sensing problem of reconstructing a wave-front on the\nlevel of its expansion coefficients from (measurements of the expansion\ncoefficients of) the partial derivatives. It turns out that the least-squares\nestimation problem arising here decouples per azimuthal order $m$, and per $m$\nthe generalized inverse solution assumes a concise analytic form, thereby\navoiding SVD-decompositions. The preferred version of the circle polynomials,\nwith proper combination of the partial derivatives, also leads to a concise\nanalytic result for the Zernike expansion of the Laplacian of the circle\npolynomials. From these expansions, the properties of the Laplacian as a\nmapping from the space of circle polynomials of maximal degree $N$, as required\nin the study of the Neumann problem associated with the Transport-of-Intensity\nequation, can be read off within a single glance. Furthermore, the inverse of\nthe Laplacian on this space is shown to have a concise analytic form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2014 12:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In\norder to generate such pulses we produced a filament in a 4 bar krypton cell.\nSpectral broadening by a factor of 2 to 3 of a 40 fs near infrared input pulse\nwas achieved. The spectrally broadened output pulses were then compressed by\nfused silica plates down to the few-cycle regime close to the Fourier limit.\nThe auto-correlation of these pulses revealed durations of about 3 cycles for\nall investigated central wavelengths. Pulses with a central wavelength of 1.7\num and up to 430 uJ energy per pulse were employed to generate high order\nharmonics in Xe, Ar and N2. Moving to near infrared few-cycle pulses opens the\npossibility to operate deeply in the non-perturbative regime with a Keldysh\nparameter smaller than 1.

This class unifies existing weighting methods, including\ncommonly used weights such as inverse-probability weights as special cases.\nGeneral large-sample results on nonparametric estimation based on these weights\nare derived. We further propose a new weighting scheme, the overlap weights, in\nwhich each unit's weight is proportional to the probability of that unit being\nassigned to the opposite group. The overlap weights are bounded, and minimize\nthe asymptotic variance of the weighted average treatment effect among the\nclass of balancing weights.

The study uses\n137,562 quasars in the redshift range $2.1\\le z \\le 3.5$ from the Data Release\n11 (DR11) of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of SDSS-III.\nThis sample contains three times the number of quasars used in previous\nstudies.

They consist of periodic arrays of alternating metal/dielectric\nlayers forming truncated square-based pyramids. The metallic layers of\nincreasing lengths play the role of vertically and, to a less extent, laterally\ncoupled plasmonic resonators. Based on detailed numerical simulations, we\ndemonstrate that plasmon hybridization between such resonators helps in\nachieving ultra-broadband absorption. The dipolar modes of individual\nresonators are shown to be prominent in the electromagnetic coupling mechanism.\nLateral coupling between adjacent pyramids and vertical coupling between\nalternating layers are proven to be key parameters for tuning of plasmon\nhybridization. Following optimization, the operational bandwidth of Au/Ge\npyramids, i.e. the bandwidth within which absorption is higher than 90%,\nextends over a 0.2-5.8 micrometers wavelength range, i.e. from UV-visible to\nmid-infrared, and total absorption (integrated over the operational bandwidth)\namounts to 98.0%. The omni-directional and polarization-independent\nhigh-absorption properties of the device are verified. Moreover, we show that\nthe choice of the dielectric layer material (Si versus Ge) is not critical for\nachieving ultra-broadband characteristics, which confers versatility for both\ndesign and fabrication. Realistic fabrication scenarios are briefly discussed.\nThis plasmon hybridization route could be useful in developing photothermal\ndevices, thermal emitters or shielding devices that dissimulate objects from\nnear infrared detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Apr 2014 15:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}

In a data center, there\nare a huge number of servers which consume a large amount of energy. In the\ncurrent technology, an idle server still consumes about 60\\% of its peak\nprocessing a job. Thus, the only way to save energy is to turn off servers\nwhich are not processing a job. However, when there are some waiting jobs, we\nhave to turn on the OFF servers. A server needs some setup time to be active\nduring which it consumes energy but cannot process a job. Therefore, there\nexists a trade-off between power consumption and delay performance.
