Our model is obtained by\nlinearizing an $l_1^+$-norm derived from the quadratic programming (QP) form of\nthe MRF energy. The resultant LP model contains significantly fewer variables\nand constraints compared to the conventional LP relaxation of the MRF energy.\nIn addition, unlike QP which can produce ambiguous labels, our model can be\nviewed as a quasi-total-variation minimization problem, and it can therefore\npreserve the discontinuities in the labels. We further establish a relaxation\nbound between our LP model and the conventional LP model. In the experiments,\nwe demonstrate our method for the task of interactive object segmentation. Our\nLP model outperforms QP when converting the continuous labels to binary labels\nusing different threshold values on the entire Oxford interactive segmentation\ndataset. The computational complexity of our LP is of the same order as that of\nthe QP, and it is significantly lower than the conventional LP relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2014 16:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-10"}

By performing a non-reciprocal motion, flexible\nfilaments can produce a net propulsive force, or pump fluid, in the absence of\ninertia. Inspired by such fundamental concept, we propose a strategy to produce\nmacroscopic pumping and mixing in creeping flow. We measure experimentally the\nnet motion of a Newtonian viscous fluid induced by the reciprocal motion of a\nflapper. When the flapper is rigid no net motion is induced. In contrast, when\nthe flapper is made of a flexible material, a net fluid pumping is measured. We\nquantify the effectiveness of this pumping strategy and show that optimal\npumping is achieved when the length of the flapper is on the same order as the\nelasto-hydrodynamic penetration length.

Our goal is to study the usability of this\nmethod on larger scale, and compare the properties of a filament using NIR\nscattering and other methods. We also study the radiation field and differences\nin grain emissivity between diffuse and dense areas. We have used scattered J,\nH, and K band surface brightness WFCAM-observations to map filament TMC-1N in\nTaurus, covering an area of 1dx1d corresponding to ~(2.44 pc)^2. We have\nconverted the data into optical depth and compared the results with NIR\nextinction and Herschel observations of submm dust emission. We see the\nfilament in scattered light in all three NIR bands. We note that our WFCAM\nobservations in TMC-1N show notably lower intensity than previous results in\nCorona Australis using the same method. We show that 3D radiative transfer\nsimulations predict similar scattered surface brightness levels as seen in the\nobservations. However, changing the assumptions about the background can change\nthe results of simulations notably. We derive emissivity by using optical depth\nin the J band as an independent tracer of column density. We obtain opacity\nsigma(250um) values 1.7-2.4x10^-25 cm^2/H, depending on assumptions of the\nextinction curve, which can change the results by over 40%. These values are\ntwice as high as obtained for diffuse areas, at the lower limit of earlier\nresults for denser areas. We show that NIR scattering can be a valuable tool in\nmaking high resolution maps. We conclude, however, that NIR scattering\nobservations can be complicated, as the data can show relatively low-level\nartefacts.

These facts have been widely interpreted to indicate that the\nSolar System is an atypical member of the overall population of planetary\nsystems. We report here on a strong anti-correlation of orbital eccentricity\nwith multiplicity (number of planets in the system) among catalogued radial\nvelocity (RV) systems. The mean, median and rough distribution of\neccentricities of Solar System planets fits an extrapolation of this\nanti-correlation to the eight planet case rather precisely despite the fact\nthat no more than 2 Solar System planets would be detectable with RV data\ncomparable to that in the exoplanet sample. Moreover, even if regarded as a\nsingle or double planetary system, the Solar System lies in a reasonably\nheavily populated region of eccentricity-multiplicity space. Thus, the Solar\nSystem is not anomalous among known exoplanetary systems with respect to\neccentricities when its multiplicity is taken into account. Specifically, as\nthe multiplicity of a system increases the eccentricity decreases roughly as a\npower law of index -1.20. A simple and plausible but ad hoc and model-dependent\ninterpretation of this relationship implies that approximately 80% of the one\nplanet and 25% of the two planet systems in our sample have additional, as yet\nundiscovered, members but that systems of higher observed multiplicity are\nlargely complete (i.e., relatively rarely contain additional undiscovered\nplanets).

Viable\ncandidates for light WIMP DM must fulfil stringent constraints. On the one\nhand, the observation at the LHC of a Higgs boson with Standard Model\nproperties set an upper bound on the coupling of light DM particles to the\nHiggs, thereby making it difficult to reproduce the correct relic abundance. On\nthe other hand, the recent results from direct searches in the CDMSlite,\nSuperCDMS and LUX experiments have set upper constraints on the DM scattering\ncross section. In this paper, we investigate the viability of light\nright-handed sneutrino DM in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Model (NMSSM)\nin the light of these constraints. To this aim, we have carried out a scan in\nthe NMSSM parameter space, imposing experimental bounds on the Higgs sector and\nlow-energy observables, such as the muon anomalous magnetic moment and\nbranching ratios of rare decays. We demonstrate that the enlarged Higgs sector\nof the NMSSM, together with the flexibility provided by the RH sneutrino\nparameters, make it possible to obtain viable RH sneutrino DM with a mass as\nlight as 2 GeV. We have also considered the upper bounds on the annihilation\ncross section from Fermi LAT data on dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and extracted\nspecific examples with mass in the range 8-50 GeV that could account for the\napparent low-energy excess in the gamma-ray emission at the Galactic Centre.\nThen, we have computed the theoretical predictions for the elastic scattering\ncross-section of RH sneutrinos.

In nearby galaxies the far-infrared-radio correlation indicates\nthe coupling between magnetic fields and star formation. The correlation arises\nfrom the synchrotron emission of cosmic ray electrons traveling through the\ninterstellar magnetic fields. However, with an increase of the interstellar\nradiation field (ISRF), inverse Compton scattering becomes the dominant energy\nloss mechanism of cosmic ray electrons with a typical emission frequency in the\nX-ray regime. The ISRF depends on the one hand on the star formation rate and\nbecomes stronger in starburst galaxies, and on the other hand increases with\nredshift due to the evolution of the cosmic microwave background. With a model\nfor the star formation rate of galaxies, the ISRF, and the cosmic ray spectrum,\nwe can calculate the expected X-ray luminosity resulting from the inverse\nCompton emission. Except for galaxies with an active galactic nucleus the main\nadditional contribution to the X-ray luminosity comes from X-ray binaries. We\nestimate this contribution with an analytical model as well as with an\nobservational relation, and compare it to the pure inverse Compton luminosity.\nUsing data from the Chandra Deep Field Survey and far-infrared observations\nfrom ALMA we then determine upper limits for the cosmic ray energy. Assuming\nthat the magnetic energy in a galaxy is in equipartition with the energy\ndensity of the cosmic rays, we obtain upper limits for the magnetic field\nstrength. Our results suggest that the mean magnetic energy of young galaxies\nis similar to the one in local galaxies. This points toward an early generation\nof galactic magnetic fields, which is in agreement with current dynamo\nevolution models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2014 19:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Although intrinsically more disperse than Supernovae\nIa, this relation constitutes an alternative distance indicator potentially\nable to probe, in an independent way, the expansion history of the Universe.\nWith this respect, we show that the new mission concept Athena should be able\nto measure the X-ray variability of hundreds of AGN and then constrain the\ndistance modulus with uncertainties of 0.1 mag up to z~0.6. We also discuss\nhow, using a new dedicated wide field X-ray telescope able to measure the\nvariability of thousands of AGNs, our estimator has the prospect to become a\ncosmological probe even more sensitive than current Supernovae Ia samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2014 20:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We also\nshow how the shape of the critical line in a solution controls the difference\nin concentration of the coexisting liquid phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2014 21:01:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 21:07:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 20:56:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-25"}

The binary is clearly resolved by Chandra and\nboth stars are detected as X-ray sources. The X-ray spectra of both stars\nreveal evidence for cool and hot plasma. Suprisingly, the X-ray luminosity of\nthe less-massive secondary is at least twice that of the primary and is\nvariable. The disparity is attributed to the primary whose X-ray luminosity is\nat the low end of the range for classical T Tauri stars of similar mass based\non established correlations.

This new magnetic inversion approach relies on the spectrum synthesis\ncalculations over the full wavelength range covered by observations and does\nnot assume that the LSD profiles behave as a single spectral line with mean\nparameters. We present magnetic and chemical abundance maps derived from the Si\nand Fe lines. Mean polarisation profiles of both elements reveal a significant\ndeparture of the magnetic field topology of CU Vir from the commonly assumed\naxisymmetric dipolar configuration. The field of CU Vir is dipolar-like, but\nclearly non-axisymmetric, showing a large difference of the field strength\nbetween the regions of opposite polarity. The main relative abundance depletion\nfeatures in both Si and Fe maps coincide with the weak-field region in the\nmagnetic map. Detailed information on the distorted dipolar magnetic field\ntopology of CU Vir provided by our study is essential for understanding\nchemical spot formation, radio emission, and rotational period variation of\nthis star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2014 22:24:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-21"}

In order to\nobtain the critical conditions for explosion as a function of mass accretion\nrate, neutrino luminosity, and specific angular momentum, rigidly rotating\nmatter was injected from the outer boundary with an angular momentum, which is\nincreased every 500 ms. It is found that there is a critical value of the\nspecific angular momentum, above which the standing shock wave revives, for a\ngiven combination of mass accretion rate and neutrino luminosity, i.e. an\nexplosion can occur by rotation even if the neutrino luminosity is lower than\nthe critical value for a given mass accretion rate in non-rotational models.\nThe coupling of rotation and hydrodynamical instabilities plays an important\nrole to characterize the dynamics of shock revival for the range of specific\nangular momentum that are supposed to be realistic. Contrary to expectations\nfrom past studies, the most rapidly expanding direction of the shock wave is\nnot aligned with the rotation axis. Being perpendicular to the rotation axis on\naverage, it can be oriented in various directions. Its dispersion is small when\nthe spiral mode of the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) governs the\ndynamics, while it is large when neutrino-driven convection is dominant. As a\nresult of the comparison between 2D and 3D rotational models, it is found that\nm=!0 modes of neutrino-driven convection or SASI are important for shock\nrevival around the critical surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2014 22:42:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Jul 2014 03:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-03"}

Small cells come with a significant challenge of providing\nbackhaul to transport data to(from) a gateway node in the core network. Fiber\nbased backhaul offers the high rates needed to meet this requirement, but is\ncostly and time-consuming to deploy, when not readily available. Wireless\nbackhaul is an attractive option for small cells as it provides a less\nexpensive and easy-to-deploy alternative to fiber. However, there are multitude\nof bands and features (e.g. LOS/NLOS, spatial multiplexing etc.) associated\nwith wireless backhaul that need to be used intelligently for small cells.\nCandidate bands include: sub-6 GHz band that is useful in non-line-of-sight\n(NLOS) scenarios, microwave band (6-42 GHz) that is useful in point-to-point\nline-of-sight (LOS) scenarios, and millimeter wave bands (e.g. 60, 70 and 80\nGHz) that are recently being commercially used in LOS scenarios. In many\ndeployment topologies, it is advantageous to use aggregator nodes, located at\nthe roof tops of tall buildings near small cells. These nodes can provide high\ndata rate to multiple small cells in NLOS paths, sustain the same data rate to\ngateway nodes using LOS paths and take advantage of all available bands.

Large and regular glitches observed in the\nVela pulsar have originally constrained the fraction of the stellar moment of\ninertia that must reside in the solid crust to about 1.4%. However, crustal\nentrainment-which until very recently has been ignored-suggests that in order\nto account for the Vela glitches, the fraction of the moment of inertia\nresiding in the crust must increase to about 7%. This indicates that the\nrequired angular momentum reservoir may exceed that which is available in the\ncrust. We explore the possibility that uncertainties in the equation of state\nprovide enough flexibility for the construction of models that predict a large\ncrustal thickness and consequently a large crustal moment of inertia. Given\nthat analytic results suggest that the crustal moment of inertia is sensitive\nto the transition pressure at the crust-core interface, we tune the parameters\nof the model to maximize the transition pressure, while still providing an\nexcellent description of nuclear observables. In this manner we are able to\nobtain fractional moments of inertia as large as 7% for neutron stars with\nmasses below 1.6 solar masses.

Because such structure usually leads to quasilocalized\nmodes of various kinds of bulk fields. In this paper, we construct a domain\nwall brane model by using a scalar field $\\phi$, which couples to its kinetic\nterm. The inner brane structure emerges as the scalar-kinetic coupling\nincreases. With such brane structure, we show that it is possible to obtain\ngravity resonant modes in both tensor and scalar sectors. The number of the\nresonant modes depends on the vacuum expectation value of $\\phi$ and the form\nof scalar-kinetic coupling. The correspondence between our model and the\ncanonical one is also discussed. The noncanonical and canonical background\nscalar fields are connected by an integral equation, while the warp factor\nremains the same. Via this correspondence, the canonical and noncanonical\nmodels share the same linear perturbation spectrum. So the gravity resonances\n{obtained} in the noncanonical frame can also be obtained in the standard\nmodel. However, due to the inequivalence between the corresponding background\nscalar solutions, the localization condition for the left-chiral fermion zero\nmode can be largely different in different frames. Our estimate shows that the\nmagnitude of the Yukawa coupling in the noncanonical frame might be hundreds\ntimes larger than the one in the canonical frame, if one demands the\nlocalization of the left-chiral fermion zero mode as well as the appearance of\na few gravity resonance modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 01:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-11"}

Simple\ncontagions, i.e., $k=1$, quickly spread to the entire network in small world\ngraphs. However, fast spreading of complex contagions appears to be less likely\nand more delicate; the successful cases depend crucially on the network\nstructure~\\cite{G08,Ghasemiesfeh:2013:CCW}.\n  Our main result shows that complex contagions can spread fast in a general\nfamily of time-evolving networks that includes the preferential attachment\nmodel~\\cite{barabasi99emergence}.

However, with any finite cooling rate, the system falls out of\nequilibrium at temperatures near $T_g(>T_{K})$, implying that the very\nexistence of the putative thermodynamic phase transition at $T_{K}$ can be\nquestioned. Recent studies of systems with randomly pinned particles have\nhinted that the thermodynamic glass transition may be observed in simulations\nand experiments carried out for liquids with randomly pinned particles. This\nexpectation is based on the results of approximate calculations that suggest\nthat the temperature of the thermodynamic glass transition increases as the\nconcentration of pinned particles is increased and it may be possible to\nequilibrate the system at temperatures near the increased transition\ntemperature. We test the validity of this prediction through extensive\nmolecular dynamics simulations of two model glass-forming liquids in the\npresence of random pinning. We fit the temperature-dependence of the structural\nrelaxation time to the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann form that predicts a divergence of\nthe relaxation time at a temperature $T_{VFT}$ and identify this temperature\nwith the thermodynamic transition temperature $T_K$. We find that $T_{VFT}$\ndoes not show any sign of increasing with increasing concentration of pinned\nparticles. The main effect of pinning is found to be a rapid decrease in the\nkinetic fragility of the system with increasing pin concentration.

However, for multihop networks some of these\ngeneralized polices address a number of critical weakness of the\nMaxWeight/BackPressure policies.\n  For multihop networks with fixed routing, we consider the Proportional\nScheduler (or (1,log)-policy). In this setting, the BackPressure policy is\nmaximum stable, but must maintain a queue for every route-destination, which\ntypically grows rapidly with a network's size. However, this proportionally\nfair policy only needs to maintain a queue for each outgoing link, which is\ntypically bounded in number. As is common with Internet routing, by maintaining\nper-link queueing each node only needs to know the next hop for each packet and\nnot its entire route. Further, in contrast to BackPressure, the Proportional\nScheduler does not compare downstream queue lengths to determine weights, only\nlocal link information is required. This leads to greater potential for\ndecomposed implementations of the policy. Through a reduction argument and an\nentropy argument, we demonstrate that, whilst maintaining substantially less\nqueueing overhead, the Proportional Scheduler achieves maximum throughput\nstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 08:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-11"}

Among other\napplications, Lie symmetries for several new and known generalizations of the\nreal Riccati equation are studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 08:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-24"}

After their birth, they form bubbles of\nhot gas surrounded by a dense shell. Traditionally, the formation of bubbles is\nexplained through the input of a powerful stellar wind, even though direct\nevidence supporting this scenario is lacking. Here we explore the possibility\nthat interstellar bubbles seen by the Spitzer- and Herschel space telescopes,\nblown by stars with log(L/L_sun) < 5.2, form and expand due to the thermal\npressure accompanying ionization of the surrounding gas. We show that density\ngradients in the natal cloud or a puncture in the swept up shell lead to an\nionized gas flow through the bubble into the general interstellar medium, which\nis traced by a dust wave near the star, demonstrating the importance of\nradiation pressure during this phase. Dust waves provide a natural explanation\nfor the presence of dust inside H II bubbles, offer a novel method to study\ndust in H II regions and provide direct evidence that bubbles are relieving\ntheir pressure into the ISM through a champagne flow, acting as a probe of the\nradiative interaction of a massive star with its surroundings.

One\nsuch technique that has found application in these domains is learning-based\nmodel predictive control (LBMPC). An important novelty of LBMPC lies in the\nfact that its robustness and stability properties are independent of the type\nof online learning used. This allows the use of advanced statistical or machine\nlearning methods to provide the adaptation for the controller. This paper is\nconcerned with providing practical comparisons of different optimization\nalgorithms for implementing the LBMPC method, for the special case where the\ndynamic model of the system is linear and the online learning provides linear\nupdates to the dynamic model. For comparison purposes, we have implemented a\nprimal-dual infeasible start interior point method that exploits the sparsity\nstructure of LBMPC. Our open source implementation (called LBmpcIPM) is\navailable through a BSD license and is provided freely to enable the rapid\nimplementation of LBMPC on other platforms. This solver is compared to the\ndense active set solvers LSSOL and qpOASES using a quadrotor helicopter\nplatform. Two scenarios are considered: The first is a simulation comparing\nhovering control for the quadrotor, and the second is on-board control\nexperiments of dynamic quadrotor flight. Though the LBmpcIPM method has better\nasymptotic computational complexity than LSSOL and qpOASES, we find that for\ncertain integrated systems (like our quadrotor testbed) these methods can\noutperform LBmpcIPM. This suggests that actual benchmarks should be used when\nchoosing which algorithm is used to implement LBMPC on practical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 15:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-11"}

In the simplest case, (X,Y) represent data pairs of\nabscissa and ordinate, in which case the analysis deals with the case of data\npairs with errors in both coordinates, but X can be any measured quantities on\nwhich Y depends. The analysis applies for arbitrary covariance, provided all\nerrors are gaussian, and provided the errors in X are small, both in comparison\nwith the scale over which the expected signal Y changes, and with the width of\nthe prior distribution. This generalises the Fisher Matrix approach, which\nnormally only considers errors in the `ordinate' Y.

The foams we investigate have large bubble size, to minimize the\neffects of coarsening, and are very dry. Foams of this type cannot be studied\nvia conventional rheometry. The foam flows upward through a vertical\nrectangular column with a 4:1 cross-sectional aspect ratio, by bubbling gas\nthrough a soapy solution at the base of our apparatus. At the column's narrow\nsurfaces are sticky boundaries, which create shear due to the zero velocity\nboundary condition. As expected, the flow profile between the adjacent slippery\nbroad faces is flat, however the profile between the narrow, sticky faces\nexhibits a curved velocity profile that is dependent on gas flow rate. We are\nable to analyze a 2d velocity profile from a 3d bulk system. We employ particle\nimage velocimetry to measure the strain rate, and compute the stress from the\npressure drop along the channel, to investigate the local stress-strain\nrelationships in a flowing foam.

However there\nis currently a desire to see the region transition towards a more bio-based\neconomy. New bio-related industries are being situated in the region as a\nconsequence of policy and economic incentives. Many of these industries are\nconnected through their supply chains, either directly, or by sharing common\nsuppliers or customers and the growth or decline of one industry can hence have\nimpacts on many others. Therefore an important question to consider is what\neffect this movement towards bio-based industry will actually have on the\nregional economy as a whole.

This\ndynamical model has been applied to the Humber region in order to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of how the region may develop. The model suggests that the\ntransition to a bio-based economy will occur with oil refining losing its\ndominance to bioethanol production and biological chemical production, whilst\nanaerobic digestion grows as a major source of electricity, in turn driving up\nthe value of regional waste aggregators and arable farming in the overall\neconomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 15:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-14"}

Here,\nwe derive formulas for the tip-sample conservative and dissipative interactions\nand investigate the effect that spurious resonances have on the measured\ninteraction. Both direct and acoustic excitation are considered. We also\nhighlight the differences between measuring directly the tip position or the\ncantilever deflection. We show that, when probing the tip-sample forces, the\nacoustically excited cantilever behavior is insensitive to spurious resonances\nas long as the measured signal corresponds to the tip position, or if the\nexcitation force is correctly taken into account. Since the effective\nexcitation force may depend on the presence of such spurious resonances, we\nconsider the cases where the frequency is kept constant during the measurement\nso that the proportionality between excitation signal and actual excitation\nforce is kept constant. With the present work we show the advantages that\nresult from the use of a calibration method based on the acquisition of\napproach-retract curves. Optical beam deflection based AFMs benefit from the\nuse of this calibration method, especially in presence of spurious resonances\nin the cantilever transfer function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 02:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

In this paper, we\nanalyze an optical fiber system by evaluating MI as the maximum achievable rate\nof transmission of such a system. MI is estimated by means of histograms for\nwhich the correct bin number is determined in a blind way. The MI estimate\nobtained this way shows excellent accuracy in comparison with the true MI of\n16-state quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over an additive white Gaussian\nnoise channel with additional phase noise, which is a simplified model of a\nnonlinear optical fiber channel. We thereby justify to use the MI estimation\nmethod to accurately estimate the MI of an optical fiber system. In the second\npart of this work, a transoceanic fiber system with 6000 km of standard\nsingle-mode fiber is simulated and its MI determined. Among rectangular QAMs,\n16-QAM is found to be the optimal modulation scheme for this link as to\nperformance in terms of MI and requirements on components and digital signal\nprocessing. For the reported MI of 3.1 bits/symbol, a minimum coding overhead\nof 29% is required when the channel memory is not taken into account. By\nemploying ideal single-channel digital back-propagation, an increase in MI by\n0.25 bits/symbol and 0.28 bits/symbol is reported for 16-QAM and 64-QAM,\nrespectively, lowering the required overhead to 19% and 16%. When the channel\nspacing is decreased to be close to the Nyquist rate, the dual-polarization\nspectral efficiency is 5.7 bits/s/Hz, an increase of more than 2 bits/symbol\ncompared to a 50 GHz spacing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 08:56:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2015 14:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-20"}

The key point is: If\nantiparticles have negative gravitational charge, the quantum vacuum, well\nestablished in the Standard Model of Particles and Fields, contains virtual\ngravitational dipoles. The main conclusions are: (1) the physical vacuum\nenriched with gravitational dipoles is compatible with a cyclic universe\nalternatively dominated by matter and antimatter, without initial singularity\nand without need for cosmic inflation; (2) the virtual dipoles might explain\nthe phenomena usually attributed to dark matter and dark energy.
