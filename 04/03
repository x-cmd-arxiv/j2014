Due to NWRAMs regular grid based layout\nand innovative circuit style, manufacturing complexity is reduced and at the\nsame time considerable benefits are attained in terms of performance and\nleakage power reduction. In this paper, we elaborate more on NWRAM circuit\naspects and manufacturability, and quantify benefits at 16nm technology node\nthrough simulation against state-of-the-art 6T-SRAM and gridded 8T-SRAM\ndesigns. Our results show the 10T-NWRAM to be 2x faster and 35x better in terms\nof leakage when compared to high performance gridded 8T-SRAM design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 17:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-03"}

It is shown that, in EE, a positive dark energy density requires a\nLagrangian leading to quantum ghosts, whereas VT is free from these ghosts. On\naccount of this fact, the remainder of the paper is devoted to study cosmology\nin the framework of VT. Initial conditions, at high redshift, are used to solve\nthe evolution equations of all the VT scalar modes. In particular, a certain\nscalar mode characteristic of VT -which does not appear in general relativity\n(GR)- is chosen in such a way that it evolves separately. In other words, the\nscalar modes of the standard model based on GR do not affect the evolution of\nthe VT characteristic mode; however, this scalar mode influences the evolution\nof the standard GR ones. Some well known suitable codes (CMBFAST and COSMOMC)\nhave been modified to include our VT initial conditions and evolution\nequations, which are fully general.

If we define\nhabitability as the ability of a planet to beget life, then probably not. After\nall, life on Earth has developed within only about 800 Myr after its formation.\nIf, however, we define habitability as our ability to detect life on the\nsurface of exoplanets, then age becomes a crucial parameter.

Using a recursive\nargument, we obtain our second structural result, showing that any degree $d$\npolynomial $f$ induces a partition of $F^n$ to affine subspaces of dimension\n$\\Omega(n^{1/(d-1)!})$, such that $f$ is constant on each part.\n  We extend both structural results to more than one polynomial.

This restriction to uniformity is more a matter of convenience than of\nnecessity, and it is important to investigate distances induced by more general\ndistributions.\n  In this paper, we make significant strides in this direction.

In the first case\nthe refinement parameter f is rescaled (f -> f/2) each time the flat-histogram\ncondition is satisfied, in the second f ~ 1/t after a suitable initial phase,\nwhile in the third f is constant (t corresponds to Monte Carlo time). To\nexamine the intrinsic convergence properties of these methods, free of any\ncomplications associated with a specific model, we study a featureless entropy\nlandscape, such that for each allowed energy E = 1,...,L, there is exactly one\nstate, that is, g(E) = 1 for all E. Convergence of sampling corresponds to\ng(E,t) -> const. as t -> infinity, so that the standard deviation sigma_g of g\nover energy values is a measure of the overall sampling error. Neither the WL\nalgorithm nor TS converge: in both cases sigma_g saturates at long times. In\nthe 1/t algorithm, by contrast, sigma_g decays \\propto 1/\\sqrt{t}. Modified TS\nand 1/t procedures, in which f \\propto 1/t^alpha, converge for alpha values\nbetween 0 and 1.

The blueshifted outflow shows two distinct components in [Fe II] 1.644\nmicron emission, which are separated using multi-component line fitting. A\nstationary recollimation shock is observed, in agreement with previous X-ray\nand FUV observations. The presence of this shock indicates that the innermost\nstreamlines of the high-velocity component are launched at a very small radius,\n0.01-0.15 AU, from the central star. The jet accelerates and expands downstream\nof the recollimation shock; the 'acceleration' is likely a sign of velocity\nvariations in the jet. No evidence of rotation is found, and we compare this\nnon-detection to previous counter-claims. Moving jet knots, likely the result\nof the jet velocity variations, are observed. One of these knots moves more\nslowly than previously observed knots, and the knot ejection interval appears\nto be non-periodic. An intermediate-velocity component surrounds this central\njet, and is interpreted as the result of a turbulent mixing layer along the jet\nboundaries.

The work is also of interest\nbecause there are nontrivial correlations between the neurons even in the\nasymptotic limit, thereby presenting itself as a generalisation of traditional\nmean-field models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 23:06:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 16:32:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 14:51:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2016 12:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

These 2D\ntopological indices give rise to stable 2D surface Dirac cones, which can be\ndeformed to Fermi arcs when the surface states couple to the bulk states on the\nFermi level.

The stress\nrelaxation modulus at different temperatures G(t,T) was calculated by the\nGreen-Kubo relation. The TTS of G(t,T) of bead-spring polymer melts worked well\nat temperatures sufficiently higher than its Tg. However, when the system\ntemperature is approaching the glass transition regime, the breakdown of TTS is\nobserved. At temperatures near the Tg, the temperature dependence of the shift\nfactor aTB, which is defined at the time scale between the bond relaxation and\nthe chain relaxation regimes of a G(t)-function, is significantly stronger than\nones aTA defined by the time scale of the chain relaxation modes.

Recent developments in the theory and numerical modeling of\npolarization in spectral lines have suggested that information on the magnetic\nfield of the chromosphere-corona transition region could be obtained by\nmeasuring the linear polarization of the solar disk radiation at the core of\nthe hydrogen Lyman-$\\alpha$ line at 121.6~nm, which is produced by scattering\nprocesses and the Hanle effect. The Chromospheric Lyman-$\\alpha$\nSpectropolarimeter (CLASP) sounding rocket experiment aims to measure the\nintensity (Stokes $I$) and the linear polarization profiles ($Q/I$ and $U/I$)\nof the hydrogen Lyman-$\\alpha$ line. In this paper we clarify the information\nthat the Hanle effect can provide by applying a Stokes inversion technique\nbased on a database search. The database contains all theoretical $Q/I$ and\n$U/I$ profiles calculated in a one-dimensional semi-empirical model of the\nsolar atmosphere for all possible values of the strength, inclination, and\nazimuth of the magnetic field vector, though this atmospheric region is highly\ninhomogeneous and dynamic.

Non-spherical gravitational potentials couple the spin states to the\norbit state and chaotically drive the system towards the observed asteroid\nclasses along two evolutionary tracks primarily distinguished by mass ratio.\nRelated to this is a new binary process termed secondary fission - the\nsecondary asteroid of the binary system is rotationally accelerated via\ngravitational torques until it fissions, thus creating a chaotic ternary\nsystem. The initially chaotic binary can be stabilized to create a synchronous\nbinary by components of the fissioned secondary asteroid impacting the primary\nasteroid, solar gravitational perturbations, and mutual body tides.

Here,\n$w_{\\infty}$ and $\\omega$ are the free-stream and the body rotation velocities\nrespectively, and $\\nu$ is the fluid kinematic viscosity. The spectrum and the\neigenfunctions obtained allow us to explain the different bifurcations from the\naxisymmetric state observed in previous numerical studies. Our results reveal\nthat three global eigenmodes, denoted Low-Frequency (LF), Medium-Frequency (MF)\nand High-Frequency (HF) modes, become unstable in different regions of the\n$Re-\\Omega$ parameter plane. We provide precise computations of the\ncorresponding neutral curves, that divide the $Re-\\Omega$ plane into four\ndifferent regions: the stable axisymmetric flow prevails for small enough\nvalues of $Re$ and $\\Omega$, while three different frozen states, where the\nwake structures co-rotate with the body at different angular velocities, take\nplace as a consequence of the destabilization of the LF, MF and HF modes.\nSeveral direct numerical simulations of the nonlinear state associated to the\nMF mode, identified here for the first time, are also reported to complement\nthe linear stability results. Finally, we point out the important fact that,\nsince the axisymmetric base flow is $SO(2)$-symmetric, the theory of\nequivariant bifurcations implies that the weakly non-linear regimes that emerge\nclose to criticality must necessarily take the form of rotating-wave states.\nThese states, previously referred to as frozen wakes in the literature, are\nthus shown to result from the base-flow symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 08:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

Prior work in this field dealt separately with\ncooperation and partial cribbing. However, by combining these two methods we\ncan achieve significantly higher rates. Remarkably, the capacity region does\nnot require an additional auxiliary random variable (RV) since the purpose of\nboth cooperation and partial cribbing is to generate a common message between\nthe encoders. In the proof we combine methods of block Markov coding, backward\ndecoding, double rate-splitting, and joint typicality decoding. Furthermore, we\npresent the Gaussian MAC with combined one-sided cooperation and quantized\ncribbing. For this model, we give an achievability scheme that shows how many\ncooperation or quantization bits are required in order to achieve a Gaussian\nMAC with full cooperation/cribbing capacity region. After establishing our main\nresults, we consider two cases where only one auxiliary RV is needed. The first\nis a rate distortion dual setting for the MAC with a common message, a private\nmessage and combined cooperation and cribbing. The second is a state-dependent\nMAC with cooperation, where the state is known at a partially cribbing encoder\nand at the decoder. However, there are cases where more than one auxiliary RV\nis needed, e.g., when the cooperation and cribbing are not used for the same\npurposes. We present a MAC with an action-dependent state, where the action is\nbased on the cooperation but not on the cribbing. Therefore, in this case more\nthan one auxiliary RV is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 10:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-04"}

We reobserved the galaxy in high spatial\nresolution using the VIMOS integral-field unit (IFU) at the VLT with a spaxel\nsize of 0.67 arcsec. Furthermore, we use long slit high resolution data from\nHIRES/Keck at two different slit positions covering the GRB site, the center of\nthe galaxy and an HII region next to the GRB region. We compare the properties\nof different HII regions in the galaxy with the GRB site and study the global\nand local kinematic properties of this galaxy. The resolved data show that the\nGRB site has the lowest metallicity in the galaxy with around 1/3 Z_solar, but\nits specific SFR (SSFR) of 7.4 M_solar/yr/L/L* and age (determined by the\nHalpha EW) are similar to other HII regions in the host. The galaxy shows a\ngradient in metallicity and SSFR from the bulge to the outskirts as it is\ncommon for spiral galaxies. This gives further support to the theory that GRBs\nprefer regions of higher star-formation and lower metallicity, which, in S-type\ngalaxies, are more easily found in the spiral arms than in the centre.\nKinematic measurements of the galaxy do not show evidence for large\nperturbations but a minor merger in the past cannot be excluded.

An upper\nlimit to the characteristic size of galaxies may be defined by the critical\nradius beyond which radiation pressure on dust is no longer able to drive the\nshell.

Here we report on a membrane-less,\nhydrogen bromine laminar flow battery as a potential high power density\nsolution. The membrane-less design enables power densities of 0.795 W cm$^{-2}$\nat room temperature and atmospheric pressure, with a round-trip voltage\nefficiency of 92\\% at 25\\% of peak power. Theoretical solutions are also\npresented to guide the design of future laminar flow batteries. The high power\ndensity achieved by the hydrogen bromine laminar flow battery, along with the\npotential for rechargeable operation, will translate into smaller, inexpensive\nsystems that could revolutionize the fields of large-scale energy storage and\nportable power systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 14:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

However, we do not find any credible optical source\nwithin early observations with BOOTES-4/MET and 1.5m OSN telescopes.\nSpectroscopic observation of this galaxy by GTC showed a single faint emission\nline that likely corresponds to [OII] 3727\\{AA} at a redshift of 1.250+/-0.001\nimplying a SFR(M_sun/yr) > 6.18 M_sun/yr without correcting for dust\nextinction. The probable extinction was revealed through analysis of the\nafterglow SED, resulting in a value of AV >= ~ 0.9 at the rest frame, this is\ncomparable to extinction levels found among other dark GRBs. The SED of the\nhost galaxy is explained well (chi2/d.o.f.=0.564) by a luminous (MB=-21.16),\nlow-extinction (AV =0, rest frame), and aged (2.6 Gyr) stellar population. We\ncan explain this apparent contradiction in global and line-of-sight extinction\nif the GRB birth place happened to lie in a local dense environment. In light\nof having relatively small specific SFR (SSFR) ~ 5.3 M_sun/yr (L/L_star)-1,\nthis also could explain the age of the old stellar population of host galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 14:41:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 16:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

Multilevel sampling methods aim to achieve the same accuracy as\ntraditional sampling methods, but at a reduced computational cost, through the\nuse of a hierarchy of spatial discretization models. Multilevel algorithms\ncoordinate the number of samples needed at each discretization level by\nminimizing the computational cost, subject to a given error tolerance. They can\nbe applied to a variety of sampling schemes, exploit nesting when available,\ncan be implemented in parallel and can be used to inform adaptive spatial\nrefinement strategies.

This approximation\ncannot capture the stochastic nature of the process and, consequently, it can\nprovide an erroneous view of the behavior of the Markov chain if the indexing\nparameter is not sufficiently high. Important phenomena that cannot be revealed\ninclude non-negligible variance and bi-modal population distributions. A\nless-known approximation proposed by Kurtz applies stochastic differential\nequations (SDEs) and provides information about the stochastic nature of the\nprocess. In this paper we apply and extend this diffusion approximation to\nstudy stochastic Petri nets. We identify a class of nets whose underlying\nstochastic process is a density dependent Markov chain whose indexing parameter\nis a multiplicative constant which identifies the population level expressed by\nthe initial marking and we provide means to automatically construct the\nassociated set of SDEs. Since the diffusion approximation of Kurtz considers\nthe process only up to the time when it first exits an open interval, we extend\nthe approximation by a machinery that mimics the behavior of the Markov chain\nat the boundary and allows thus to apply the approach to a wider set of\nproblems. The resulting process is of the jump-diffusion type. We illustrate by\nexamples that the jump-diffusion approximation which extends to bounded domains\ncan be much more informative than that based on ODEs as it can provide accurate\nquantity distributions even when they are multi-modal and even for relatively\nsmall population levels. Moreover, we show that the method is faster than\nsimulating the original Markov chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 15:34:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-04"}
