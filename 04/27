If the structure\nis already known, information on the covarying positions can be valuable to\nunderstand the protein mechanism.\n  In this study we have sought to determine whether a multivariate extension of\ntraditional mutual information (MI) can be an additional tool to study\ncovariation. The performance of two multidimensional MI (mdMI) methods,\ndesigned to remove the effect of ternary/quaternary interdependencies, was\ntested with a set of 9 MSAs each containing <400 sequences, and was shown to be\ncomparable to that of methods based on maximum entropy/pseudolikelyhood\nstatistical models of protein sequences.

We found that the reason why\nmethods that derive partial correlation between the columns of a MSA provide a\nbetter recognition of close contacts is not because they remove chaining\neffects, but because they filter out the correlation between distant residues\nthat originates from general fitness constraints.

That is, each file\nis divided into k equal-sized chunks, which are then expanded into n chunks\nsuch that any k chunks out of the n are sufficient to successfully restore the\noriginal file. The model can be depicted as a multiple-server queue with\narrivals of data retrieving requests and a server corresponding to a thread.\nHowever, this is not a typical queueing model because a server can terminate\nits operation, depending on when other servers complete their service (due to\nthe redundancy that is spread across the threads). Hence, to the best of our\nknowledge, the analysis of this queueing model remains quite uncharted.\n  Recent traces from Amazon S3 show that the time to retrieve a fixed size\nchunk is random and can be approximated as a constant delay plus an i.i.d.\nexponentially distributed random variable.

However,\nobtaining this information is costly in terms of bandwidth, time, and power,\nand could result in large overhead. Therefore, a critical question is how to\noptimally manage network resources in the absence of such information. To that\nend, we develop a cross-layer solution for downlink cellular systems with\nimperfect (and possibly no) CSI at the transmitter. We use rateless codes to\nresolve channel uncertainty. To keep the decoding complexity low, we explicitly\nincorporate time-average block-size constraints, and aim to maximize the system\nutility. The block-size of a rateless code is determined by both the network\ncontrol decisions and the unknown CSI of many time slots. Therefore, unlike\nstandard utility maximization problems, this problem can be viewed as a\nconstrained partial observed Markov decision problem (CPOMDP), which is known\nto be hard due to the \"curse of dimensionality.\" However, by using a modified\nLyapunov drift method, we develop a dynamic network control scheme, which\nyields a total network utility within O(1/Lav) of utility-optimal point\nachieved by infinite block-size channel codes, where Lav is the enforced value\nof the time-average block-size of rateless codes.

Using several\ndifferent one-dimensional models, we characterize $S=1/2$ spinon excitations\nusing the spinon size and confinement length (the size of a bound state).

The tidal sub-space\nbasis can be derived via Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of a\ntidal record of a single buoy. Decomposition of a tsunami buoy record in a\nfunctional space of tidal EOFs presents an efficient tool for a short-term\ntidal forecast, as well as for an accurate tidal removal (Tolkova, E. 2009.\nPrincipal Component Analysis of Tsunami Buoy Record: Tide Prediction and\nRemoval. Dyn. Atmos. Oceans, 46 (1-4): 62-82.) EOF analysis of a time series,\nhowever, assumes that the time series represents a stationary (in the weak\nsense) process. In the present work, a modification of one-dimensional EOF\nformalism not restricted to stationary processes is introduced. With this\nmodification, the EOF-based de-tiding/forecasting technique can be interpreted\nin terms of a signal passage through a filter bank, which is unique for the\nsub-space spanned by the EOFs. This interpretation helps to identify a harmonic\ncontent of a continuous process whose fragments are decomposed by given EOFs.\nIn particular, seven EOFs and a constant function are proved to decompose\n1-day-long tidal fragments at any location. Filtering by projection into a\nreduced sub-space of the above EOFs is capable of separating a tsunami wave\nfrom a tidal component within a few millimeter accuracy from the first minutes\nof the tsunami appearance on a tsunami buoy record, and is reliable in the\npresence of data gaps. EOFs with ~3-day duration (a reciprocal of either tidal\nband width) allow short-term (24.75 hour in advance) tidal predictions using\nthe inherent structure of a tidal signal. The predictions do not require any a\npriori knowledge of tidal processes at a particular location, except for recent\n49.5 hour long recordings at the location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Apr 2014 06:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-29"}

In this case, noise is best represented\nby the Generalized Gaussian (GG) noise model with a shaping parameter $\\beta$.\nOn the other hand, fading in the UWA channel is generally represented using an\n$\\alpha$-$\\mu$ distribution, which is a generalization of a wide range of well\nknown fading distributions.

At infinite dilution,\nhysteresis is caused by the large difference in frictional drag coefficient\nbetween undeformed isotropic polymer coils and highly stretched conformations.\nAt the low extension rates in the hysteresis regime, stretched molecules\npervade larger volumes than equilibrium coils since the flow is too weak to\nsuppress transverse fluctuations. The onset of intermolecular overlap occurs\nfor such stretched conformations at polymer concentrations much smaller than\nc*, the conventional critical overlap concentration for equilibrium coils.\nTherefore, for a range of concentrations c < c*, intramolecular hydrodynamic\ninteractions may be significantly screened in stretched conformations. Scaling\narguments based on \"blob\" concepts are used here to argue that the stretched\nstate drag coefficient can grow strongly with concentration in the dilute\nregime.

Our photometric study confirms that the\nwidth of the main sequence close to the turn off point is entirely accounted\nfor by binary stars and differential reddening, with no need to advocate more\nsofisticated scenarios, such as metallicity spread or multiple main sequences.\nBy constructing synthetic color-magnitude diagrams, we infer that the binary\nfraction has to be as large as 30$%$ and their mass ratio in the range 0.6-1.0.\nAs a by-product of our simulations, we provide new estimates of the cluster\nfundamental parameters. We measure a reddening E(B-V)=0.15$\\pm$0.02, and\nconfirm the presence of a marginal differential reddening. The distance to the\ncluster is $4.7^{+0.2}_{-0.1} $kpc and the age is 3.4$\\pm$0.3 Gyr, which is\nsomewhat younger and better constrained than previous estimates. Our detailed\nabundance analysis reveals that, overall, Melotte~66 looks like a typical\nobject of the old thin disk population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Apr 2014 13:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

For this purpose we consider the TMD evolution for general\ncolorless scalar boson production, from the lower mass $C$-even scalar\nquarkonium states $\\chi_{c0}$ and $\\chi_{b0}$ to the Higgs mass scale. In the\nabsence of an intrinsic nonperturbative linearly polarized gluon distribution\nthe results correspond to the CSS formalism, indicating a rather rapid decrease\nwith increasing energy scale. At the Higgs mass scale the contribution from\nlinearly polarized gluons is in this case found to be on the percent level,\nsomewhat larger than an earlier finding in the literature. At the lower mass\nscale of quarkonium states $\\chi_{c0}$ and $\\chi_{b0}$ we find contributions at\nthe 15-70% level, albeit with considerable uncertainty. In the presence of an\nintrinsic linear gluon polarization, percent level effects are also found at\nthe Higgs mass scale, but with a considerably slower evolution. Although these\nresults were obtained using a model for the TMDs that are approximately\nGaussian at small transverse momenta and have the correct perturbative power\nlaw fall off at large transverse momenta, it illustrates well the differences\nthat can exist between results obtained from a TMD formalism as compared to a\nCSS formalism. The behavior of the TMDs at small $p_T$ can affect the results\nfor all transverse momenta of the produced boson, even for a particle as heavy\nas the Higgs. The TMD evolution from $\\chi_{c0}$ to $\\chi_{b0}$ may be used to\nconstrain the nonperturbative contributions and improve on the prediction of\nthe effect at the Higgs mass scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Apr 2014 14:12:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 07:24:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 10:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

A moderately strong\nelectric field is assumed to provide the streaming regime where each free\ncharge carrier, an electron or a hole, accelerates quasiballistically in the\n\"passive\" region until reaching the optical-phonon energy, then emits an\noptical phonon and starts the next period of acceleration. The inclusion of\nspin degree of freedom into the streaming-regime kinetics gives rise to rich\nand interesting spin-related phenomena. Firstly, in the streaming regime the\nspin relaxation is substantially modified, and the current-induced spin\norientation is remarkably increased. Under short-pulsed photoexcitation at the\nbottom of conduction band the photoelectrons execute a periodic damped motion\nin the energy space with the period equal to the free flight time of an\nelectron in the passive region. If the short optical pulse is circularly\npolarized so that the photocarriers are spin oriented, then the spin energy\ndistribution is oscillating in time as well, which can be detected in the\npump-probe time-resolved experiments.

We formulate the above problem as\na non-cooperative game. We consider two scenarios-i) when the region is small,\nii) when the region is large. In the first setting, we focus on a class of\nconflict graphs, known as mean valid graphs which commonly arise when the\nregion is small. We explicitly compute a symmetric Nash equilibrium (NE); the\nNE is threshold type in that primaries only choose independent set whose\ncardinality is greater than a certain threshold. The threshold on the\ncardinality increases with increase in quality of the channel on sale. We show\nthat the symmetric NE strategy profile is unique in a special class of conflict\ngraphs (linear graph). In the second setting, we consider node symmetric\nconflict graphs which arises when the number of locations is large\n(potentially, infinite). We explicitly compute a symmetric NE that randomizes\nequally among the maximum independent sets at a given channel state vector. In\nthe NE a primary only selects the maximum independent set at a given channel\nstate vector. We show that the two symmetric NEs computed in two settings\nexhibit important structural difference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Apr 2014 15:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Nov 2014 16:17:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2015 15:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

In the region inside the shell and for non-Neumann boundary\nconditions, the Bunch-Davies vacuum is a physically realizable state for all\nvalues of the mass and curvature coupling parameter.
