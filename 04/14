The heritability\ndetermines how the variance is shared between the different random components\nof a linear mixed model. The main novelty of our approach is to consider that\nthe random effects can be sparse, that is may contain null components, but we\ndo not know neither their proportion nor their positions. The estimator that we\nconsider is strongly inspired by the one proposed by Pirinen et al. (2013), and\nis based on a maximum likelihood approach. We also study the theoretical\nproperties of our estimator, namely we establish that our estimator of the\nheritability is $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent when both the number of observations $n$\nand the number of random effects $N$ tend to infinity under mild assumptions.\nWe also prove that our estimator of the heritability satisfies a central limit\ntheorem which gives as a byproduct a confidence interval for the heritability.\nSome Monte-Carlo experiments are also conducted in order to show the finite\nsample performances of our estimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Apr 2014 16:14:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2015 13:23:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 06:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-07"}

Quite a few recent experimental and atomistic\nsimulation studies demonstrated that at low shear amplitudes, an amorphous\nsolid settles into an amplitude- and initial conditions-dependent dissipative\nlimit cycle, in which back-and-forth localized particle rearrangements\nperiodically bring the system to the same state. At sufficiently large shear\namplitudes, the amorphous system loses memory of the initial conditions,\nexhibits chaotic particle motions accompanied by diffusive behavior and settles\ninto a stochastic steady-state. The two regimes are separated by a transition\namplitude, possibly characterized by some critical-like features. Here we argue\nthat these observations support some of the physical assumptions embodied in\nthe nonequilibrium thermodynamic, internal-variables based,\nShear-Transformation-Zone model of amorphous visco-plasticity; most notably\nthat \"flow defects\" in amorphous solids are characterized by internal states\nbetween which they can make transitions, and that structural evolution is\ndriven by dissipation associated with plastic deformation. We present a rather\nextensive theoretical analysis of the thermodynamic Shear-Transformation-Zone\nmodel for a variable-amplitude oscillatory shear protocol, highlighting its\nsuccess in accounting for various experimental and simulational observations,\nas well as its limitations. Our results offer a continuum-level theoretical\nframework for interpreting the variable-amplitude oscillatory shear response of\namorphous solids and may promote additional developments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Apr 2014 16:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

This\ndissertation is concerned with the phenomenon known as superradiance, that is,\nwhen this coefficient is larger than unity.\n  We shall explore many examples of such systems, and, more importantly, we\nshall also see how, apart from the interest in its own right, superradiance is\nrelated to a number of important current research physical issues. We begin\nwith a small survey of important results on chapter one. On chapter two, we\nestablish a general criteria to decide whether or not superradiant scattering\nis observed based on the linear, second order, homogeneous ordinary\ndifferential equation (ODE) or linear, first order homogeneous systems of ODEs\nwhich describes the process and we shall give an example of system in which\nsuperradiance is observed. On chapter three, we focus on spinning black hole\nsuperradiance, we shall describe how one can compute explicitly the reflection\ncoefficient for different spin waves. Chapter four is dedicated to the\nrelations with thermodynamics. We develop what is meant by black hole\nthermodynamics, particularly the so-called first and second law of black hole\nthermodynamics, and apply them in the context of superradiance, so we can\ngeneralise some of the results from chapter three to more general black holes.\nFinally, on chapter five, we explore many of the quantum aspects of\nsuperradiance, including the relation with the Klein paradox, and the quantum\nversion of black hole superradiance, for the later we will explain briefly how\none usually quantise fields in curved space-time. A further connection with\nthermodynamics is explored.

In this model, nodes can\nstore only a limited number of resources while accessing the remaining ones\nthrough their closest neighbors. We consider this problem under both\noptimization and game-theoretic frameworks. In the case of optimal resource\nallocation we will first show that when there are only k=2 resources, the\noptimal allocation can be found efficiently in O(n^2\\log n) steps, where n\ndenotes the total number of nodes. However, for k>2 this problem becomes\nNP-hard with no polynomial time approximation algorithm with a performance\nguarantee better than 1+1/102k^2, even under metric access costs. We then\nprovide a 3-approximation algorithm for the optimal resource allocation which\nruns only in linear time O(n). Subsequently, we look at this problem under a\nselfish setting formulated as a noncooperative game and provide a\n3-approximation algorithm for obtaining its pure Nash equilibria under metric\naccess costs. We then establish an equivalence between the set of pure Nash\nequilibria and flip-optimal solutions of the Max-k-Cut problem over a specific\nweighted complete graph. Using this reduction, we show that finding the\nlexicographically smallest Nash equilibrium for k> 2 is NP-hard, and provide an\nalgorithm to find it in O(n^3 2^n) steps. While the reduction to weighted\nMax-k-Cut suggests that finding a pure Nash equilibrium using best response\ndynamics might be PLS-hard, it allows us to use tools from quadratic\nprogramming to devise more systematic algorithms towards obtaining Nash\nequilibrium points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 00:49:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 19:19:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 12:46:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Jun 2018 21:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 05:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2020 19:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

The proposed polynomial basis allows that $h$-point polynomial\nevaluation can be computed in $O(h\\log_2(h))$ finite field operations with\nsmall leading constant. As compared with the canonical polynomial basis, the\nproposed basis improves the arithmetic complexity of addition, multiplication,\nand the determination of polynomial degree from $O(h\\log_2(h)\\log_2\\log_2(h))$\nto $O(h\\log_2(h))$. Based on this basis, we then develop the encoding and\nerasure decoding algorithms for the $(n=2^r,k)$ Reed-Solomon codes. Thanks to\nthe efficiency of transform based on the polynomial basis, the encoding can be\ncompleted in $O(n\\log_2(k))$ finite field operations, and the erasure decoding\nin $O(n\\log_2(n))$ finite field operations. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first approach supporting Reed-Solomon erasure codes over\ncharacteristic-2 finite fields while achieving a complexity of $O(n\\log_2(n))$,\nin both additive and multiplicative complexities. As the complexity leading\nfactor is small, the algorithms are advantageous in practical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 04:23:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 15:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-25"}

A gradient in the PMF in a direction perpendicular to the\nfield direction leads to the Lorentz force on the charged species. Resultantly,\nan ambipolar diffusion occurs, and charged species can move differently from\nneutral species, which collapses gravitationally during the structure\nformation. We assume a gravitational contraction of neutral matter in a\nspherically symmetric structure, and calculate fluid motions of charged and\nneutral species. It is shown that the charged fluid, i.e., proton, electron and\n$^7$Li$^+$, can significantly decouple from the neutral fluid depending on the\nfield amplitude. The charged species can, therefore, escape from the\ngravitational collapse. We take the structure mass, the epoch of the\ngravitational collapse, and the comoving Lorenz force as parameters. We then\nidentify a parameter region for an effective chemical separation. This type of\nchemical separation can reduce the abundance ratio of Li/H in early structures\nbecause of inefficient contraction of $^7$Li$^+$ ion. Therefore, it may explain\nLi abundances of Galactic metal-poor stars which are smaller than the\nprediction in standard big bang nucleosynthesis model.

Spectral differential imaging (SDI) is part of the\nobserving strategy of current and future high-contrast imaging instruments. It\naims to reduce the stellar speckles that prevent the detection of cool planets\nby using in/out methane-band images. It attenuates the signature of off-axis\ncompanions to the star, such as angular differential imaging (ADI). However,\nthis attenuation depends on the spectral properties of the low-mass companions\nwe are searching for. The implications of this particularity on estimating the\ndetection limits have been poorly explored so far. Aims. We perform an imaging\nsurvey to search for cool (Teff<1000-1300 K) giant planets at separations as\nclose as 5-10 AU. We also aim to assess the sensitivity limits in SDI data\ntaking the photometric bias into account. This will lead to a better view of\nthe SDI performance. Methods. We observed a selected sample of 16 stars (age <\n200 Myr, d < 25 pc) with the phase-mask coronagraph, SDI, and ADI modes of\nVLT/NaCo. Results. We do not detect any companions. As for the sensitivity\nlimits, we argue that the SDI residual noise cannot be converted into mass\nlimits because it represents a differential flux, unlike the case of\nsingle-band images. This results in degeneracies for the mass limits, which may\nbe removed with the use of single-band constraints. We instead employ a method\nof directly determining the mass limits. The survey is sensitive to cool giant\nplanets beyond 10 AU for 65% and 30 AU for 100% of the sample. Conclusions. For\nclose-in separations, the optimal regime for SDI corresponds to SDI flux ratios\n>2. According to the BT-Settl model, this translates into Teff<800 K. The\nmethods described here can be applied to the data interpretation of SPHERE. We\nexpect better performance with the dual-band imager IRDIS, thanks to more\nsuitable filter characteristics and better image quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 09:17:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 16:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

Indeed, behavioral decisions can occur on fast\ntime scales (~100 ms), but it is unclear what neural circuit dynamics afford\nsampling at such high rates.\n  We analyzed a stochastic form of rate-based linear neuronal network dynamics\nwith synaptic weight matrix $W$, and the dependence on $W$ of the covariance of\nthe stationary distribution of joint firing rates. This covariance $\\Sigma$ can\nbe actively used to represent posterior uncertainty via sampling under a\nlinear-Gaussian latent variable model. The key insight is that the mapping\nbetween $W$ and $\\Sigma$ is degenerate: there are infinitely many $W$'s that\nlead to sampling from the same $\\Sigma$ but differ greatly in the speed at\nwhich they sample. We were able to explicitly separate these extra degrees of\nfreedom in a parametric form and thus study their effects on sampling speed.\n  We show that previous proposals for probabilistic sampling in neural circuits\ncorrespond to using a symmetric $W$ which violates Dale's law and results in\ncritically slow sampling, even for moderate stationary correlations. In\ncontrast, optimizing network dynamics for speed consistently yielded asymmetric\n$W$'s and dynamics characterized by fast transients, such that samples of\nnetwork activity became fully decorrelated over ~10 ms. Importantly, networks\nwith separate excitatory/inhibitory populations proved to be particularly\nefficient samplers, and were in the balanced regime.

Very recently the capability of nano-granular Pt(C)\nstructures to detect the presence of adsorbate water layers by conductance\nmodulations was demonstrated. For magnetic and strain sensing the underlying\nphysical mechanisms of the sensing effect have been analyzed in detail and are\nnow quite well understood.

Here we provide a theoretical framework that\nallows for a semi-quantitative understanding of the observed water-sensing\neffect.

The model can\naccount for the conductance modulation observed in the water adsorbate\nexperiments and can also be applied to understand similar effects caused by\nnear-interface dielectric anomalies of ferroelectric thin films on top of\nnano-granular Pt(C).

As\nan application, this face recovery approach is used for face verification.\nFacial features are learned from the recovered canonical-view face images by\nusing a facial component-based convolutional neural network.

(i) After excluding beaming effect and redshift\neffect, intrinsic $\\gamma$-ray luminosity with broad line luminosity, black\nhole mass and Eddington ratio have significant correlations. Our results\nconfirm the physical distinction between BL Lacs and FSRQs. (ii) The\ncorrelation between broad line luminosity and jet power is significant which\nsupports that jet power has a close link with accretion. Jet power depends on\nboth the Eddington ratio and black hole mass. We also obtain $LogL_{\\rm\nBLR}\\sim(0.98\\pm0.07)Log P_{\\rm jet}$ for all blazars, which is consistent with\nthe theoretical predicted coefficient. These results support that jets are\npowered by energy extraction from both accretion and black hole spin (i.e., not\nby accretion only). (iii) For almost all BL Lacs, $P_{\\rm jet}>L_{\\rm disk}$;\nfor most of FSRQs, $P_{\\rm jet}<L_{\\rm disk}$. The \"jet-dominance\"\n(parameterized as $\\frac{P_{\\rm jet}}{L_{\\rm disk}}$) is mainly controlled by\nthe bolometric luminosity. Finally, the radiative efficiency of $\\gamma$-ray\nand properties of TeV blazars detected by Fermi LAT were discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 12:41:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 18:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The physical parameters are the normalized latitudinal\nshear $a$ and the normalized field amplitude $b$. Only the solutions for the\nwavelengths with the maximal growth rates are considered. If these scales are\ncombined to the radial values of velocity, one finds that the (very small)\nradial velocity only depends slightly on $a$ and $b$, so that it can be used as\nthe free parameter of the eigenvalue system.\n  The resulting instability-generated tensors of magnetic diffusivity and eddy\nviscosity are highly anisotropic. The eddy diffusivity in latitudinal direction\nexceeds the eddy diffusivity in radial direction by orders of magnitude. Its\nlatitudinal profile shows a strong concentration toward the poles which is also\ntrue for the effective viscosity which has been calculated via the angular\nmomentum transport of the instability pattern. The resulting effective magnetic\nPrandtl number reaches values of $O(10^2)$, so that the differential rotation\ndecays much faster than the toroidal background field, which is {the} necessary\ncondition to explain the observed slow rotation of the early red-giant and\nsub-giant cores by means of magnetic instabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 12:59:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 13:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-25"}

[PNAS 106 (2009) 15160] have found that in several systems the\nlinear time dependence of the mean-square displacement (MSD) of diffusing\ncolloidal particles, typical of normal diffusion, is accompanied by a\nnon-Gaussian displacement distribution (DisD), with roughly exponential tails\nat short times, a situation they termed \"anomalous yet Brownian\" diffusion. The\ndiversity of systems in which this is observed calls for a generic model. We\npresent such a model where there is \"diffusivity memory\" but no \"direction\nmemory\" in the particle trajectory, and we show that it leads to both a linear\nMSD and a non-Gaussian DisD at short times. In our model, the diffusivity is\nundergoing a (perhaps biased) random walk, hence the expression \"diffusing\ndiffusivity\". The DisD is predicted to be exactly exponential at short times if\nthe distribution of diffusivities is itself exponential, but an exponential\nremains a good fit to the DisD for a variety of diffusivity distributions.\nMoreover, our generic model can be modified to produce subdiffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 13:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

To\nisolate its flux from any sky component, we fitted an analytical model of the\ncontinuum to observations performed in very faint mode with the detector in the\nstowed position shielded from the sky, and gathered over the eight year period\nstarting in 2001.

Objectives: To examine the effect of ELF-MFs on cancer cells.\nMethods: Five cancer cell lines were exposed to ELF-MFs within the range of\n0.025-5 microTesla, and the cells were examined for karyotype changes after 6\ndays. Results: All cancer cells lines lost chromosomes from MF exposure, with a\nmostly flat dose-response. Constant MF exposures for three weeks allow a rising\nreturn to the baseline, unperturbed karyotypes. From this point, small MF\nincreases or decreases are again capable of inducing karyotype contractions\n(KCs). Our data suggest that the KCs are caused by MF interference with\nmitochondria's adenosine triphosphate synthase (ATPS), compensated by the\naction of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The effects\nof MFs are similar to those of the ATPS inhibitor, oligomycin. They are\namplified by metformin, an AMPK stimulator, and attenuated by resistin, an AMPK\ninhibitor. Over environmental MFs, KCs of various cancer cell lines show\nexceptionally wide and flat dose-responses, except for those of erythroleukemia\ncells, which display a progressive rise from 0.025 to 0.4 microTesla.\nConclusions: The biological effects of MFs are connected to an alteration in\nthe structure of water that impedes the flux of protons in ATPS channels.

Although the origin of the anomaly is not clearly\nunderstood, suggested explanations include effect of cosmic-ray source\nspectrum, propagation effects, and the effect of nearby sources. In this paper,\nwe propose that the spectral anomaly might be an effect of re-acceleration of\ncosmic rays by weak shocks in the Galaxy. After acceleration by strong\nsupernova remnant shock waves, cosmic rays undergo diffusive propagation\nthrough the Galaxy. During the propagation, cosmic rays may again encounter\nexpanding supernova remnant shock waves, and get re-accelerated. As the\nprobability of encountering old supernova remnants is expected to be larger\nthan the younger ones due to their bigger sizes, re-acceleration is expected to\nbe mainly due to weaker shocks. Since weaker shocks generate a softer particle\nspectrum, the resulting re-accelerated component will have a spectrum steeper\nthan the initial cosmic-ray source spectrum produced by strong shocks. For a\nreasonable set of model parameters, it is shown that such re-accelerated\ncomponent can dominate the GeV energy region while the non-reaccelerated\ncomponent dominates at higher energies, explaining the observed GeV-TeV\nspectral anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 15:51:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Generally, the\nerror estimate shows how the accuracy is affected by the shell geometry and\nthickness.
