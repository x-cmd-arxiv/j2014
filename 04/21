Highly directional\ntransmissions are essential for cellular communication in these frequencies to\ncompensate for high isotropic path loss. This reliance on directional\nbeamforming, however, complicates initial cell search since the mobile and base\nstation must jointly search over a potentially large angular directional space\nto locate a suitable path to initiate communication. To address this problem,\nthis paper proposes a directional cell discovery procedure where base stations\nperiodically transmit synchronization signals, potentially in time-varying\nrandom directions, to scan the angular space. Detectors for these signals are\nderived based on a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) under various\nsignal and receiver assumptions. The detectors are then simulated under\nrealistic design parameters and channels based on actual experimental\nmeasurements at 28~GHz in New York City. The study reveals two key findings:\n(i) digital beamforming can significantly outperform analog beamforming even\nwhen the digital beamforming uses very low quantization to compensate for the\nadditional power requirements; and (ii) omni-directional transmissions of the\nsynchronization signals from the base station generally outperforms random\ndirectional scanning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Apr 2014 19:36:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 2014 15:57:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 23:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-23"}

Local value production implies that the cost of an\nenzyme must be balanced by a benefit, given by the economic potential\ndifference the catalysed reaction multiplied by the flux. Flux profiles that\nsatisfy this principle - i.e. for which consistent potentials can be found -\nare called economical. Economical fluxes must lead from lower to higher\neconomic potentials, so certain flux cycles are incompatible with any choice of\neconomic potentials and can be excluded. To obtain economical flux profiles,\nnon-beneficial local patterns, called futile motifs, can be systematically\nremoved from a given flux distribution. The principle of local value production\nresembles thermodynamic principles and complements them in models.

Both the analyses\nconsistently provide detail information on the dependence of immune response to\nthe variation of critical rate parameters. We find that although vitamin-D\nplays a negligible role in the initial immune response, it exerts a profound\ninfluence in the long term, especially in helping the system to achieve a new,\nstable steady state. The study explores the role of vitamin-D in preserving an\nobserved bistability in the phase diagram (spanned by system parameters) of\nimmune regulation, thus allowing the response to tolerate a wide range of\npathogenic stimulation which could help in resisting autoimmune diseases. We\nalso study how vitamin-D affects the time dependent population of dendritic\ncells that connect between innate and adaptive immune responses.

Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising\nframework to address it, due to its energy-efficient data compression\nprocedure. However, most CS algorithms have difficulty in data recovery due to\nnon-sparsity characteristic of many physiological signals. Block sparse\nBayesian learning (BSBL) is an effective approach to recover such signals with\nsatisfactory recovery quality.

Furthermore, its computational\nload is not significantly affected by the number of channels.

Results showed that the algorithm had both better\nrecovery performance and much higher speed than BSBL.

Considering fast quantum quenches within the same topological\nphase, leads, in some cases, to robust edge modes.

First, we have demonstrated that the\nEA training method converges faster and gives more accurate results than BP.\nThen we have made a full analysis of the effects of turning off different\ncombinations of neurons after the training phase.

In\naddition the two following results are used: (i) the available two-factor\n(capillarity and shrinkage) model of clay suction enables one to connect a clay\nsuction and clay water content using the clay matrix structure; and (ii) the\nrecent reference shrinkage curve model based on the concepts of intra-aggregate\nsoil structure permits one to connect the soil water content at shrinkage with\nthe water content of the contributive clay.

The underlying root formulas for\nGFPs and for weighted isobaric polynomials (WIPs), which appeared in an earlier\npaper by MacHenry and Tudose, make use of two types of operators. These\noperators are derived from the generating functions for Stirling numbers of the\nfirst kind and second kind. Hence we call them Stirling operators. To construct\nmatrix representations of the roots of GFPs, we use the Stirling operators of\nthe first kind. We give explicit examples to show how the Stirling operators of\nthe second kind appear in the low degree cases for the WIP-roots. As a\nconsequence of the matrix construction, we have matrix representations of\nmultiplicative arithmetic functions under the Dirichlet product into its\ndivisible closure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2014 15:38:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 May 2014 02:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 01:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-14"}
