An information theoretic approach is proposed, which\nexploits the channel as additional resources to achieve secret sharing\nrequirements. In this way, secret sharing problems can be reformulated as\nequivalent secure communication problems via wiretap channels, and can be\nsolved by employing powerful information theoretic security techniques. This\napproach is first developed for the classic secret sharing problem, in which\nonly one secret is to be shared. This classic problem is shown to be equivalent\nto a communication problem over a compound wiretap channel. The lower and upper\nbounds on the secrecy capacity of the compound channel provide the\ncorresponding bounds on the secret sharing rate. The power of the approach is\nfurther demonstrated by a more general layered multi-secret sharing problem,\nwhich is shown to be equivalent to the degraded broadcast multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) channel with layered decoding and secrecy constraints.\nThe secrecy capacity region for the degraded MIMO broadcast channel is\ncharacterized, which provides the secret sharing capacity region. Furthermore,\nthese secure encoding schemes that achieve the secrecy capacity region provide\nan information theoretic scheme for sharing the secrets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 16:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-28"}

We show that any such semigroup is isomorphic to\na `$W$-product' $W(T,Y)$, where $T$ is a monoid, $Y$ is a semilattice and there\nis a homomorphism from $T$ into the inverse semigroup $TI_Y$ of isomorphisms\nbetween ideals of $Y$. Conversely, all such $W$-products are almost perfect.\nSince we also show that every restriction semigroup has an easily computed\ncover of this type, the combination yields a `McAlister-type' theorem for all\nrestriction semigroups. It is one of the theses of this work that almost\nperfection and perfection, the analogue of this definition for restriction\nmonoids, are the appropriate settings for such a theorem. That these theorems\ndo not reduce to a general theorem for inverse semigroups illustrates a second\nthesis of this work: that restriction (and, by extension, Ehresmann) semigroups\nhave a rich theory that does not consist merely of generalizations of inverse\nsemigroup theory.

Therefore, conformity manifestly\nviolates the widely adopted assumption that the dark matter halo mass Mvir\nexclusively governs galaxy occupation statistics. This paper is the first in a\nseries studying the implications of the observed conformity signal for the\ngalaxy-dark matter connection. We show that recent measurements of conformity\non scales R ~1-5 Mpc imply that central galaxy quenching statistics cannot be\ncorrectly predicted with the knowledge of Mvir alone.

We present several arguments that the gas at these velocities\nobserved in these directions originates from the CGM of M31 rather than the\nLocal Group or Milky Way CGM or Magellanic Stream. We show that the dwarf\ngalaxies located in the CGM of M31 have very similar velocities over similar\nprojected distances from M31. We find a non-trivial relationship only at these\nvelocities between the column densities (N) of all the ions and R, whereby N\ndecreases with increasing R. Singly ionized species are only detected in the\ninner CGM of M31 at R<0.2Rvir. At R<0.8 Rvir, the covering fraction is close to\nunity for SiIII and CIV (fc~60%-97% at the 90% confidence level), but drops to\nfc<10-20% at R>Rvir. We show that the M31 CGM gas is bound, multiphase,\npredominantly ionized (i.e., HII>>HI), and becomes more highly ionized gas at\nlarger R. We estimate using SiII, SiIII, and SiIV a CGM metal mass of at least\n2x10^6 Msun and gas mass of >3x10^9(Zsun/Z) Msun within 0.2 Rvir, and possibly\na factor ~10 larger within Rvir, implying substantial metal and gas masses in\nthe CGM of M31.

This orbital density growth along with the wider\nbeamwidth of a smaller dish have imposed an overloaded scenario at the\nsatellite receiver, where the number of transmitting satellites exceeds the\nnumber of receiving elements at the dish antenna. To ensure successful\noperation in this practical scenario, we propose a satellite receiver that\nenhances signal detection from the desired satellite by mitigating the\ninterference from neighboring satellites. Towards this objective, we propose a\nreduced complexity list-based group-wise search detection (RC-LGSD) receiver\nunder the assumption of spatially correlated additive noise. To further enhance\ndetection performance, the proposed satellite receiver utilizes a newly\ndesigned whitening filter to remove the spatial correlation amongst the noise\nparameters, while also applying a preprocessor that maximizes the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Extensive simulations under\npractical scenarios show that the proposed receiver enhances the performance of\nsatellite broadcast systems in the presence of ASI compared to existing\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 20:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-29"}

In futures markets these contracts can be traded with\nvarying expiration dates and underlyings. A common hedging strategy is to roll\npositions forward into the next expiration date, however this strategy comes\nwith significant operational risk. To address this risk, exchanges started to\noffer so-called futures contract combinations, which allow the traders for\nswapping two futures contracts with different expiration dates or for swapping\ntwo futures contracts with different underlyings. In theory, the price is in\nboth cases the difference of the two involved futures contracts.

We show that (i) Br vacancies are the\nprimary electron traps during the initial stage of thermalization of hot\ncarriers, prior to hole capture by Ce dopants; (ii) isolated Br vacancies are\nassociated with deep levels; (iii) Sr doping increases the Br vacancy\nconcentration by several orders of magnitude; (iv) $\\text{Sr}_\\text{La}$ binds\nto $V_\\text{Br}$ resulting in a stable neutral complex; and (v) association\nwith Sr causes the deep vacancy level to move toward the conduction band edge.\nThe latter is essential for reducing the effective carrier density available\nfor Auger quenching during thermalization of hot carriers. Subsequent\nde-trapping of electrons from $\\text{Sr}_\\text{La}-V_\\text{La}$ complexes then\ncan activate Ce dopants that have previously captured a hole leading to\nluminescence.

The small effect of this\nfurther excitation on the neutron capture and gamma decay sequence relevant for\nnucleosynthesis is quantified and compared to the corresponding effect of an\nadditional low-energy photoexcitation step.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 21:17:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 13:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-28"}

It has been recently established\nthat joint design of content delivery and storage (coded caching) can\nsignificantly improve performance over conventional caching. Coded caching is\nwell suited to emerging heterogeneous wireless architectures which consist of a\ndense deployment of local-coverage wireless access points (APs) with high data\nrates, along with sparsely-distributed, large-coverage macro-cell base stations\n(BS). This enables design of coded caching-and-delivery schemes that equip APs\nwith storage, and place content in them in a way that creates coded-multicast\nopportunities for combining with macro-cell broadcast to satisfy users even\nwith different demands. Such coded-caching schemes have been shown to be\norder-optimal with respect to the BS transmission rate, for a system with\nsingle-level content, i.e., one where all content is uniformly popular. In this\nwork, we consider a system with non-uniform popularity content which is divided\ninto multiple levels, based on varying degrees of popularity. The main\ncontribution of this work is the derivation of an order-optimal scheme which\njudiciously shares cache memory among files with different popularities. To\nshow order-optimality we derive new information-theoretic lower bounds, which\nuse a sliding-window entropy inequality, effectively creating a non-cutset\nbound. We also extend the ideas to when users can access multiple caches along\nwith the broadcast. Finally we consider two extreme cases of user distribution\nacross caches for the multi-level popularity model: a single user per cache\n(single-user setup) versus a large number of users per cache (multi-user\nsetup), and demonstrate a dichotomy in the order-optimal strategies for these\ntwo extreme cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 21:32:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2015 20:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-01"}

Both of them were white-light (WL) flares, as\ncaptured by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar\nDynamics Observatory in visible continuum at 617.3 nm which is believed to\noriginate from the deep solar atmosphere.We investigate the WL emission of\nthese X-class flares with HMIs seeing-free imaging spectroscopy. The durations\nof impulsive peaks in the continuum are about 4 minutes. We compare the WL with\nhard X-ray (HXR) observations for the September 6 flare and find a good\ncorrelation between the continuum and HXR both spatially and temporally. In\nabsence of RHESSI data during the second flare on September 7, the derivative\nof the GOES soft X-ray is used and also found to be well correlated temporally\nwith the continuum. We measure the contrast enhancements, characteristic sizes,\nand HXR fluxes of the twin flares, which are similar for both flares,\nindicating analogous triggering and heating processes. However, the September 7\nflare was associated with conspicuous sunquake signals whereas no seismic wave\nwas detected during the flare on September 6. Therefore, this comparison\nsuggests that the particle bombardment may not play a dominant role in\nproducing the sunquake events studied in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 22:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The central limit theorems (CLT's) for linear spectral statistics of\nhigh-dimensional non-centered sample covariance matrices have received\nconsiderable attention in random matrix theory and have been applied to many\nhigh-dimensional statistical problems. However, known population mean vectors\nare assumed for non-centered sample covariance matrices, some of which even\nassume Gaussian-like moment conditions. In fact, there are still another two\nmost frequently used sample covariance matrices: the MLE (by subtracting the\nsample mean vector from each sample vector) and the unbiased sample covariance\nmatrix (by changing the denominator $n$ as $N=n-1$ in the MLE) without\ndepending on unknown population mean vectors.

We construct a modified version of the model\nwhere viscosity varies with time, in such a way that energy is conserved, and\nthe resulting dynamics is fully time-reversible. For each value of the forcing,\nthe statistical properties of the irreversible and reversible model are in\nexcellent agreement, if in the latter the energy is kept constant at a value\nequal to the time-average realized with the irreversible model. In particular,\nthe average contraction rate of the phase space of the time-reversible model\nagrees with that of the irreversible model, where instead it is constant by\nconstruction. We also show that the phase space contraction rate obeys the\nfluctuation relation, and we relate its finite time corrections to the\ncharacteristic time scales of the system. A local version of the fluctuation\nrelation is explored and successfully checked. The equivalence between the two\nnon-equilibrium ensembles extends to dynamical properties such as the Lyapunov\nexponents, which are shown to obey to a good degree of approximation a pairing\nrule.

This suggests a\nsynthesised radioactive $^{56}$Ni mass of $\\sim 0.4 M_\\odot$.\nGRB130427A/SN2013cq is the first case of low-z GRB-SN connection where the GRB\nenergetics are extreme ($E_{\\rm \\gamma, iso} \\sim 10^{54}$ erg). We show that\nthe maximum luminosities attained by SNe associated with GRBs span a very\nnarrow range, but those associated with XRFs are significantly less luminous.\nOn the other hand the isotropic energies of the accompanying GRBs span 6 orders\nof magnitude (10$^{48}$ erg $< E_{\\rm \\gamma, iso} <$ 10$^{54}$ erg), although\nthis range is reduced when corrected for jet collimation. The GRB total\nradiated energy is in fact a small fraction of the SN energy budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Apr 2014 15:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

It is found\nthat the cone angle is independent of substrate temperature and wetting angle,\nsuggesting a universal, self-similar mechanism that does not depend on the rate\nof solidification.

The grains at the\nlocation of crack initiation are investigated using electron backscatter\ndiffraction (EBSD) measurements with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This\nresults in determination of maximal Schmid factors for the slip system that\nlead to the initiation of the LCF surface crack. It is shown using stress -\nlife and strain - life models, that taking into account the Schmid factor\nconsiderable reduces the scatter in LCF life prediction. This is used to\npropose a probabilistic model for LCF life based on random grain orientations.\nUsing Mote Carlo simulation, we determine the probability distribution for the\nmaximal Schmid factor in an uniaxial stress state under isotropic random\norientations of the grain. This is used to calculate failure probabilities\nunder the above mentioned model and to compare them with experimental data.\nBased on extreme value statistics, it is discussed whether a high maximal\nSchmid factor can be considered as causally related to an early initiation of\nan LCF crack and we present some rather surprising experimental evidence.
