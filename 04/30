We made efforts to\nresolve the distance ambiguity by careful comparison with the radio continuum\nand HI 21 cm observations.\n  Results: First, the maser sources show increased ^{13}CO line widths toward\nthe Galactic center, suggesting that the molecular gas are more turbulent\ntoward the Galactic center. This trend can be noticeably traced by the ^{13}CO\nline width. Second, the ^{12}CO excitation temperature shows a noticeable\ncorrelation with the H_2 column density. A possible explanation consistent with\nthe collapse model is that the higher surface-density gas is more efficient to\nthe stellar heating and/or has a higher formation rate of high-mass stars.\nThird, comparing the IRDCs, the maser sources on average have significantly\nlower H_2 column densities, moderately higher temperatures, and similar line\nwidths. Fourth, in the mapped regions, 51 ^{13}CO cores have been revealed.\nOnly 17 coincide with the radio continuum emission (F_{cm}>6 mJy), while a\nlarger fraction (30 cores) coincide with the infrared emissions. The IR-bright\nand radio-bright sources exhibit significantly higher $^{12}$CO excitation\ntemperatures than the IR-faint and radio-faint sources, respectively.\n  Conclusions: The 6.7 GHz masers show a moderately low ionization rate but\nhave a common-existing stellar heating that generates the IR emissions.

Much of the technology is common to both applications. E-sail technology\ndevelopment was carried out in ESAIL FP7 project (2011-2013) which achieved TRL\n4-5 for key hardware components that can enable 1 N class interplanetary E-sail\nweighing less than 200 kg. The thrust of the E-sail scales as inverse solar\ndistance and its power consumption (nominally 700 W/N at 1 au) scales as the\ninverse distance squared. As part of the ESAIL project, a continuous 1 km\nsample of E-sail tether was produced by an automatic and scalable \"tether\nfactory\". The manufacturing method uses ultrasonic wire to wire bonding which\nwas developed from ordinary wire to plate bonding for the E-sail purpose.

Simultaneous ($\\sim$ millisecond) exposures by the\nscience camera and the AO system enable the use of \"phase diversity\" to\nestimate both the NCPAs and the scene via a processing procedure first\ndescribed by the author (R. Frazin 2013, ApJ, 767, article id. 21). This method\nis fully compatible with more standard concepts used in long-exposure\nhigh-contrast imaging, such as angular differential imaging and spectral\ndeconvolution. Long-exposure methods find time-dependent NCPAs, such as those\ncaused by vibrations, particularly challenging. Here, an NCPA of the form of\n$\\alpha \\cos(k \\cdot r - \\omega t + \\vartheta)$ is considered. It is shown\nthat, when sampled at millisecond time-scales, the image plane data are\nsensitive to $\\mbox{arg}(\\alpha)$, $\\vartheta$ and $\\omega$, and, therefore\nsuch NCPAs can be simultaneously estimated with the scene. Simulations of\nobservations with ms exposure times are reported. These simulations include\nsubstantial detector noise and a sinusoidal NCPA that places a speckle exactly\nat the location of a planet. Simulations show that the effects of detector\nnoise can be mitigated by mixing exposures of various lengths, allowing\nestimation of the planet's brightness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 18:28:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 20:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The results show that even for a business-as-usual\n(the mid-level IPCC) fossil fuel use estimate, global surface temperature will\nrise at a slower rate than for the recent period 1960-2000. Concerning peak\nfossil fuel, for the most common scenario the currently observed\n(1998-2013)temperature plateau will turn into a decrease. The observed trend to\ndate for temperature is compared with that for global climate disasters: these\npeaked in 2005 and are notably decreasing. The temperature and disaster results\ntaken together are consistent with either a reduced business-as-usual fossil\nfuel use scenario into the future, or a peak fossil fuel scenario, but not with\nthe standard business-as-usual scenario. If the future follows a peak fossil\nfuel pathway, a markedly decreasing trend in global surface temperature should\nbecome apparent over the next few years. If entertained, these results are\nevidence that the climate problem may require less preventative action. If so,\nthe same evidence is support for the case that the peak fossil fuel problem\ndoes require preventative action. This action is the same as it would have been\nfor climate - the rapid transition to a predominantly renewable global energy\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 19:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-30"}

In this paper, we determine the entire s.d.o.f. regions of these\ntwo channel models. The converse for the MAC follows from a middle step in the\nconverse of [1,2]. The converse for the IC includes constraints both due to\nsecrecy as well as due to interference. Although the portion of the region\nclose to the optimum sum s.d.o.f. point is governed by the upper bounds due to\nsecrecy constraints, the other portions of the region are governed by the upper\nbounds due to interference constraints. Different from the existing literature,\nin order to fully understand the characterization of the s.d.o.f. region of the\nIC, one has to study the 4-user case, i.e., the 2 or 3-user cases do not\nillustrate the generality of the problem. In order to prove the achievability,\nwe use the polytope structure of the converse region. In both MAC and IC cases,\nwe develop explicit schemes that achieve the extreme points of the polytope\nregion given by the converse. Specifically, the extreme points of the MAC\nregion are achieved by an m-user MAC wiretap channel with (K-m) helpers, i.e.,\nby setting (K-m) users' secure rates to zero and utilizing them as pure\n(structured) cooperative jammers. The extreme points of the IC region are\nachieved by a (K-m)-user IC with confidential messages, m helpers, and N\nexternal eavesdroppers, for m>=1 and a finite N. A byproduct of our results in\nthis paper is that the sum s.d.o.f. is achieved only at one extreme point of\nthe s.d.o.f. region, which is the symmetric-rate extreme point, for both MAC\nand IC channel models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 19:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

In contrast, models that are either based on both\ncentral and angular potentials (type one) or on binding agents (type two)\nefficiently prevent restructuring of the agglomerates, and are therefore useful\nfor modeling contacts formed by plastic deformation. Moreover, both types of\nmodels allow to control the rigidity and by that the degree of restructuring.\nThe first type of model is computationally more efficient at low fractional\ndimensions of the aggregates, while the second gives easy access to local shear\nforces, which is important when breaking of agglomerates is to be considered.\nAs example applications, we reproduce the well-known diffusion-limited\nagglomeration (DLA) and report results on soot aggregation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 19:51:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 11:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-01"}

Finally, we use simple estimates of the detection limits for a\nfiducial RV survey to predict the number and properties of analogs of the\nmicrolensing planet population such an RV survey should detect.

On average the\nfraction of galaxies that reside in subhaloes is a function of host halo mass,\nwhere more massive systems have a higher fraction of subhalo galaxies both in\nthe overall galaxy and infall populations. Additionally, we find that between 2\n< r_200 < 3 the quiescent fraction is higher in the subhalo population with\nrespect to both the field and non-subhalo populations. At these large radii (2\n< r_200 < 3), the majority of galaxies (~ 80 %) belong to the infall population\nand therefore, we attribute the enhanced quenching to infalling subhalo\ngalaxies, indicating that pre-processing has occurred in the subhalo\npopulation.

At stellar masses higher than the\ncharacteristic turnover mass, the mass-metallicity relation flattens as\nmetallicities begin to saturate. We show that the redshift evolution of the\nmass-metallicity relation depends only on evolution of the characteristic\nturnover mass. The relationship between metallicity and the stellar mass\nnormalized to the characteristic turnover mass is independent of redshift. We\nfind that the redshift independent slope of the mass-metallicity relation is\nset by the slope of the relationship between gas mass and stellar mass. The\nturnover in the mass-metallicity relation occurs when the gas-phase oxygen\nabundance is high enough that the amount of oxygen locked up in low mass stars\nis an appreciable fraction of the amount of oxygen produced by massive stars.\nThe characteristic turnover mass is the stellar mass where the stellar-to-gas\nmass ratio is unity. Numerical modeling suggests that the relationship between\nmetallicity and stellar-to-gas mass ratio is a redshift independent, universal\nrelationship followed by all galaxies as they evolve. The mass-metallicity\nrelation originates from this more fundamental universal relationship between\nmetallicity and stellar-to-gas mass ratio.

While experimental\ndemonstrations of the appearance of Fano resonances have been made in both\nplasmonic and photonic-crystal structures, the control of these resonances is\nexperimentally challenging, often involving the coupling of near-resonant\ncavities.

Estimation of these graphs\ndepends on two steps. First is a feature extraction by summarizing measurements\nwithin a parcellation, regional or set definition to create nodes. Secondly,\nthese summaries are then used to create a graph representing relationships of\ninterest. In this manuscript we study the impact of dimension reduction on\ngraphs that describe different notions of relations among a set of random\nvariables. We are particularly interested in undirected graphs that capture the\nrandom variables' independence and conditional independence relations. A\ndimension reduction procedure can be any mapping from high dimensional spaces\nto low dimensional spaces. We exploit a general framework for modeling the raw\ndata and advocate that in estimating the undirected graphs, any acceptable\ndimension reduction procedure should be a graph-homotopic mapping, i.e., the\ngraphical structure of the data after dimension reduction should inherit the\nmain characteristics of the graphical structure of the raw data. We show that,\nin terms of inferring undirected graphs that characterize the conditional\nindependence relations among random variables, many dimension reduction\nprocedures, such as the mean, median, or principal components, cannot be\ntheoretically guaranteed to be a graph-homotopic mapping. The implications of\nthis work are broad. In the most charitable setting for researchers, where the\ncorrect node definition is known, graphical relationships can be contaminated\nmerely via the dimension reduction.

Early-stage\nwaves mediated by acetylcholine (ACh) manifest as slow, spreading bursts of\naction potentials. They are believed to be initiated by the spontaneous firing\nof Starburst Amacrine Cells (SACs), whose dense, recurrent connectivity then\npropagates this activity laterally. Their extended inter-wave intervals and\nshifting wave boundaries are the result of the slow after-hyperpolarization of\nthe SACs creating an evolving mosaic of recruitable and refractory cells, which\ncan and cannot participate in waves, respectively. Recent evidence suggests\nthat cholinergic waves may be modulated by the extracellular concentration of\nACh. Here, we construct a simplified, biophysically consistent,\nreaction-diffusion model of cholinergic retinal waves capable of recapitulating\nwave dynamics observed in mice retina recordings. The dense, recurrent\nconnectivity of SACs is modeled through local, excitatory coupling occurring\nvia the volume release and diffusion of ACh.

Assessing\nthe validity of such extrapolative predictions, which is critical to informed\ndecision-making, is challenging. In classical approaches to validation, model\noutputs for observed quantities are compared to observations to determine if\nthey are consistent. By itself, this consistency only ensures that the model\ncan predict the observed quantities under the conditions of the observations.\nThis limitation dramatically reduces the utility of the validation effort for\ndecision making because it implies nothing about predictions of unobserved QoIs\nor for scenarios outside of the range of observations.

While synchrotron radiation is thought to be spectrally smooth and\ndescribed by relatively few degrees of freedom, the instrumental response to\nbright foregrounds may be much more complex. To deal with such complexities, we\ndevelop an approach that discovers contaminated spectral modes using spatial\nfluctuations of the measured data. This approach exploits the fact that\nforegrounds vary across the sky while the signal does not. The discovered modes\nare projected out of each line-of-sight of a data cube.

The problem requires more care and attention when data\ncomes from multiple distributed sites, each receiving a stream of data. This\npaper considers the problem of \"tracking approximations to a matrix\" in the\ndistributed streaming model. In this model, there are m distributed sites each\nobserving a distinct stream of data (where each element is a row of a\ndistributed matrix) and has a communication channel with a coordinator, and the\ngoal is to track an eps-approximation to the norm of the matrix along any\ndirection.

We construct the\nfiducial model so that it reproduces the observationally estimated galaxy\nstellar mass functions and the relationships between the galaxy stellar mass\nand the host halo mass from $z = 4$ to 0. We find that the fiducial model\nconstructed this way naturally explains the cosmic star formation history, the\ngalaxy downsizing, and the star formation rate and metallicity of the\nstar-forming galaxies. The simulations without the quenching of the gas cooling\nin large halos overproduce massive galaxies at $z < 2$ and fail to reproduce\ngalaxy downsizing. The simulations that do not employ the radiation pressure\nfeedback from young stars predict too strong redshift evolution of the\nmass-metallicity relation. Furthermore, the slope of the relation becomes too\nsteep at low redshift without the radiation pressure feedback. The metallicity\ndependence in the radiation pressure feedback is a key to explain the observed\nmass-metallicity relation. These facts indicate that these two processes in\naddition to supernova feedback are essential for galaxy evolution. Our simple\nphenomenological model is suitable to construct a mock galaxy sample to study\nphysical properties of observed galaxy populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 02:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-15"}

Verw. Gebiete 64(3)]. We consider extensions of this result to non\nGaussian infinitely divisible processes. First we show that the class of\ninfinitely divisible semimartingales is so large that the natural analog of\nStricker's theorem fails to hold. Then, as the main result, we prove that an\ninfinitely divisible semimartingale relative to the filtration generated by a\nrandom measure admits a unique decomposition into an independent increment\nprocess and an infinitely divisible process of finite variation. Consequently,\nthe natural analog of Stricker's theorem holds for all strictly representable\nprocesses (as defined in this paper). Since Gaussian processes are strictly\nrepresentable due to Hida's multiplicity theorem, the classical Stricker's\ntheorem follows from our result. Another consequence is that the question when\nan infinitely divisible process is a semimartingale can often be reduced to a\npath property, when a certain associated infinitely divisible process is of\nfinite variation. This gives the key to characterize the semimartingale\nproperty for many processes of interest. Along these lines, we characterize\nsemimartingales within a large class of stationary increment infinitely\ndivisible processes; this class includes many infinitely divisible processes,\nincluding linear fractional processes, mixed moving averages, and supOU\nprocesses, as particular cases. The proof of the main theorem relies on series\nrepresentations of jumps of cadlag infinitely divisible processes given in\nBasse-O'Connor and Rosinski [2013, Ann.

Consequently, the observation of bulk\nCDW order in YBCO was a significant development [5,6,7]. Hg1201 features\nparticularly high structural symmetry and recently has been demonstrated to\nexhibit Fermi-liquid charge transport in the relevant temperature-doping range\nof the phase diagram, whereas for YBCO and other cuprates this underlying\nproperty of the CuO$_2$ planes is partially or fully masked [8-10]. It\ntherefore is imperative to establish if the pristine transport behavior of\nHg1201 is compatible with CDW order. Here we investigate Hg1201 ($T_c$ = 72 K)\nvia bulk Cu L-edge resonant X-ray scattering. We indeed observe CDW\ncorrelations in the absence of a magnetic field, although the correlations and\ncompetition with superconductivity are weaker than in YBCO. Interestingly, at\nthe measured hole-doping level, both the short-range CDW and Fermi-liquid\ntransport appear below the same temperature of about 200 K. Our result points\nto a unifying picture in which the CDW formation is preceded at the higher\npseudogap temperature by $q$ = 0 magnetic order [11,12] and the build-up of\nsignificant dynamic antiferromagnetic correlations [13]. Furthermore, the\nsmaller CDW modulation wave vector observed for Hg1201 is consistent with the\nlarger electron pocket implied by both QO [4] and Hall-effect [14]\nmeasurements, which suggests that CDW correlations are indeed responsible for\nthe low-temperature QO phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 09:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-05"}

We first present and analyze a protocol with 4 states\nper vertex that always computes the initial majority value, under any fair\nscheduler. As we prove, this protocol is optimal, in the sense that there is no\npopulation protocol that always computes majority with fewer than 4 states per\nvertex. However this does not rule out the existence of a protocol with 3\nstates per vertex that is correct with high probability. To this end, we\nexamine a very natural majority protocol with 3 states per vertex, introduced\nin [Angluin et al. 2008] where its performance has been analyzed for the clique\ngraph. We study the performance of this protocol in arbitrary networks. We\nprove that, when the two initial states are put uniformly at random on the\nvertices, this protocol converges to the initial majority with probability\nhigher than the probability of converging to the initial minority.

However, this requires large values of Higgs-portal\ncouplings or a large number N of singlets.

The measured enhancement\nfactor of the PA signal exceeds 1200, which is due to the acoustic resonance of\nthe tube and the absorption enhancement of the integrating sphere relatively to\na non-resonant single pass cell. It is observed that the background absorption\nsignals are highly attenuated due to the thermal conduction and diffusion\neffects in the polytetrafluoroethylene cell walls.

We derived\nreddening, distance, age and metallicity of the clusters from extracted\n$(C-T_1,T_1)$ color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), using theoretical isochrones\ncomputed for the Washington system. There are no previous photometric data in\nthe optical band for BH 84, NGC 5381 and BH 211. The CMDs of the observed\nclusters show relatively well defined main sequences, except for Czernik 37,\nwherein significant differential reddening seems to be present. The red giant\nclump is clearly seen only in BH 211. For this cluster, we estimated the age in\n(1000$^{+260}_{-200}$) Myr, assuming a metallicity of $Z$ = 0.019. BH 84 was\nfound to be much older than it was previously believed, while NGC 5381 happened\nto be much younger than previously reported. The heliocentric distances to\nthese clusters are found to range between 1.4 and 3.4 kpc. BH 84 appears to be\nlocated at the solar galactocentric distance, while NGC 5381, BH 211 and\nCzernik 37 are situated inside the solar ring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

A bow-tie in a multi-layered structure\noccurs when intermediate layers have much fewer components than the input and\noutput layers. Examples include metabolism where a handful of building blocks\nmediate between multiple input nutrients and multiple output biomass\ncomponents, and signaling networks where information from numerous receptor\ntypes passes through a small set of signaling pathways to regulate multiple\noutput genes. Little is known, however, about how bow-tie architectures evolve.\nHere, we address the evolution of bow-tie architectures using simulations of\nmulti-layered systems evolving to fulfill a given input-output goal. We find\nthat bow-ties spontaneously evolve when two conditions are met: (i) the\nevolutionary goal is rank deficient, where the rank corresponds to the minimal\nnumber of input features on which the outputs depend, and (ii) The effects of\nmutations on interaction intensities between components are described by\nproduct rule - namely the mutated element is multiplied by a random number.\nProduct-rule mutations are more biologically realistic than the commonly used\nsum-rule mutations that add a random number to the mutated element. These\nconditions robustly lead to bow-tie structures. The minimal width of the\nintermediate network layers (the waist or knot of the bow-tie) equals the rank\nof the evolutionary goal. These findings can help explain the presence of\nbow-ties in diverse biological systems, and can also be relevant for machine\nlearning applications that employ multi-layered networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 13:11:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-26"}

We also make an attempt to apply our\nlinear wave analysis to explain some numerical features associated with the\nequatorial jet development seen in the GCM by Showman & Polvani (2011). During\nthe spin-up phase of the equatorial jet, the acceleration of the jet as a\nresult of the divergence of the wave momentum flux can be in principle boosted\nby the Rossby-wave resonance as the superrotating jet speed is close to the\nphase speed of the Rossby waves. However, we also find that as the jet speed\nincreases, the Rossby-wave structure shifts eastward, while the Kelvin-wave\nstructure remains approximately stationary, leading to the decline of the\nacceleration rate. Our analytic model of jet evolution implies that there\nexists only one stable equilibrium state of the atmosphere, possibly implying\nthat the final state of the atmosphere is independent of initial conditions in\nthe linear regime. Limitations and future improvements are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 08:58:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 15:37:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Its interpretation as a Brout-Englert-Higgs boson is very\nplausible and appealing to complete the zoology of fundamental particles in the\nStandard Model. The interplay between theorists and experimentalists that we\nhave witnessed has come with a huge work to determine with enough precision the\nparameters of the Standard Model: couplings, masses, mixing angles. Among the\nvarious tools developed by physicists, lattice QCD is particularly suitable to\nknow those parameters in the quark sector. In this report I discuss the lattice\nmeasurement of Standard Model fundamental parameters that are closely related\nto Higgs boson: its main production mode is the gluon-gluon fusion, whose the\nmagnitude is governed by the strong coupling constant, while its most favored\ndecay channel, $H \\to b \\bar{b}$, has a coupling proportional to the $b$ quark\nmass. I outline the improvements brought by the lattice community: simulations\nwith $N_f=2+1+1$ dynamical quarks are crucial to study how much the charm quark\nimpacts the strong coupling constant calculation. A non perturbative matching\nbetween Heavy Quark Effective Theory and QCD is welcome to handle in an\nappropriate way the $b$ quark physics. An extensive methodological exploration\nis necessary to get rid of contribution from excited states in correlation\nfunctions computed to extract hadron masses and decay constants. The effort to\nmeasure the $u/d$, $s$ and $c$ quark masses is also discussed, illustrating the\nbenefit of using an automatic $O(a)$ improved lattice regularization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 14:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-02"}

Due to the\nnon-locality of the fractional Laplacian, it is challenging to find the\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the fractional Schrodinger equation either\nanalytically or numerically. We first introduce a fractional gradient flow with\ndiscrete normalization and then discretize it by using the trapezoidal type\nquadrature rule in space and the semi-implicit Euler method in time. Our method\ncan be used to compute the ground and first excited states not only in the\nlinear cases but also in the nonlinear cases. Moreover, it can be generalized\nto solve the fractional partial differential equations (PDEs) with Riesz\nfractional derivatives in space. Our numerical results suggest that the\neigenfunctions of the fractional Schrodinger equation in an infinite potential\nwell are significantly different from those of the standard (non-fractional)\nSchrodinger equation. In addition, we find that the strong nonlocal\ninteractions represented by the fractional Laplacian can lead to a large\nscattering of particles inside of the potential well. Compared to the ground\nstates, the scattering of particles in the first excited states is larger.\nFurthermore, boundary layers emerge in the ground states and additionally inner\nlayers exist in the first excited states of the fractional nonlinear\nSchrodinger equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 00:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-05"}

If\nrenormalizable fields are assumed, then results are obtained only in the case\nof a at space. Therefore, there is still no generally recognized quantum theory\nof gravitation and electromagnetism. In this work the solution of these quantum\nmechanic problems are forced in some sense: the metric tensor is linearized,\nand it is required that the entire system of equations is invariant with\nrespect to the symmetry group of the linearized Einstein equations. The field\nwhich represents this symmetry group only allows a measurement within the\nhorizon to simulate the event horizon. It is shown that the number of quants of\nthis field is constant. There are 4 types of solutions in the 2-quantum space,\nof which one has particle-like properties. This particular solution has a\ngravitational effect which can be externally arbitrarily small, as compared to\nits electromagnetic effect. In contrast, this does not apply to the other 3\nsolutions. The model might be used to explain why gravitation is so much weaker\nthan the electromagnetic interaction in real physics. Accordingly, the Higgs\nboson is possibly not necessarily be required for the mass scale. Likewise, an\nexplanation could be made why gravitation and electromagnetic inter- actions\nhad the same intensity during the early stages of the universe. A peculiarity\nof the model provides a mechanism for the Big Bang in all four types of\nsolutions, although there is no singularity. As a consequence of the inferred\nchange in the microstructure, a change in the macrostructure of the cosmos is\nsuggested, allowing an understanding of the particular properties of the Dark\nMatter and the accelerated expansion of the cosmos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 22:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-25"}
