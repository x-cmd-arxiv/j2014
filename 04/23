This\nencompasses as special cases several known penalties such as the Lasso\n($\\ell^1$-norm), the group Lasso ($\\ell^1-\\ell^2$-norm), the\n$\\ell^\\infty$-norm, and the nuclear norm. This also includes so-called\nanalysis-type priors, i.e. composition of the previously mentioned penalties\nwith linear operators, typical examples being the total variation or fused\nLasso penalties.We study the sensitivity of any regularized minimizer to\nperturbations of the observations and provide its precise local\nparameterization.Our main sensitivity analysis result shows that the predictor\nmoves locally stably along the same active submanifold as the observations\nundergo small perturbations. This local stability is a consequence of the\nsmoothness of the regularizer when restricted to the active submanifold, which\nin turn plays a pivotal role to get a closed form expression for the variations\nof the predictor w.r.t. observations. We also show that, for a variety of\nregularizers, including polyhedral ones or the group Lasso and its analysis\ncounterpart, this divergence formula holds Lebesgue almost everywhere.When the\nperturbation is random (with an appropriate continuous distribution), this\nallows us to derive an unbiased estimator of the degrees of freedom and of the\nrisk of the estimator prediction.Our results hold true without requiring the\ndesign matrix to be full column rank.They generalize those already known in the\nliterature such as the Lasso problem, the general Lasso problem (analysis\n$\\ell^1$-penalty), or the group Lasso where existing results for the latter\nassume that the design is full column rank.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 17:04:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 13:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 14:26:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 18:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-11"}

The structured surfaces we\nstudy comprise one basal plane bilayer of ice with varying lattice parameters\nand interaction strengths. We show that what determines the propensity for\nnucleation is not just the surface attraction, but also the orientational\nordering imposed on liquid water near a surface. In particular, varying the\nratio of the surface's attraction and orientational ordering can change the\nmechanism by which nucleation occurs: ice can nucleate on the structured\nsurface even when the orientational ordering imposed by the surface is weak, as\nthe water molecules that interact strongly with the surface are themselves a\ngood template for further growth. We also show that lattice matching is\nimportant for heterogeneous nucleation on the structured surface we study.

The GIBCs in the time domain are heuristically\nderived from the corresponding conditions in the time harmonic regime. The\nlatters are frequency dependent except the one of order 0; hence the formers\nare non-local in time in general. The error estimates in the time regime can be\nderived from the ones in the time harmonic regime when the frequency dependence\nis well-controlled. This idea is originally due to Nguyen and Vogelius in\n\\cite{NguyenVogelius2} for the cloaking context. In this paper, we present the\nanalysis to the GIBCs of orders 0 and 1. To implement the ideas in\n\\cite{NguyenVogelius2}, we revise and extend the work of Haddar, Joly, and\nNguyen in \\cite{HJNg1}, where the GIBCs were investigated for a fixed frequency\nin three dimensions. Even though we heavily follow the strategy in\n\\cite{NguyenVogelius2}, our analysis on the stability contains new ingredients\nand ideas. First, instead of considering the difference between solutions of\nthe exact model and the approximate model, we consider the difference between\ntheir derivatives in time. This simple idea helps us to avoid the machinery\nused in \\cite{NguyenVogelius2} concerning the integrability with respect to\nfrequency in the low frequency regime. Second, in the high frequency regime,\nthe Morawetz multiplier technique used in \\cite{NguyenVogelius2} does not fit\ndirectly in our setting. Our proof makes use of a result by H\\\"ormander in\n\\cite{Hor}. Another important part of the analysis in this paper is the\nwell-posedness in the time domain for the approximate problems imposed with\nGIBCs on the boundary of the obstacle, which are non-local in time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 18:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-23"}

In fact, what was intended was a field with a\ndiscontinuity at $w$, that was uniform between $0<x<w$. In this paper we show\nthat the discontinuity is required for the Strukov model derivation to be\ncompleted, and thus the derivation as given does not describe a situation with\na uniform field across the entire device. The discontinuity can be described as\na Heaviside function, $H$, located on $w$, for which there are three common\nsingle-valued approximations for $H(w)$. The Strukov model as intended includes\nan approximation for the Heaviside function (the field is taken to be the same\nas that across the $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$ part of the device). We compare\napproximations and give solutions. We then extend the description of the field\nto a more-realistic continuously varying sigmoidal transition between two\nuniform fields and demonstrate that the centro-symmetric approximation model\n(taking the field as being the average of the fields across $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$\nand $R_{\\mathrm{off}}$) is a better single-point model of that situation: the\nother two approximations over or underestimate the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 18:17:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 14:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-24"}

For both\naxisymmetric and non-axisymmetric linear perturbations we provide the general\nequations that can be applied locally to specific systems to establish whether\nthey are unstable and, in case of instability, to determine the kind of\nevolution (monotonically growing or over-stable) and the growth rates of\nunstable modes. We present results for models of rotating plasmas\nrepresentative of Milky Way-like galaxy coronae and cool-cores of galaxy\nclusters. It is shown that the unstable modes arise from a combination of\nthermal, magnetothermal, magnetorotational and heat-flux-driven buoyancy\ninstabilities.

While\nprevious research has been motivated by the understanding that, through\ncooperation, multi-agent systems can achieve tasks that are unachievable by\nsingle-agent systems, there are no formal characterizations of situations where\ncooperation is required to achieve a goal, thus warranting the application of\nmulti-agent systems. In this paper, we provide such a formal discussion from\nthe planning aspect. We first show that determining whether there is required\ncooperation (RC) is intractable is general. Then, by dividing the problems that\nrequire cooperation (referred to as RC problems) into two classes -- problems\nwith heterogeneous and homogeneous agents, we aim to identify all the\nconditions that can cause RC in these two classes. We establish that when none\nof these identified conditions hold, the problem is single-agent solvable.\nFurthermore, with a few assumptions, we provide an upper bound on the minimum\nnumber of agents required for RC problems with homogeneous agents. This study\nnot only provides new insights into multi-agent planning, but also has many\napplications. For example, in human-robot teaming, when a robot cannot achieve\na task, it may be due to RC. In such cases, the human teammate should be\ninformed and, consequently, coordinate with other available robots for a\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 20:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-24"}

Also, radio-loud quasars\nare found to have almost constant mean values of dust mass along redshift and\noptical luminosity bins. In addition, we find that radio-loud quasars at lower\noptical luminosities tend to have on average higher FIR and 250-micron\nluminosity with respect to radio-quiet quasars with the same optical\nluminosites. Even if we use a two-temperature grey-body model to describe the\nFIR data, the FIR luminosity excess remains at lower optical luminosities.\nThese results suggest that powerful radio jets are associated with star\nformation especially at lower accretion rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 00:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

To enable reliable data collection and make business decisions fast,\nhigh throughput storage and high-performance analysis of massive meter data\nbecome crucial for grid companies. Considering the advantage of high\nefficiency, fault tolerance, and price-performance of Hadoop and Hive systems,\nthey are frequently deployed as underlying platform for big data processing.\nHowever, in real business use cases, these data analysis applications typically\ninvolve multidimensional range queries (MDRQ) as well as batch reading and\nstatistics on the meter data. While Hive is high-performance at complex data\nbatch reading and analysis, it lacks efficient indexing techniques for MDRQ.\n  In this paper, we propose DGFIndex, an index structure for Hive that\nefficiently supports MDRQ for massive meter data. DGFIndex divides the data\nspace into cubes using the grid file technique. Unlike the existing indexes in\nHive, which stores all combinations of multiple dimensions, DGFIndex only\nstores the information of cubes. This leads to smaller index size and faster\nquery processing. Furthermore, with pre-computing user-defined aggregations of\neach cube, DGFIndex only needs to access the boundary region for aggregation\nquery. Our comprehensive experiments show that DGFIndex can save significant\ndisk space in comparison with the existing indexes in Hive and the query\nperformance with DGFIndex is 2-50 times faster than existing indexes in Hive\nand HadoopDB for aggregation query, 2-5 times faster than both for\nnon-aggregation query, 2-75 times faster than scanning the whole table in\ndifferent query selectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 02:44:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 02:32:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 09:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-10"}

The background dynamics correspond to a generalised Chaplygin gas\ncosmology, but the perturbations have a zero sound speed. The tension between\nthe value of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, determined by Planck data plus WMAP\npolarisation (Planck+WP) and that determined by the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) can be alleviated by energy transfer from dark matter to vacuum\n($\\alpha>0$). A positive $\\alpha$ increases the allowed values of $H_0$ due to\nparameter degeneracy within the model using only CMB data. Combining with\nadditional datasets of including supernova type Ia (SN Ia) and baryon acoustic\noscillation (BAO), we can significantly tighten the bounds on $\\alpha$.\nRedshift-space distortions (RSD), which constrain the linear growth of\nstructure, provide the tightest constraints on vacuum interaction when combined\nwith Planck+WP, and prefer energy transfer from vacuum to dark matter\n($\\alpha<0$) which suppresses the growth of structure.

For the RKKY regime with a small Kondo coupling, the\ntransverse susceptibility does not decrease below the transition temperature\nwhile the longitudinal susceptibility decreases as expected from the mean field\npicture. In the competing region between the RKKY interaction and the Kondo\neffect, however, both longitudinal and transverse susceptibilities decrease\nbelow the transition temperature. The results obtained naturally explain the\ntemperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility observed in\nCeT$_2$Al$_{10}$ ($T$=Ru,Os,Fe) family.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 06:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The new solar abundance is in a very good agreement with the\nmeteoritic value. The used modern spectrosynthesis tools, the agreement with\nthe meteoritic value and with the results in open cluster M67, known to be a\nsolar analogue, make our solar determination very robust. At the same time, the\nfluorine measurement in the above-mentioned open clusters is the first step in\nthe understanding of its evolution during the last $\\sim$10 Gyr in the Galactic\ndisk. In order to develop this project, a larger sample of open clusters is\nrequired, so that it would allow us to trace the evolution of fluorine as a\nfunction of time and, in turn, to better understand its origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 09:18:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 09:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In\nthis study, we aim to determine the critical strength of the UV flux above\nwhich the formation of molecular hydrogen remains suppressed for a sample of\nfive distinct halos at $z>10$ by employing a higher order chemical solver and a\nJeans resolution of 32 cells. We presume that such flux is emitted by PopII\nstars implying atmospheric temperatures of $\\rm 10^{4}$~K. We performed\nthree-dimensional cosmological simulations and varied the strength of the UV\nflux below the Lyman limit in units of $\\rm J_{21}$. Our findings show that the\nvalue of $\\rm J_{21}^{crit}$ varies from halo to halo and is sensitive to the\nlocal thermal conditions of the gas. For the simulated halos it varies from\n400-700 with the exception of one halo where $\\rm J_{21}^{crit} \\geq 1500$.\nThis has important implications for the formation of direct collapse black\nholes and their estimated population at z > 6. It reduces the number density of\ndirect collapse black holes by almost three orders of magnitude compared to the\nprevious estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 10:18:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 14:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

To date, there have been two key\nexperimental observations supporting this hypothesis: i) neuronal avalanches\nwith power law distribution of size and ii) long-range temporal correlations\n(LRTCs) in the amplitude of neural oscillations. The case for how these\nmaximise dynamic range of information processing and communication is still\nbeing made and because a significant substrate for information coding and\ntransmission is neural synchrony it is of interest to link synchronisation\nmeasures with those of criticality. We propose a framework for characterising\ncriticality in synchronisation based on a new metric of phase synchronisation\n(rate of change of phase difference) and a set of methods we have developed for\ndetecting LRTCs. We test this framework against two classical models of\ncriticality (Ising and Kuramoto) and recently described variants of these\nmodels aimed to more closely represent human brain dynamics. From these\nsimulations we determine the parameters at which these systems show evidence of\nLRTCs in phase synchronisation. We demonstrate proof of principle by analysing\npairs of human simultaneous EEG and EMG time series, suggesting that LRTCs of\ncorticomuscular phase synchronisation can be detected in the resting state. The\nexistence of LRTCs in fluctuations of phase synchronisation suggests that these\nfluctuations are governed by non-local behaviour. This has important\nimplications regarding the conditions under which one should expect to see\nLRTCs in phase synchronisation. Specifically, brain resting states may exhibit\nLRTCs reflecting a state of readiness facilitating rapid task-dependent shifts\ntowards and away from synchronous states that abolish LRTCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 10:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

The goal is to explore magnetic effects\non the layer of the atmosphere that is ionized and heated by stellar EUV\nradiation, and the imprint of these effects on the Ly$\\alpha$ transmission\nspectrum. The simulations are axisymmetric, isothermal, and include both\nrotation and azimuth-averaged stellar tides. Mass density is converted to\natomic hydrogen density through the assumption of ionization equilibrium. The\nthree-zone structure -- polar dead zone, mid-latitude wind zone, and equatorial\ndead zone -- found in previous analytic calculations is confirmed. For a\nmagnetic field comparable to that of Jupiter, the equatorial dead zone, which\nis confined by the magnetic field and corotates with the planet, contributes at\nleast half of the transit signal. For even stronger fields, the gas escaping in\nthe mid-latitude wind zone is found to have a smaller contribution to the\ntransit depth than the equatorial dead zone. Transmission spectra computed from\nthe simulations are compared to HST STIS and ACS data for HD 209458b and HD\n189733b, and the range of model parameters consistent with the data is found.\nThe central result of this paper is that the transit depth increases strongly\nwith magnetic field strength when the hydrogen ionization layer is magnetically\ndominated, for dipole magnetic field $B_0 > 10\\ {\\rm G}$. Hence transit depth\nis sensitive to magnetic field strength, in addition to standard quantities\nsuch as the ratio of thermal to gravitational binding energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 13:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

More\nspecifically, for an a priori known value of lambda, the vector field has a\nunique singular point of dipole type and can be used to steer the unicycle to a\ngoal configuration. Furthermore, for the unique value of lambda that the vector\nfield has a continuum of singular points, the integral curves are used to\ndefine flows around obstacles. An almost global feedback motion plan can then\nbe constructed by suitably blending attractive and repulsive vector fields in a\nstatic obstacle environment. The method does not suffer from the appearance of\nsinks (stable nodes) away from goal point. Compared to other similar methods\nwhich are free of local minima, the proposed approach does not require any\nparameter tuning to render the desired convergence properties. The paper also\naddresses the extension of the method to the distributed coordination and\ncontrol of multiple robots, where each robot needs to navigate to a goal\nconfiguration while avoiding collisions with the remaining robots, and while\nusing local information only. More specifically, based on the results which\napply to the single-robot case, a motion coordination protocol is presented\nwhich guarantees the safety of the multi-robot system and the almost global\nconvergence of the robots to their goal configurations. The efficacy of the\nproposed methodology is demonstrated via simulation results in static and\ndynamic environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 14:12:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 15:55:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 20:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

In many cases, climate might\nbe expected to influence body size by altering thermoregulation, energetics or\nfood availability. However, observed body size changes can result from\necological processes (e.g., growth, selection, population dynamics), yet may\nalso be due to imperfect observation. We used two extensive datasets to\nevaluate alternative hypotheses for recently reported changes in the observed\nbody size of plethodontid salamanders. We found that mean adult body size of\nsalamanders can be highly sensitive to survey conditions, particularly\nrainfall, such that smaller individuals are more likely to be sampled under dry\nconditions. This systematic bias in the detection of individuals across a range\nin body size would result in a signature of body size reduction in relation to\nreported climate trends when it is simply observation error. We also identify\nconsiderable variability in body size distributions among years that shows\ncorrespondence with rainfall. This suggests that annual variation in growth or\nshifting population age structure could also result in a correlation between\nclimate and mean body size. Finally, our study demonstrates that measures of\nmean adult body size can be highly variable among surveys and that large sample\nsizes may be required to make reliable inferences. Identifying the effects of\nclimate change is critical for future research in ecology and conservation.\nResearchers should be aware that observed body size changes in some organisms\nmay be a result of true ecological processes or systematic bias due to\nnon-random sampling of populations. Ultimately, the credibility of ecological\nresearch related to climate change depends on researchers demonstrating a\nthorough consideration of alternative hypotheses for observed changes in\nspecies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 14:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-24"}
