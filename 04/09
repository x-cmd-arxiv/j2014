Changes in\nboth the magnetic field and the particle acceleration efficiency are explored\nas causes of flares. Generally, external Compton emission appears to describe\nthe available data better than a synchrotron self-Compton scenario, and in\nparticular orphan optical flares are difficult to produce in the SSC framework.\nX-ray soft-excesses, {\\gamma}-ray spectral hardening, and the detections at\nvery high energies of certain FSRQs during flares find natural explanations in\nthe EC scenario with particle acceleration change. Likewise, optical flares\nwith/without {\\gamma}-ray counterparts can be explained by different\nallocations of energy between the magnetization and particle acceleration,\nwhich may be related to the orientation of the magnetic field relative to the\njet flow. We also calculate the degree of linear polarization and polarization\nangle as a function of time for a jet with helical magnetic field. Tightening\nof the magnetic helix immediately downstream of the jet perturbations, where\nflares occur, can be sufficient to explain the increases in the degree of\npolarization and a rotation by >= 180 degree of the observed polarization\nangle, if light-travel-time effects are properly considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 16:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The prepare & measure SARG04 is proven to be able to\ngenerate a key up to two-photon emission events. In MDI setting we show that\nthe key generation is possible from the event with single or two-photon\nemission by a party and single-photon emission by the other party, but the\ntwo-photon emission event by both parties cannot contribute to the key\ngeneration. On the contrary to prepare & measure SARG04 protocol where the\nexperimental setup is exactly the same as BB84, the measurement setup for\nSARG04 in MDI setting cannot be the same as that for BB84 since the measurement\nsetup for BB84 in MDI setting induces too many bit errors.

We generalize an existing framework [Bashan et al, 2008] for\nadaptive allocation of sensing resources to the dynamic case, accounting for\ntime-varying target behavior such as transitions to neighboring cells and\nvarying amplitudes over a potentially long time horizon. The proposed adaptive\nsensing policy is driven by minimization of a modified version of the\npreviously introduced ARAP objective function, which is a surrogate function\nfor mean squared error within locations containing targets. We provide\ntheoretical upper bounds on the performance of adaptive sensing policies by\nanalyzing solutions with oracle knowledge of target locations, gaining insight\ninto the effect of target motion and amplitude variation as well as sparsity.\nExact minimization of the multi-stage objective function is infeasible, but\nmyopic optimization yields a closed-form solution. We propose a simple\nnon-myopic extension, the Dynamic Adaptive Resource Allocation Policy (D-ARAP),\nthat allocates a fraction of resources for exploring all locations rather than\nsolely exploiting the current belief state. Our numerical studies indicate that\nD-ARAP has the following advantages: (a) it is more robust than the myopic\npolicy to noise, missing data, and model mismatch; (b) it performs comparably\nto well-known approximate dynamic programming solutions but at significantly\nlower computational complexity; and (c) it improves greatly upon non-adaptive\nuniform resource allocation in terms of estimation error and probability of\ndetection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 16:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-09"}

The inertial range\nshows a clear $k^{-2}$ spectrum and is the first example of fully isotropic\nmagnetically dominated MHD turbulence exhibiting weak turbulence scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 17:59:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 18:05:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 19:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-23"}

Generic potentials are constructed\nwhich allow for analytical estimates of the quantum dynamics in the\nnon-relativistic deep tunneling regime, in terms of the tunneling distance,\nbarrier height and mass (or moment of inertia). For cyclic systems, the results\nmay be scaled to agree well with periodic potentials for which semi-analytical\nresults in terms of Mathieu functions exist. Starting from a wavepacket which\nis initially localized in one of the potential wells, the subsequent periodic\ntunneling is associated with tunneling velocities. These velocities (or angular\nvelocities) are evaluated as the ratio of the flux densities versus the\nprobability densities. The maximum velocities are found under the top of the\nbarrier where they scale as the square root of the ratio of barrier height and\nmass (or moment of inertia), independent of the tunneling distance.

It seems\nnatural to ask whether these advances in memory devices could also translate\ninto a new class of logic devices.\n  What makes logic devices different from memory is the need for one device to\ndrive another and this calls for gain, directionality and input-output\nisolation as exemplified by the transistor. With this in mind we will try to\npresent our perspective on how W and R devices in general, spintronic or\notherwise, could be integrated into transistor-like switches that can be\ninterconnected to build complex circuits without external amplifiers or clocks.\nWe will argue that the most common switch used to implement digital logic based\non complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors can be viewed as\nan integrated W-R unit having an input-output asymmetry that give it gain and\ndirectionality. Such a viewpoint is not intended to provide any insight into\nthe operation of CMOS switches, but rather as an aid to understanding how W and\nR units based on spins and magnets can be combined to build transistor-like\nswitches. Next we will discuss the standard W and R units used for magnetic\nmemory devices and present one way to integrate them into a single unit with\nthe input electrically isolated from the output.

The low level of confusion along the line of sight testified by CO\nobservations makes this region an ideal case. We find very different values of\nthe power spectrum slope from tile to tile but also from wavelength to\nwavelength (2 < \\beta < 3), with similarities between fields attributable to\ncomponents located at the same distance. Thanks to the comparison with models\nof turbulence, an explanation of the determined slopes in terms of the fractal\ngeometry is also provided, and possible relations with the underlying physics\nare investigated. In particular, an anti-correlation between ISM fractal\ndimension and star formation efficiency is found for the two main distance\ncomponents observed in these fields. A possible link between the fractal\nproperties of the diffuse emission and the resulting clump mass function is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 20:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

Sources in this transition phase are compact and\nemit intensely in infrared wavelengths, making high spatial resolution\nobservations in the infrared mandatory to investigate the shaping process of\nPNe. Interferometric VLTI IR observations have revealed compelling evidence of\ndisks at the cores of PNe, but the limited sensitivity, strong observational\nconstraints, and limited spatial coverage place severe limits on the universal\nuse of this technique. Inspired by the successful detection of proto-planetary\ndisks using spectro-astrometric observations, we apply here for the first time\nthis technique to search for sub-arcsecond structures in PNe. Our exploratory\nstudy using CRIRES (CRyogenic high-resolution Infra-Red Echelle Spectrograph)\ncommissioning data of the proto-PN IRAS 17516-2525 and the young PN SwSt 1 has\nrevealed small-sized structures after the spectro-astrometric analysis of the\ntwo sources.

The spectroscopic observations required to perform\nspectro-astrometry of sources in the transition towards the PN phase are less\ntime consuming and much more sensitive than VLTI IR observations. The results\npresented here open a new window in the search of the small-sized collimating\nagents that shape the complex morphologies of extremely axisymmetric PNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 23:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We show that the\nabrupt waveform termination contains significant information that affects\nparameter-estimation accuracy. If the sharp cutoff is not physically motivated,\nthis extra information can lead to misleadingly good accuracy claims. We also\nshow that using waveforms with a cutoff as templates to recover complete\nsignals can lead to biases in parameter estimates. We evaluate when the\ninformation content in the cutoff is likely to be important in both cases.

Their\nBFS-tree construction time was $O(D \\log^2 n)$ rounds, where $D$ is the network\ndiameter and $n$ is the number of nodes.

In addition, under optical excitation near the quantum\nwells material absorption edge we observed the photocurrent declines with\nincreasing reverse bias, i.e. the negative differential photoconductance.

With mixed timescales, as for example in active or granular fluids\nor in turbulence, temperature is no more well-defined, the dynamical nature of\nfluctuations fully emerges and a Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem\n(GFDT) applies. Here, we study experimentally the mixed timescale regime by\nstudying fluctuations and linear response in the Brownian motion of a rotating\nintruder immersed in a vibro-fluidized granular medium.

The ability\nof melanin to covalently bind amine functional groups was confirmed by\nquantification of the corresponding binding sites on dopamine-melanin\naggregates. Furthermore it is possible to redissolve dopamine-melanin\naggregates in strongly alkaline solutions. The obtained small melanin grains\nwere used to build layer-by-layer deposits with poly(diallyldimethylammonium).\n  Different methods of dopamine oxidation to grow melanin films at\nsolid--liquid interfaces were developed.

In this context a higher permeability for\npositively charged and neutral probes than for negatively charged ones was\nconfirmed for one preparation method.\n  The adsorption of proteins on dopamine-melanin coatings was explained as\ncombination of electrostatic and strong, most probably covalent, interactions.\nTo obtain this explanation, the zeta-potential of dopamine-melanin deposits has\nbeen measured as a function of pH.\n  The formation of melanin by dopamine oxidation in layer-by-layer films of\npoly(L-lysine) (PLL) and hyaluronate (HA) was studied: Melanin is able to\nhomogeneously fill $(\\text{PLL-HA})_n$ films and the obtained\npolyelectrolyte-melanin composites can be detached from their substrate as\nfree-standing membranes prepared by a biomimetic method in mild conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2014 09:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-10"}

The AGN structure can be further probed by using the\ngeometry-sensitive technique of polarimetry, yet the pairing between observed\npolarization and Seyfert type remains poorly examined. Based on archival data,\nI report here the first compilation of 53 estimated AGN inclinations matched\nwith ultraviolet/optical continuum polarization measurements. Corrections,\nbased on the polarization of broad emission lines, are applied to the sample of\nSeyfert-2 AGN to remove dilution by starburst light and derive information\nabout the scattered continuum alone. The resulting compendium agrees with past\nempirical results, i.e. type-1 AGN show low polarization degrees (P < 1%)\npredominantly associated with a polarization position angle parallel to the\nprojected radio axis of the system, while type-2 objects show stronger\npolarization percentages (P > 7%) with perpendicular polarization angles. The\ntransition between type-1 and type-2 inclination occurs between 45 and 60\ndegrees without noticeable impact on P. The compendium is further used as a\ntest to investigate the relevance of four AGN models.

The octamer state was considered to be a spin-singlet state\ninduced by a Peieirls instability through the strong anisotropy of $d$\norbitals, the so-called orbital Peierls state. We reexamine this picture by\ntaking into account the spin-orbit coupling which was ignored in the previous\nstudy. We derive a low-energy effective model between $j_{\\rm eff}=1/2$\nquasispins on Ir$^{4+}$ cations in an octamer from the multiorbital Hubbard\nmodel with the strong spin-orbit coupling by performing the perturbation\nexpansion from the strong correlation limit. The effective Hamiltonian is in\nthe form of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model but with an additional interaction, a\nsymmetric off-diagonal exchange interaction originating from the perturbation\nprocess including both d-d and d-p-d hopping. Analyzing the effective\nHamiltonian on two sites and the octamer by the exact diagonalization, we find\nthat there is a competition between a spin-singlet state and a quadrupolar\nstate. The former singlet state is a conventional one, adiabatically connected\nto the orbital-Peierls state. On the other hand, the latter quadrupolar state\nis stabilized by the additional interaction, which consists of a linear\ncombination of different total spin momenta along the spin quantization axis.\nIn the competing region, the model exhibits paramagnetic behavior with a\nrenormalized small effective moment at low temperature. This peculiar remnant\nparamagnetism is not obtained in the Kitaev-Heisenberg model without the\nadditional interaction.

Two particularly promising applications have been explored\nduring the past decade: First, photon-based quantum communication, which\nguarantees unbreakable encryption but still has to be scaled to high rates over\nlarge distances. Second, quantum computation, which will fundamentally enhance\ncomputability if it can be scaled to a large number of quantum bits. It was\nrealized early on that a hybrid system of light and matter qubits could solve\nthe scalability problem of both fields - that of communication via quantum\nrepeaters, that of computation via an optical interconnect between smaller\nquantum processors. To this end, the development of a robust two-qubit gate\nthat allows to link distant computational nodes is \"a pressing challenge\". Here\nwe demonstrate such a quantum gate between the spin state of a single trapped\natom and the polarization state of an optical photon contained in a faint laser\npulse. The presented gate mechanism is deterministic, robust and expected to be\napplicable to almost any matter qubit. It is based on reflecting the photonic\nqubit from a cavity that provides strong light-matter coupling. To demonstrate\nits versatility, we use the quantum gate to create atom-photon,\natom-photon-photon, and photon-photon entangled states from separable input\nstates. We expect our experiment to break ground for various applications,\nincluding the generation of atomic and photonic cluster states,\nSchr\\\"odinger-cat states, deterministic photonic Bell-state measurements, and\nquantum communication using a redundant quantum parity code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2014 12:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-10"}

The goal of this paper is\nto estimate the effect on mortality of premature babies being delivered in a\nhigh-level NICU vs. a low-level NICU through an observational study where there\nare unmeasured confounders as well as nonignorable missing covariates. We\nconsider the use of excess travel time as an instrumental variable (IV) to\ncontrol for unmeasured confounders. In order for an IV to be valid, we must\ncondition on confounders of the IV---outcome relationship, for example, month\nprenatal care started must be conditioned on for excess travel time to be a\nvalid IV. However, sometimes month prenatal care started is missing, and the\nmissingness may be nonignorable because it is related to the not fully measured\nmother's/infant's risk of complications. We develop a method to estimate the\ncausal effect of a treatment using an IV when there are nonignorable missing\ncovariates as in our data, where we allow the missingness to depend on the\nfully observed outcome as well as the partially observed compliance class,\nwhich is a proxy for the unmeasured risk of complications. A simulation study\nshows that under our nonignorable missingness assumption, the commonly used\nestimation methods, complete-case analysis and multiple imputation by chained\nequations assuming missingness at random, provide biased estimates, while our\nmethod provides approximately unbiased estimates. We apply our method to the\nNICU study and find evidence that high-level NICUs significantly reduce deaths\nfor babies of small gestational age, whereas for almost mature babies like 37\nweeks, the level of NICUs makes little difference. A sensitivity analysis is\nconducted to assess the sensitivity of our conclusions to key assumptions about\nthe missing covariates.

We show that, below the convective\nenvelope of an AGB star, variable magnetic fields induce a natural expansion,\npermitted by the almost ideal MHD conditions, in which the radial velocity\ngrows as the second power of the radius. We then study the convective envelope,\nwhere the complexity of macro-turbulence allows only for a schematic analytical\ntreatment.

This allows us to determine the phase diagram for all\ncolor numbers $N$, and the critical behavior for all $N \\ne 4$. In the case of\ntwo colors, $N=2$, a partially ordered product phase separates the paramagnetic\nand ferromagnetic phases in the strong-coupling regime. This phase is absent\nfor all $N>2$, i.e., there is a direct phase boundary between the paramagnetic\nand ferromagnetic phases. In agreement with the quantum version of the\nAizenman-Wehr theorem, all phase transitions are continuous, even if their\nclean counterparts are of first order. We also discuss the various critical and\nmulticritical points. They are all of infinite-randomness type, but depending\non the coupling strength, they belong to different universality classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2014 14:58:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 18:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-09"}

We decided to look at men's basketball, football,\nand baseball. We wanted to use an approach that could definitively determine\nteam skill from the games played, and then use a machine-learning algorithm to\ncalculate the correct coach skills for each team in a given year. We created a\nnetworks-based model to calculate team skill from historical game data. A\ndigraph was created for each year in each sport. Nodes represented teams, and\nedges represented a game played between two teams. The arrowhead pointed\ntowards the losing team. We calculated the team skill of each graph using a\nright-hand eigenvector centrality measure. This way, teams that beat good teams\nwill be ranked higher than teams that beat mediocre teams. The eigenvector\ncentrality rankings for most years were well correlated with tournament\nperformance and poll-based rankings. We assumed that the relationship between\ncoach skill $C_s$, player skill $P_s$, and team skill $T_s$ was $C_s \\cdot P_s\n= T_s$. We then created a function to describe the probability that a given\nscore difference would occur based on player skill and coach skill. We\nmultiplied the probabilities of all edges in the network together to find the\nprobability that the correct network would occur with any given player skill\nand coach skill matrix. We was able to determine player skill as a function of\nteam skill and coach skill, eliminating the need to optimize two unknown\nmatrices. The top five coaches in each year were noted, and the top coach of\nall time was calculated by dividing the number of times that coach ranked in\nthe yearly top five by the years said coach had been active.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 22:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-11"}

The relative displacements at\nthese interfaces lead to fretting-wear which reduces the average life\nexpectancy of the structure. Frequency response functions are calculated\nnumerically by using the multi-harmonic balance method (mHBM). The dynamic\nLagrangian frequency-time method is used to calculate contact forces in the\nfrequency domain. A new strategy for solving nonlinear systems based on dual\ntime stepping is applied. This method is faster than using Newton solvers. It\nwas used successfully for solving Nonlinear CFD equations in the frequency\ndomain. This new approach allows identifying the steady state of worn systems\nby integrating wear rate equations a on dual time scale. The dual time\nequations are integrated by an implicit scheme.
