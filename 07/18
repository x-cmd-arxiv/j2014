The jet's axisymmetric mode is excited at the nozzle lip\nthrough a sinusoidal modulation of the flow rate at amplitudes ranging from 0.1\n% to 100 %. The instantaneous flow field is measured via particle image\nvelocimetry and decomposed into a mean and periodic part utilizing proper\northogonal decomposition. Local linear stability analysis is applied to the\nmeasured mean flow adopting a weakly nonparallel flow approach. The resulting\nglobal perturbation field is carefully compared to the measurements in terms of\nspatial growth rate, phase velocity, and phase and amplitude distribution. It\nis shown that the stability wave model accurately predicts the excited flow\noscillations during their entire growth phase and during a large part of their\ndecay phase. The stability wave model applies over a wide range of forcing\namplitudes, showing no pronounced sensitivity to the strength of nonlinear\nsaturation. The upstream displacement of the neutral point and the successive\nreduction of gain with increasing forcing amplitude is very well captured by\nthe stability wave model. At very strong forcing (>40%), the flow becomes\nessentially stable to the axisymmetric mode. For these extreme cases, the\nprediction deteriorates from the measurements due to an interaction of the\nforced wave with the geometric confinement of the nozzle. Moreover, the model\nfails far downstream in a region where energy is transferred from the\noscillation back to the mean flow. This study supports previously conducted\nmean flow stability analysis of self-excited flow oscillations in the cylinder\nwake and in the vortex breakdown bubble and extends the methodology to\nexternally forced convectively unstable flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 16:31:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Despite the spectral instability of many forms of the MRI, this\nproves to be a natural method of analysis that is well-suited to deal with the\nnon-self-adjoint nature of the linear MRI equations. We find that the fastest\ngrowing linear MRI structures on both local and global domains can look very\ndifferent to the eigenmodes, invariably resembling waves shearing with the\nbackground flow (shear waves). In addition, such structures can grow many times\nfaster than the least stable eigenmode over long time periods, and be localized\nin a completely different region of space. These ideas lead -- for both\naxisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes -- to a natural connection between the\nglobal MRI and the local shearing box approximation. By illustrating that the\nfastest growing global structure is well described by the ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs) governing a single shear wave, we find that the shearing box\nis a very sensible approximation for the linear MRI, contrary to many previous\nclaims. Since the shear wave ODEs are most naturally understood using nonmodal\nanalysis techniques, we conclude by analyzing local MRI growth over finite\ntime-scales using these methods. The strong growth over a wide range of\nwave-numbers suggests that nonmodal linear physics could be of fundamental\nimportance in MRI turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 17:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-01"}

Based on physical considerations, we\nmake the further crucial assumption that these two parameters are in turn\ndistributed according to a bivariate Gaussian, with its own mean and covariance\nmatrix. Tests using numerical simulations explicitly show that with this\ncompact description one can correctly model redshift-space distorsions on all\nscales, fully capturing the overall linear and nonlinear dynamics of the galaxy\nflow at different separations. In particular, we naturally obtain\nGaussian/exponential, skewed/unskewed distribution functions, depending on\nseparation as observed in simulations and data. Also, the recently proposed\nsingle-Gaussian description of redshift-space distortions is included in this\nmodel as a limiting case, when the bivariate Gaussian is collapsed to a\ntwo-dimensional Dirac delta function. We also show how this description\nnaturally allows for the Taylor expansion of $1+\\xi_S(\\vec{s})$ around\n$1+\\xi_R(r)$, which leads to the Kaiser linear formula when truncated to second\norder, expliciting its connection with the moments of the velocity distribution\nfunctions. More work is needed, but these results indicate a very promising\npath to make definitive progress in our program to improve RSD estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 17:51:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 17:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

We also\nconsider related problems such as computing the generalized inner product of\nvectors held on different servers. We give a general framework for reducing\nthese multi-player problems to their two-player counterparts, showing that the\nrandomized $s$-player communication complexity of these problems is at least\n$s$ times the randomized two-player communication complexity. Provided the\nproblem has a certain amount of algebraic symmetry, which we formally define,\nwe can show the hardest input distribution is a symmetric distribution, and\ntherefore apply a recent multi-player lower bound technique of Phillips et al.\nFurther, we give new two-player lower bounds for a number of these problems. In\nparticular, our optimal lower bound for the two-player version of the matrix\nrank problem resolves an open question of Sun and Wang.\n  A common feature of our lower bounds is that they apply even to the special\n\"threshold promise\" versions of these problems, wherein the underlying\nquantity, e.g., rank, is promised to be one of just two values, one on each\nside of some critical threshold.

Having been used to construct perturbative\nexpansions, it was recently shown that they can also be extended past\nperturbation theory by making use of resurgent transseries. These yield formal\nnonperturbative solutions, showing integrability of the holomorphic anomaly\nequations at the nonperturbative level. This paper takes such constructions one\nstep further by working out in great detail the specific example of topological\nstrings in the mirror of the local CP2 toric Calabi-Yau background, and by\naddressing the associated (resurgent) large-order analysis of both perturbative\nand multi-instanton sectors. In particular, analyzing the asymptotic growth of\nthe perturbative free energies, one finds contributions from three different\ninstanton actions related by Z_3 symmetry, alongside another action related to\nthe Kahler parameter. Resurgent transseries methods then compute, from the\nextended holomorphic anomaly equations, higher instanton sectors and it is\nshown that these precisely control the asymptotic behavior of the perturbative\nfree energies, as dictated by resurgence. The asymptotic large-order growth of\nthe one-instanton sector unveils the presence of resonance, i.e., each\ninstanton action is necessarily joined by its symmetric contribution. The\nstructure of different resurgence relations is extensively checked at the\nnumerical level, both in the holomorphic limit and in the general\nnonholomorphic case, always showing excellent agreement with transseries data\ncomputed out of the nonperturbative holomorphic anomaly equations. The\nresurgence relations further imply that the string free energy displays an\nintricate multi-branched Borel structure, and that resonance must be properly\ntaken into account in order to describe the full transseries solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 20:15:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 19:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Different\nmethods use both different NCFs and different ASs. Thus, it is unclear whether\nthe superiority of a method comes from its NCF, its AS, or both. We already\nshowed on MI-GRAAL and IsoRankN that combining NCF of one method and AS of\nanother method can lead to a new superior method.

First, we ask how much of the node similarity information in NCF\nshould come from sequence data compared to topology data. Existing methods\ndetermine this more-less arbitrarily, which could affect the resulting\nalignment(s). Second, when topology is used in NCF, we ask how large the size\nof the neighborhoods of the compared nodes should be.

Thus, the combination of MI-GRAAL's NCF\nand GHOST's AS could be a new superior method for certain data. Also, which\namount of sequence information is used within NCF does not affect alignment\nquality, while the inclusion of topological information is crucial. Finally,\nlarger neighborhood sizes are preferred, but often, it is the second largest\nsize that is superior, and using this size would decrease computational\ncomplexity.\n  Together, our results give several general recommendations for a fair\nevaluation of network alignment methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 20:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-21"}

We add scalar\npotential disorder to the system, while remaining at charge neutrality on\naverage. Numerical solution of the BdG equations suggests that while in the\nstrong attraction regime (U > Uc) disorder has the usual effect of suppressing\nsuperconductivity, in the weak attraction regime (U < Uc) weak disorder\nenhances superconductivity. In the weak attraction regime, disorder that is too\nstrong eventually suppresses superconductivity, i.e., there is an optimal\ndisorder strength that maximizes the critical temperature Tc. Our numerical\nresults also suggest that in the weakly disordered regime, mesoscopic\ninhomogeneities enhance superconductivity significantly more than what is\npredicted by a spatially uniform mean-field theory a` la Abrikosov-Gorkov. In\nthis regime, superconductivity consists of rare phase-coherent superconducting\nislands.

This serves as a simple analogue to the\nreactive Euler equations, permitting one to gain insight into the nonlinear\ndynamics of detonation waves. Chemical kinetics were modeled using a two-step\nreaction with distinct induction and reaction zones. An evolution equation for\nthe detonation structure was derived using the method of matched asymptotics\nfor large activation energy and slow rate of energy release. While the first\norder solution was found unconditionally unstable, the second order evolution\nequation predicted both stable and unstable solutions. The neutral stability\nboundary was found analytically, given by $\\chi=4$, where $\\chi$ is the product\nof activation energy and the ratio of induction to reaction time. This\nreproduces accurately what has been previously established for the reactive\nEuler equations and verified experimentally. The evolution equation also\ncaptures stable limit cycle oscillations in the unstable regime and offers\nunique insight into the instability mechanism. The mechanism amplifying the\nperturbations lies within the induction zone, where the Arrhenius-type rate\nequation provides a large change in induction times for small perturbations.\nThe mechanism attenuating the perturbations arises from acoustic effects, which\ndelays the amplification of the shock front. The longer the detonation wave,\nthe more time it takes for the amplification from the reaction zone to reach\nthe shock front, creating gradients that counter-act the amplification from the\nflame acceleration. The results agree with direct numerical simulation, as well\nas recovering many similarities with the reactive Euler equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 22:46:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-21"}

The mapping area covers ~1/5 of the whole filament. Our 13CO and\nC18O maps clearly demonstrate that the core formed at the local density maxima\nof the filament, and the internal motions of the filament gas are totally\ngoverned by turbulence with Mach number of ~2. We estimated the scale height of\nthe filament to be H = 0.3 ~ 0.7 pc, yielding the central density of n_c = 700\n~4200 cm^-3. Our analysis adopting an isothermal cylinder model shows that the\nfilament is supported by the turbulent and magnetic pressures against the\nradial and axial collapse due to self-gravity. Since both the dissipation time\nscales of the turbulence and the transverse magnetic fields can be comparable\nto the free-fall time of the filament gas of 10^6 years, we conclude that the\nlocal decay of the supersonic turbulence made the filament gas locally\nunstable, hence making the core collapse. Furthermore, we newly detected a gas\ncondensation with velocity width enhancement to ~0.3 pc south-west of the GF9-2\ncore. The condensation has a radius of ~0.15 pc and an LTE mass of ~5 Msun. Its\ninternal motion is turbulent with Mach number of ~3, suggestive of a\ngravitationally unbound state.

The technique provides 3-D measurements of galaxy clustering and\nmoments of the galaxy luminosity function. Furthermore, the linear portion of\nthe power spectrum can be used to measure the total line emission intensity\nincluding all sources through cosmic time with redshift information naturally\nencoded.

Unlike the\ntraditional local descriptors such as SIFT, ASR inherently encodes local\ninformation of multi-view patches, making it robust to affine distortions while\nmaintaining a high discriminative ability. To this end, PCA is used to\nrepresent affine-warped patches as PCA-patch vectors for its compactness and\nefficiency. Then according to the subspace assumption, which implies that the\nPCA-patch vectors of various affine-warped patches of the same keypoint can be\nrepresented by a low-dimensional linear subspace, the ASR descriptor is\nobtained by using a simple subspace-to-point mapping. Such a linear subspace\nrepresentation could accurately capture the underlying information of a\nkeypoint (local structure) under multiple views without sacrificing its\ndistinctiveness. To accelerate the computation of ASR descriptor, a fast\napproximate algorithm is proposed by moving the most computational part (ie,\nwarp patch under various affine transformations) to an offline training stage.\nExperimental results show that ASR is not only better than the state-of-the-art\ndescriptors under various image transformations, but also performs well without\na dedicated affine invariant detector when dealing with viewpoint changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2014 02:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-21"}

PV can also potentially avoid the energy losses\nthat are normally associated with long-range grid distribution. The increased\npenetration of solar panels, however, has introduced a need for solar energy\nmodels that are capable of producing realistic synthetic data with small error\nmargins. Such models, for instance, can be used to design the appropriate size\nof energy storage devices or to determine the maximum charging rate of a\nPV-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging station. In this regard, this paper\nproposes a stochastic model for solar generation using a Markov chain approach.\nBased on real data, it is first shown that the solar states are\ninter-dependent, and thus suitable for modeling using a Markov model. Then, the\nprobabilities of transition between states are shown to be heterogeneous over\ndifferent time segments. A model is proposed that captures the inter temporal\ndependency of solar irradiance through segmentation of the Markov chain across\ndifferent times of the day. In the studied model, different state transition\nmatrices are constructed for different time segments, which the proposed\nalgorithm then uses to generate the solar states for different times of the\nday. Numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed\nsynthetic generator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2014 03:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-21"}

Beat-to-beat heart\nrate variability can be represented as a network of increments between\nsubsequent $RR$-intervals, which makes possible the visualization of short-term\nheart period fluctuations. A network is constructed of vertices representing\nincrements between subsequent $RR$-intervals, and edges which connect adjacent\n$RR$-increments.

These approaches get data from sensors directly and\nneed corresponding sensor invoking permissions.\n  This paper presents a novel approach (GVS-Attack) to launch permission\nbypassing attacks from a zero permission Android application (VoicEmployer)\nthrough the speaker. The idea of GVS-Attack utilizes an Android system built-in\nvoice assistant module -- Google Voice Search. Through Android Intent\nmechanism, VoicEmployer triggers Google Voice Search to the foreground, and\nthen plays prepared audio files (like \"call number 1234 5678\") in the\nbackground. Google Voice Search can recognize this voice command and execute\ncorresponding operations. With ingenious designs, our GVS-Attack can forge\nSMS/Email, access privacy information, transmit sensitive data and achieve\nremote control without any permission.\n  Also we found a vulnerability of status checking in Google Search app, which\ncan be utilized by GVS-Attack to dial arbitrary numbers even when the phone is\nsecurely locked with password. A prototype of VoicEmployer has been implemented\nto demonstrate the feasibility of GVS-Attack in real world. In theory, nearly\nall Android devices equipped with Google Services Framework can be affected by\nGVS-Attack. This study may inspire application developers and researchers\nrethink that zero permission doesn't mean safety and the speaker can be treated\nas a new attack surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2014 09:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-21"}

We also find differences between the chemistry\nof the SB ring and some regions of the CND; the SB ring is also much colder and\nless dense than the CND. Chemical modelling does not succeed in reproducing all\nthe molecular ratios with one model per region, suggesting the presence of\nmulti-gas phase components. The LTE, RADEX and chemical analyses all indicate\nthat more than one gas-phase component is necessary to uniquely fit all the\navailable molecular ratios within the CND.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2014 10:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Dimensional reduction produces an action for\nmassive spinning particles in odd dimensions. The field equations that emerge\nin a quantization a la Dirac are shown to be equivalent to the Fierz-Pauli\nones.

We also characterize the disk properties of GW Ori by\nmodeling its spectral energy distribution (SED). By comparing our data to the\nsynthetical spectra, we classify GW Ori as a G8 star. Based on the RVs derived\nfrom the spectra, we confirm the previous result as a close companion in GW Ori\nwith a period of ~242 days and an orbital semi-major axis of ~1 AU. The RV\nresiduals after the subtraction of the orbital solution with the equivalent\nwidths of accretion-related emission lines vary with periods of 5-6.7 days\nduring short time intervals, which are caused by the rotational modulation. The\nH$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ line profiles of GW Ori can be decomposed in two\ncentral-peaked emission components and one blue-shifted absorption component.\nThe absorption components are due to a disk wind modulated by the orbital\nmotion of the close companion. Therefore, the systems like GW Ori can be used\nto study the extent of disk winds. We find that the accretion rates of GW Ori\nare rather constant but can occasionally be enhanced by a factor of 2-3. We\nreproduce the SED of GW Ori by using disk models with gaps ~25-55 AU in size. A\nsmall population of tiny dust particles within the gap produces the excess\nemission at near-infrared bands and the strong and sharp silicate feature at 10\n$\\mu$m. The SED of GW Ori exhibits dramatic changes on timescales of ~20 yr in\nthe near-infrared bands, which can be explained as the change in the amount and\ndistribution of small dust grains in the gap. We collect a sample of\nbinary/multiple systems with disks in the literature and find a strong positive\ncorrelation between their gap sizes and separations from the primaries to\ncompanions, which is generally consistent with the prediction from the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2014 11:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}

Here we demonstrate, for the first time, such a giant\noverlap between near-infrared light and gigahertz sound co-localized in a\nsmall-core silicon wire. The wire is supported by a tiny pillar to block the\npath for external phonon leakage, trapping $\\mathbf{10} \\; \\textbf{GHz}$\nphonons in an area below $\\mathbf{0.1 \\;\n\\boldsymbol\\mu}\\textbf{m}^{\\mathbf{2}}$. Since our geometry can be coiled up to\nform a ring cavity, it paves the way for complete fusion between the worlds of\ncavity optomechanics and Brillouin scattering. The result bodes well for the\nrealization of low-footprint optically-pumped lasers/sasers and delay lines on\na densely integrated silicon chip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2014 13:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-03"}

In 1846 Faraday introduced the concept of vibrating rays,\nin which an atom is conceived as having rays that extend to infinity and move\nwith it. According to this point of view, electromagnetic radiative phenomena\ncorrespond to vibration of these rays, which propagate at speed c relative to\nthe rays (and the atom). Although a discussion on this subject might seem to be\nout-of-date, there are many reasons that justified this debate. The first\nreason is based on the fact that the constancy of the speed of light,\nirrespective of the source movement, has not been demonstrated experimentally\nin a conclusive way. In fact, only ballistic emission theories can be discarded\nby the experimental results. The second reason is based on the fact that study\nof radiometric data from spacecrafts indicates the existence of different kinds\nof anomalous Doppler residuals. We will show that these anomalies exhibit a\nsignature of Vibrating Rays Theory. The third reason is related to the time\ndefinition in a rotating frame. According to SRT there is not a unique way to\nassign a time, whereas under VRT no contradictions are present. And finally,\nthat a properly stated Vibrating Rays Theory is compatible with all known\nexperiments on electromagnetism and light propagation. In the present work we\nwill (1) explain how VRT should be interpreted, and why past experiments were\nmisinterpreted, (2) show the characteristics of VRT that are present in\nspacecraft anomalies, (3) give a possible theoretical model (including the\npossible presence of longitudinal waves), and (4) describe results in an\nongoing experiment designed to distinguish between VRT and SRT models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 19:09:50 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 17:39:46 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 18:21:30 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 20:30:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 18:45:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2014 23:52:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 19:05:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 15:39:07 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 14:54:47 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 21:17:45 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 08:23:35 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2019 11:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}

In the case of ideal\nmonitoring these states are pure, and the set of states for a given monitoring\nforms a basis (which is overcomplete in general) for the system.

Moreover, if the aim of the feedback is to maximize the fidelity of\nthe unconditioned system state with a pure state that is one of its conditioned\nstates, then the optimal unravelling for stabilizing the system in this way is\nthat which induces the pointer basis for the conditioned states. We illustrate\nthese results with a model system: quantum Brownian motion.

In the past, this has limited measurements\noften to be only qualitative in nature, blind to velocity magnitudes. In the\npursuit of quantitatively useful results, one has treated the effects of the\nfinite volume as errors that must be corrected by means of ever more\ncomplicated processing techniques. Resulting measurements have limited\nrobustness and require convoluted efforts to understand measurement\nuncertainties.

This is the first plot of this type. We follow\nthe model-independent methodology of Daly and Djorgovski (2004) used for their\nradio-galaxy data. Once the data plot is completed, any model can be applied\nand will display accordingly as described in standard literature. We then\ncompile an extensive data set to z = 1.8 by combining SNe Ia data from SNLS3 of\nConley et al. (2011), High-z SNe data of Riess et al. (2004) and radio-galaxy\ndata of Daly & Djorgovski (2004) to be used to validate the new plot. We first\ndisplay these data on a standard Hubble diagram to confirm the best fit for\nLCDM cosmology and thus validate the joined data set. The scale factor plot is\nthen developed from the data and the LCDM model is again displayed from a\nleast-squares fit. The fit parameters are in agreement with the Hubble diagram\nfit confirming the validity of the new plot. Of special interest is the\ntransition-time of the universe which in the scale factor plot will appear as\nan inflection point in the data set. Noise is more visible on this presentation\nwhich is particularly sensitive to inflection points of any model displayed on\nthe plot unlike on a modulus-z diagram where there are no inflection points and\nthe transition-z is not at all obvious by inspection. We obtain a lower limit\nof z >0.6. It is evident from this presentation that there is a dearth of SNe\ndata in the range, z = 1-2, exactly the range necessary to confirm a LCDM\ntransition-z in the neighborhood of z = 0.76.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 20:24:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Feb 2015 19:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

From the standpoint of learning, dendritic\ncompetition through retrograde messengers is the foundation of conditional\nreflex and grandmother cell coding.
