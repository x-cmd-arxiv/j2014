Burr Proton Therapy Center,\nMassachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. This technique measures the water\nequivalent path length (WEPL) to a diode dosimeter with sub-millimeter\nprecision, using very little dose. It may allow one to use the proton stopping\npoint (otherwise too uncertain) to cut between tissue to be treated and tissue\nto be spared, in cases (such as the prostate) where a diode can be placed in a\ncavity (the rectum) distal to the target.\n  A potential problem is range mixing, where (because of scattering) protons\nmay arrive at a diode with different energy-loss histories. The WEPL reported\nby such a diode is meaningless and must be ignored. We therefore use an array\nof diodes, of which some are likely to be at more favorable locations. In\naddition to the overall analysis of time resolved data, this Note describes in\ndetail how range mixed diodes can be identified by looking at the skewness and\nkurtosis of the time dependent signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 18:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-14"}

The proposed approach differs from existing counterparts by making\nonly weak assumptions on both the change-points structure across series, and\nthe statistical signal distributions. Specifically change-points are not\nassumed to occur at simultaneous time instants across series, and no specific\ndistribution is assumed on the individual signals. It relies on the combination\nof a local robust statistical test acting on individual time segments, with a\nglobal Bayesian framework able to optimize configurations from multiple local\nstatistics (from segments of a unique time series or multiple time series).\nUsing an extensive experimental set-up, our algorithm is shown to perform well\non Gaussian data, with the same results in term of recall and precision as\nclassical approaches, such as the fused lasso and the Bernoulli Gaussian model.\nFurthermore, it outperforms the reference models in the case of non normal data\nwith outliers. The control of the False Discovery Rate by an acceptance level\nis confirmed. In the case of multivariate data, the probabilities that\nsimultaneous change-points are shared by some specific time series are learned.\nWe finally illustrate our algorithm with real datasets from energy monitoring\nand genomic.

Currently, this activity index is\navailable in two main forms: the International Sunspot Number initiated by R.\nWolf in 1849 and the Group Number constructed more recently by Hoyt and\nSchatten (1998a,b). Unfortunately, those two series do not match by various\naspects, inducing confusions and contradictions when used in crucial\ncontemporary studies of the solar dynamo or of the solar forcing on the Earth\nclimate. Recently, new efforts have been undertaken to diagnose and correct\nflaws and biases affecting both sunspot series, in the framework of a series of\ndedicated Sunspot Number Workshops. Here, we present a global overview of our\ncurrent understanding of the sunspot number calibration. While the early part\nof the sunspot record before 1800 is still characterized by large uncertainties\ndue to poorly observed periods, the more recent sunspot numbers are mainly\naffected by three main inhomogeneities: in 1880-1915 for the Group Number and\nin 1947 and 1980-2014 for the Sunspot Number. The newly corrected series\nclearly indicates a progressive decline of solar activity before the onset of\nthe Maunder Minimum, while the slowly rising trend of the activity after the\nMaunder Minimum is strongly reduced, suggesting that by the mid 18th century,\nsolar activity had already returned to the level of those observed in recent\nsolar cycles in the 20th century.

Under the assumption that frame\ncoefficients of images are sparse, several iterative thresholding algorithms\nfor the image inpainting problem have been proposed in the literature. The\noutputs of such iterative algorithms are closely linked to solutions of several\nconvex minimization models using the balanced approach which simultaneously\ncombines the $l_1$-regularization for sparsity of frame coefficients and the\n$l_2$-regularization for smoothness of the solution. Due to the redundancy of a\ntight frame, elements of a tight frame could be highly correlated and\ntherefore, their corresponding frame coefficients of an image are expected to\nclose to each other. This is called the grouping effect in statistics. In this\npaper, we establish the grouping effect property for frame-based convex\nminimization models using the balanced approach. This result on grouping effect\npartially explains the effectiveness of models using the balanced approach for\nseveral image restoration problems.

The masses of\nthe molecular structures vary from 3e5 to 1e7 Mo3 and the CO(2-1) linewidths\nvary from 15 to 65 km/s. Given the large CO(2-1) linewidths, the observed\nstructures are likely giant molecular associations (GMAs) and not individual\nmolecular clouds (GMCs). Only a few of the GMAs are spatially resolved with the\ncycle 0 ALMA beam and the average density of these GMAs yields a GMC volume\nfilling factor of about 15%. The observed masses of the resolved GMAs are\ninsufficient for them to be gravitationally bound, however, the most massive\nGMA does contain a less massive component with a linewidth of 5.5 km/s (typical\nof an individual virialized GMC). We also show that the GMAs cannot be pressure\nconfined by the hot gas. Given the observed CO(2-1) linewidths of the GMAs\n(i.e., the velocity dispersion of the embedded GMCs) they will likely disperse\non a timescale of about 12 Myr, which is less than the central cooling time of\nthe hot gas, so the embedded GMCs within a GMA must condense out of the hot gas\nat the same time and arise from local concentrations of thermally unstable\nparcels of hot gas.

In both models the finite delay time $t_d$ in the\nvoltage response is connected with temporary cooling of quasiparticles due to\nthe suppression of the superconducitng order parameter by current.

The population of WD+MS PCEBs has been simulated by several authors\nin the past and compared with observations. However, most of those predictions\ndid not take the possible contributions to the envelope ejection from\nadditional sources of energy (mostly recombination energy) into account. Here\nwe update existing binary population models of WD+MS PCEBs by assuming that a\nfraction of the recombination energy available within the envelope contributes\nto ejecting the envelope. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of 10^7 MS+MS\nbinaries for 9 different models using standard assumptions for the initial\nprimary mass function, binary separations, and initial-mass-ratio distribution\nand evolved these systems using the publicly available BSE code. Including a\nfraction of recombination energy leads to a clear prediction of a large number\nof long orbital period (>~10 days) systems mostly containing high-mass WDs. The\nfraction of systems with He-core WD primaries increases with the CE efficiency\nand the existence of very low-mass He WDs is only predicted for high values of\nthe CE efficiency (>~0.5). All models predict on average longer orbital periods\nfor PCEBs containing C/O-core WDs than for PCEBs containing He WDs. This effect\nincreases with increasing values of both efficiencies. Longer periods after the\nCE phase are also predicted for systems containing more massive secondary\nstars. The initial-mass-ratio distribution affects the distribution of orbital\nperiods, especially the distribution of secondary star masses. Our simulations,\nin combination with a large and homogeneous observational sample, can provide\nconstraints on the values of the CE efficiencies, as well as on the\ninitial-mass-ratio distribution for MS+MS binary stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 21:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

One approach to mitigate the computational cost is to build a\nsurrogate model, i.e., an approximate mapping from model parameters (input) to\nobservable quantities (output), so the forward simulations can be done quickly.\nAlternatively, if the surrogate is constructed to approximate the inverse\nmapping from model outputs to parameters, the parameter estimates can be\nobtained directly by treating measurements as inputs to this inverse surrogate.\nMoreover, the uncertainties of parameters can be quantified by propagating the\nmeasurement uncertainties in a straightforward Monte Carlo manner. Based on\nthis idea, we proposed a novel surrogate-based approach for parameter\nestimation and uncertainty assessment, i.e., the Inverse Gaussian Process Monte\nCarlo (IGPMC) algorithm. The Gaussian Process (GP) regression is used to\ndirectly approximate the inverse function of the model output-input\nrelationship. For ill-posed problems, i.e., when there exist non-unique sets of\ninput parameters that all produce an identical system output, multiple inverse\nGP systems are constructed and multiple parameter estimates can be obtained\naccordingly.

There have been numerous\nstudies on the planet occurrence rate of single star systems. However, to fully\nunderstand planet formation, the planet occurrence rate in multiple-star\nsystems needs to be addressed. In this work, we {{infer}} the planet occurrence\nrate in multiple-star systems by measuring the stellar multiplicity rate for\nplanet host stars. For a sub-sample of 56 $Kepler$ planet host stars, we use\nadaptive optics (AO) imaging and the radial velocity (RV) technique to search\nfor stellar companions. The combination of these two techniques results in high\nsearch completeness for stellar companions.

The dynamics\nunderlying the formation of both zonal and non-zonal coherent structures is\ninvestigated in this work within the statistical framework of Stochastic\nStructural Stability Theory (S3T). Previous S3T studies have shown that the\nhomogeneous turbulent state undergoes a bifurcation at a critical parameter and\nbecomes inhomogeneous with the emergence of zonal and/or large-scale non-zonal\nflows and that these statistical predictions of S3T are reflected in direct\nnumerical simulations. In this paper, we study the dynamics underlying the S3T\nstatistical instability of the homogeneous state as a function of parameters.\nIt is shown that for weak planetary vorticity gradient, $\\beta$, both zonal\njets and non-zonal large-scale structures form from upgradient momentum fluxes\ndue to shearing of the eddies by the emerging infinitesimal flow. For large\n$\\beta$, the dynamics of the S3T instability differs for zonal and non-zonal\nflows but in both the destabilizing vorticity fluxes decrease with increasing\n$\\beta$. Shearing of the eddies by the mean flow continues to be the mechanism\nfor the emergence of zonal jets while non-zonal large-scale flows emerge from\nresonant and near resonant triad interactions between the large-scale flow and\nthe stochastically forced eddies. The relation between the formation of\nlarge-scale structure through modulational instability and the S3T instability\nof the homogeneous state is also investigated and it is shown that the\nmodulational instability results are subsumed by the S3T results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jul 2014 07:18:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 19:01:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 06:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

To quantify this we study both the\nformation time and lifetime of a magnetic flux rope in a decaying bipolar\nactive region. We apply a magnetic flux transport model to prescribe the\nevolution of the stellar photospheric field, and use this to drive the\nevolution of the coronal magnetic field via a magnetofrictional technique.\nIncreasing the differential rotation (i.e. decreasing the equator-pole lap\ntime) decreases the flux rope formation time. We find that the formation time\nis dependent upon the geometric mean of the lap time and the surface diffusion\ntimescale. In contrast, the lifetime of flux ropes are proportional to the lap\ntime. With this, flux ropes on stars with a differential rotation of more than\neight times the solar value have a lifetime of less than two days. As a\nconsequence, we propose that features such as solar-like quiescent prominences\nmay not be easily observable on such stars, as the lifetimes of the flux ropes\nwhich host the cool plasma are very short. We conclude that such high\ndifferential rotation stars may have very dynamical coronae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jul 2014 14:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-11"}

In this paper, we\nreport the search for high-energy gamma-ray emission from several nearby\nstar-forming and starburst galaxies using the 68 month data obtained with the\nFermi Large Area Telescope. We found a $\\sim5.5\\sigma$ detection of gamma-ray\nemission above 200{\\rm MeV} from a source spatially coincident with the\nlocation of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC~2146.

The gamma-ray\nluminosity suggests that cosmic rays in NGC~2146 convert most of their energy\ninto secondary pions, so NGC~2146 is a \"proton calorimeter\". It is also found\nthat NGC~2146 obeys the quasi-linear scaling relation between the gamma-ray\nluminosity and total infrared luminosity for star-forming galaxies,\nstrengthening the connection between massive star formation and gamma-ray\nemission of star-forming galaxies.

In their context, the Hurst parameter becomes a H\u007folder continuous\nfunction H(?) of the time variable t. Linear Multifractional Stable Motion\n(LMSM) is the most known one of them with heavy-tailed distributions. Generally\nspeaking, global and local sample path roughness of a multifractional process\nare determined by values of its parameter $H(\\cdot)$; therefore, since about\ntwo decades, several authors have been interested in their statistical\nestimation, starting from discrete variations of the process. Because of\ncomplex dependence structures of variations, in order to show consistency of\nestimators one has to face challenging problems. The main goal of our article\nis to introduce, in the setting of the symmetric alpha-stable non-anticipative\nmoving average LMSM, where $\\alpha \\in (1; 2)$, a new strategy for dealing with\nsuch kind of problems. It can also be useful in other contexts. In contrast\nwith previously developed strategies, this new one does not require to look for\nsharp estimates of covariances related to functionals of variations. Roughly\nspeaking, it consists of expressing variations in such a way that they become\nindependent random variables up to negligible remainders. Thanks to it, we\nobtain, an almost surely and $L^p(\\Omega), p\\in(0; 4]$, consistent estimator of\nthe whole function $H(\\cdot)$, which converges, uniformly in t, and even for\nsome H\u007folder norms. Also, we obtain estimates for the rates of convergence.\nSuch kind of strong consistency results in uniform and H\u007folder norms are rather\nunusual in the literature on statistical estimation of functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Jul 2014 14:58:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 12:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-29"}
