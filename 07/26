Comparisons with isochrones\nindicate that the brightest resolved stars in M32 have ages of a few Gyr, and\nare younger on average than AGB stars with the same intrinsic brightness in the\nouter disk of M31. Accounting for stellar variability is shown to be essential\nfor modelling AGB luminosity functions (LFs). Model LFs that assume the\nstar-forming history measured by Monachesi et al. (2012, ApJ, 745, 97) and the\nvariability properties of Galactic AGB stars match both the K and [5.8] LFs of\nM32. Models also suggest that the slope of the [5.8] LF between M_[5.8] = -8.5\nand --10.0 is sensitive to the mix of stellar ages, and a sizeable fraction of\nthe stars in M32 must have an age older than 7 Gyr in order to match the [5.8]\nLF. The structural properties of M32 in the infrared are also investigated. The\neffective radii that are computed from near-infrared and mid-infrared isophotes\nare similar to those measured at visible wavelengths, suggesting that the\nstellar content of M32 is well-mixed. However, isophotes at radii > 16 arcsec\n(> 60 parsecs) in the near and mid-infrared are flatter than those at visible\nwavelengths. The coefficient of the fourth-order cosine term in the fourier\nexpansion of isophotes changes from `boxy' values at r < 16 arcsec to `disky'\nvalues at r > 48 arcsec in [3.6] and [4.5]. The mid-infrared colors near the\ncenter of M32 do not vary systematically with radius, providing evidence of a\nwell-mixed stellar content in this part of the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 16:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We evaluate the effects of contamination from the surrounding\ncore, partially resolving out the disc, optical depth, fixed assumed dust\ntemperatures, inclination, and the dust opacity law. We show that the\ncombination of these effects can lead to disc mass underestimates by up to\nfactors of 2-3 at millimeter wavelengths and up to an order of magnitude or\nlarger at submillimeter wavelengths. The optically thin portions of\nprotostellar discs are generally cooler in the Class I stage than the Class 0\nstage since Class I discs are typically larger and more optically thick, and\nthus more shielded. The observed disc mass distribution closely resembles the\nintrinsic distribution if this effect is taken into account, especially at\nmillimeter wavelengths where optical depth effects are minimized.

The central idea is to apply the diffusion maps algorithm to a\ntraining data set to produce a stochastic matrix whose generator is a discrete\napproximation to the backward Kolmogorov operator of the underlying dynamics.\nThe eigenvectors of this stochastic matrix, which we will refer to as the\ndiffusion coordinates, are discrete approximations to the eigenfunctions of the\nKolmogorov operator and form an orthonormal basis for functions defined on the\ndata set. Using this basis, we consider the projection of three uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) problems (prediction, filtering, and response) into the\ndiffusion coordinates. In these coordinates, the nonlinear prediction and\nresponse problems reduce to solving systems of infinite-dimensional linear\nordinary differential equations. Similarly, the continuous-time nonlinear\nfiltering problem reduces to solving a system of infinite-dimensional linear\nstochastic differential equations. Solving the UQ problems then reduces to\nsolving the corresponding truncated linear systems in finitely many diffusion\ncoordinates. By solving these systems we give a model-free algorithm for UQ on\ngradient flow systems with isotropic diffusion. We numerically verify these\nalgorithms on a 1-dimensional linear gradient flow system where the analytic\nsolutions of the UQ problems are known. We also apply the algorithm to a\nchaotically forced nonlinear gradient flow system which is known to be well\napproximated as a stochastically forced gradient flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 17:07:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 15:16:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Feb 2015 14:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

In the present paper we report our\ninvestigations into these processes via temperature dependent, non-local Hanle\nexperiments. Epitaxial ZnO thin films were deposited on c-axis sapphire\nsubstrates using a pulsed laser deposition technique. Careful structural,\noptical, and electrical characterizations of the films were performed.\nTemperature dependent Hanle measurements were carried out, using an\nall-electrical scheme for spin injection and detection, in a non-local geometry\nover the temperature range of 20 - 300 K. Carrier concentration in these films,\nas determined by Hall effect measurements, was found to be of the order of\n10^19 cm^-3. It was determined that in such a degenerately doped system it is\nessential to use Fermi-Dirac statistics to explain the transport of carriers in\nthe system. From the Hanle data, spin relaxation time in the ZnO films was\ndetermined at different temperatures. Our analysis of the temperature-dependent\nspin relaxation time data suggests that the dominant mechanism of spin\nrelaxation in ZnO films is the Dyakonov-Perel (DP) mechanism modified for the\nwurtzite crystalline structure in which a hexagonal c-axis reflection asymmetry\nis present. As a result of this modification the spin-relaxation rate is\nlinear-in-momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 17:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Among these observations is the weak\ngravitational lensing of galaxies, e.g., cosmic shear that measures the minute\ndistortions of background galaxy images by intervening cosmic structure. Weak\nlensing and cosmic shear promise to be a powerful probe of astrophysics and\ncosmology, constraining models of dark energy, measuring the evolution of\nstructure in the universe, and testing theories of gravity on cosmic scales.\nHowever, the intrinsic alignment of galaxies -- their shape and orientation\nbefore being lensed -- may pose a great challenge to the use of weak\ngravitational lensing as an accurate cosmological probe, and has been\nidentified as one of the primary physical systematic biases in cosmic shear\nstudies. Correlations between this intrinsic alignment and the lensing signal\ncan persist even for large physical separations, and isolating the effect of\nintrinsic alignment from weak lensing is not trivial. A great deal of work in\nthe last two decades has been devoted to understanding and characterizing this\nintrinsic alignment, which is also a direct and complementary probe of\nstructure formation and evolution in its own right.

This was obtained through an explicit\ncomputation of the dispersion curves. Here the main further contribution\nconsists in studying electric susceptibility, from which the spectrum can be\ninferred. We show how susceptibility is obtained by the Green--Kubo methods of\nHamiltonian statistical mechanics, and give for it a concrete expression in\nterms of time--correlation functions. As in the previous paper, here too we\nwork in a completely classical framework, in which the electrodynamic forces\nacting on the charges are all taken into account, both the retarded forces and\nthe radiation reaction ones. So, in order to apply the methods of statistical\nmechanics, the system has to be previously reduced to a Hamiltonian one. This\nis made possible in virtue of two global properties of classical\nelectrodynamics, namely, the Wheeler--Feynman identity and the Ewald\nresummation properties, the proofs of which were already given for ordered\nsystem. The second contribution consists in formulating the theory in a\ncompletely general way, so that in principle it applies also to disordered\nsystems such as glasses, or liquids or gases, provided the two general\nproperties mentioned above continue to hold. A first step in this direction is\nmade here by providing a completely general proof of the Wheeler--Feynman\nidentity, which is shown to be the counterpart of a general causality property\nof classical electrodynamics. Finally it is shown how a line spectrum can\nappear at all in classical systems, as a counterpart of suitable stability\nproperties of the motions, with a broadening due to a coexistence of\nchaoticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 18:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-28"}

Unlike gapless\ngraphene, MoS2 has an intrinsic band gap in the visible which crosses over from\nan indirect to a direct gap when reduced to a single atomic layer. In this\narticle, we report a comprehensive study of fundamental optical properties of\nMoS2 revealed by optical spectroscopy of Raman, photoluminescence, and vacuum\nultraviolet spectroscopic ellipsometry. A band gap of 1.42 eV is determined by\nthe absorption threshold of bulk MoS2 that shifts to 1.83 eV in monolayer MoS2.\nWe extracted the high precision dielectric function up to 9.0 eV which leads to\nthe identification of many unique interband transitions at high symmetry points\nin the MoS2 momentum space. The positions of the A and B excitons in single\nlayers are found to shift upwards in energy compared with those of the bulk\nform and have smaller separation. A very strong optical critical point\npredicted to correspond to a quasi-particle gap is observed at 2.86 eV, which\nis attributed to optical transitions along the parallel bands between the M and\ngama points in the reduced Brillouin zone. The absence of the bulk MoS2\nspin-orbit interaction peak at ~ 3.0 eV in monolayer MoS2 is, as predicted, the\nconsequence of the coalescence of nearby excitons. A higher energy optical\ntransition at 3.98 eV, commonly occurred in bulk semiconductors, is associated\nwith a combination of several critical points.These optical transitions herein\nreported enhance our understanding of monolayer MoS2 as well as of\ntwo-dimensional systems in general, and thus provide informative guidelines for\nMoS2 optical device designs and theoretical considerations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 18:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In these\nconditions, we find superconducting gaps of $s$-wave symmetry, with a slight\nanisotropy induced by the trigonal warping, and, in the case of $n$-doped\ngraphene, an unexpected two-gap structure reminiscent of MgB$_2$. Our\nMigdal-Eliashberg calculations suggest that the observation of\nsuperconductivity at low temperature should be possible for $n$-doped graphene\nat carrier densities exceeding $10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 18:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Modern electric power\ngrids (smart grids) are equipped with smart sensors that allow to gather\nreal-time information regarding the physical status of all the component\nelements belonging to the whole infrastructure (e.g., cables and related\ninsulation, transformers, breakers and so on). In real-world smart grid\nsystems, usually, additional information that are related to the operational\nstatus of the grid itself are collected such as meteorological information.\nDesigning a suitable recognition (discrimination) model of faults in a\nreal-world smart grid system is hence a challenging task. This follows from the\nheterogeneity of the information that actually determine a typical fault\ncondition. The second point is that, for synthesizing a recognition model, in\npractice only the conditions of observed faults are usually meaningful.\nTherefore, a suitable recognition model should be synthesized by making use of\nthe observed fault conditions only.

As a result, the binary orbit\nshrinks faster than predicted in General Relativity, modifying the rate of\ndecay of the orbital period. In spite of this, scalar-tensor theories can pass\nexisting binary pulsar tests, because observed pulsars may not be compact\nenough or sufficiently orbitally bound to activate scalarization. Gravitational\nwaves emitted during the last stages of compact binary inspirals are thus ideal\nprobes of scalarization effects. For the standard projected sensitivity of\nadvanced LIGO, we here show that, if neutron stars are sufficiently compact to\nenter the detector's sensitivity band already scalarized, then gravitational\nwaves could place constraints at least comparable to binary pulsars. If the\nstars dynamically scalarize while inspiraling in band, then constraints are\nstill possible provided the scalarization occurs sufficiently early in the\ninspiral, roughly below an orbital frequency of 50Hz. In performing these\nstudies, we derive an easy-to-calculate data analysis measure, an integrated\nphase difference between a General Relativistic and a modified signal, that\nmaps directly to the Bayes factor so as to determine whether a modified gravity\neffect is detectable.

Because\nthe feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we\ncalibrate them to the z~0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the\ngalaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account.\nThe observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to $\\lesssim 0.2$ dex over the\nfull mass range, $10^8 < M_*/M_\\odot \\lesssim 10^{11}$, a level of agreement\nclose to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for\nhydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of\nlow-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good\nagreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive\nfractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy\nclusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic CIV and OVI. While\nthe mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with\nobservations for $M_* \\gtrsim 10^9 M_\\odot$, they are insufficiently steep at\nlower masses. The gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of\ngalaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a\nhigher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. EAGLE\nconstitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 20:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 14:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In a\nfluid limit, a control producing asymptotic SSC corresponds to an ideal sliding\nmode control that forces the fluid trajectories to a lower-dimensional sliding\nmanifold. Within deterministic dynamical systems theory, it is well known that\nsliding-mode controls can cause the system to chatter back and forth along the\nsliding manifold due to delays in activation of the control. For the prelimit\nstochastic system, chattering implies fluid-scaled fluctuations that are larger\nthan typical stochastic fluctuations. In this paper we show that chattering can\noccur in the fluid limit of a controlled stochastic network when inappropriate\ncontrol parameters are used. The model has two large service pools operating\nunder the fixed-queue-ratio with activation and release thresholds (FQR-ART)\noverload control which we proposed in a recent paper. We now show that, if the\ncontrol parameters are not chosen properly, then delays in activating and\nreleasing the control can cause chattering with large oscillations in the fluid\nlimit. In turn, these fluid-scaled fluctuations lead to severe congestion, even\nwhen the arrival rates are smaller than the potential total service rate in the\nsystem, a phenomenon referred to as congestion collapse. We show that the fluid\nlimit can be a bi-stable switching system possessing a unique nontrivial\nperiodic equilibrium, in addition to a unique stationary point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 20:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}

Even for a\nshort RNA sequence, the space of tertiary conformations is immense; existing\nmethods to identify native-like conformations mostly resort to random sampling\nof conformations to gain computational feasibility. However native\nconformations may not be examined and prediction accuracy may be compromised\ndue to sampling. In particular, the state-of-the-art methods have yet to\ndeliver the desired prediction performance for RNAs of length beyond 50.\n  This paper presents the work to tackle a key step in the RNA tertiary\nstructure prediction problem, the prediction of the nucleotide interactions\nthat constitute the desired tertiary structure. The research is established\nupon a novel graph model, called backbone k-tree, to markably constrain\nnucleotide interaction relationships in RNA tertiary structure. It is shown\nthat the new model makes it possible to efficiently predict the optimal set of\nnucleotide interactions from the query sequence, including the interactions in\nall recently revealed families. Evident by the preliminary results, the new\nmethod can predict with a high accuracy the nucleotide interactions that\nconstitute the tertiary structure of the query sequence, thus providing a\nviable solution towards ab initio prediction of RNA tertiary structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jul 2014 02:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}

This frequency band, lying between the\nelectronically (<1 THz) and optically (>15 THz) accessible spectrum hosts a\nseries of important collective modes and molecular fingerprints which cannot be\nfully accessed by present THz sources. While present high-energy THz sources\nare limited to 0.1-4 THz the accessibility to the entire THz gap with intense\nTHz pulses would substantially broaden THz applications like live cell imaging\nat higher-resolution, cancer diagnosis, resonant and non-resonant control over\nmatter and light, strong-field induced catalytic reactions, formation of\nfield-induced transient states and contact-free detection of explosives.

We generalize the immigration to come from a\nRenewal process; introducing dependence between neighbouring clusters, and\nallowing for over/under dispersion in cluster locations. This complicates\nevaluation of the likelihood since one needs to know which subset of the\nobserved points are immigrants. Two EM algorithms enable estimation here: The\nfirst is an extension of an existing algorithm that treats the entire branching\nstructure - which points are immigrants, and which point is the parent of each\noffspring - as missing data. The second considers only if a point is an\nimmigrant or not as missing data and can be implemented with linear time\ncomplexity. Both algorithms are found to be consistent in simulation studies.\nFurther, we show that misspecifying the immigration process introduces\nsignficant bias into model estimation-- especially the branching ratio, which\nquantifies the strength of self excitation. Thus, this extended model provides\na valuable alternative model in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jul 2014 10:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}

While there are\nmodels that explain Zipf's law in each of them, those explanations are\ntypically domain specific. Recently, methods from statistical physics were used\nto show that a fairly broad class of models does provide a general explanation\nof Zipf's law. This explanation rests on the observation that real world data\nis often generated from underlying causes, known as latent variables. Those\nlatent variables mix together multiple models that do not obey Zipf's law,\ngiving a model that does. Here we extend that work both theoretically and\nempirically. Theoretically, we provide a far simpler and more intuitive\nexplanation of Zipf's law, which at the same time considerably extends the\nclass of models to which this explanation can apply. Furthermore, we also give\nmethods for verifying whether this explanation applies to a particular dataset.\nEmpirically, these advances allowed us extend this explanation to important\nclasses of data, including word frequencies (the first domain in which Zipf's\nlaw was discovered), data with variable sequence length, and multi-neuron\nspiking activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jul 2014 14:47:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 05:08:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 06:13:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2016 14:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

The logic is defined semantically, -- as\nthe set of formulas which are true at special frames with intransitive and\nreflexive time binary relation. The LTK_r -frames are linear chains of clusters\nconnected by a reflexive intransitive relation $R_T$. Elements inside a cluster\nare connected by several equivalence relations imitating the knowledge of\ndifferent agents. We study the decidability problem for formulas and inference\nrules. Decidability for formulas follows from decidability w.r.t. admissible\ninference rules.To study admissibility, we introduce some special constructive\nKripke models useful for description of admissibility of inference rules. With\na special technique of definable valuations we find an algorithm determining\nadmissible inference rules in LTK_r. That is, we show that the logic LTK_r is\ndecidable and decidable with respect to admissibility of inference rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jul 2014 14:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}

In those\nregions, Nafion can be found as an ultra-thin film, coating the catalyst and\nthe catalyst support surfaces. The impact of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic\ncharacter of these surfaces on the structural formation of the films has not\nbeen sufficiently explored yet. Here, we report about Molecular Dynamics\nsimulation investigation of the substrate effects on the ionomer ultra-thin\nfilm morphology at different hydration levels. We use a mean-field-like model\nwe introduced in previous publications for the interaction of the hydrated\nNafion ionomer with a substrate, characterized by a tunable degree of\nhydrophilicity. We show that the affinity of the substrate with water plays a\ncrucial role in the molecular rearrangement of the ionomer film, resulting in\ncompletely different morphologies. Detailed structural description in different\nregions of the film shows evidences of strongly heterogeneous behavior.
