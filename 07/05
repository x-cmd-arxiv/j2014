We show that the crucial\nfacts are, that the range of each update matrix lies in the last two dimensions\nof the Krylov subspaces defined by the conjugate gradient method and that the\nquasi-Newton condition is satisfied. In the framework based on a sufficient\ncondition to obtain mutually conjugate search directions, we show that the\none-parameter Broyden family is complete.\n  A one-to-one correspondence between the Broyden parameter and the non-zero\nscaling of the search direction obtained from the corresponding quasi-Newton\nmethod compared to the one obtained in the conjugate gradient method is\nderived. In addition, we show that the update matrices from the one-parameter\nBroyden family are almost always well-defined on a quadratic problem with\npositive-definite Hessian.

The model gives the momentum redistribution due to turbulence,\ncollisional transport and energy injection. Intrinsic rotation is determined by\nthe balance between the momentum redistribution and the turbulent diffusion and\nconvection. Two different turbulence regimes are considered: turbulence with\ncharacteristic perpendicular lengths of the order of the ion gyroradius,\n$\\rho_i$, and turbulence with characteristic lengths of the order of the\npoloidal gyroradius, $(B/B_p) \\rho_i$. Intrinsic rotation driven by gyroradius\nscale turbulence is mainly due to the effect of neoclassical corrections and of\nfinite orbit widths on turbulent momentum transport, whereas for the intrinsic\nrotation driven by poloidal gyroradius scale turbulence, the slow variation of\nturbulence characteristics in the radial and poloidal directions and the\nturbulent particle acceleration can be become as important as the neoclassical\nand finite orbit width effects. The magnetic drift is shown to be indispensable\nfor the intrinsic rotation driven by the slow variation of turbulence\ncharacteristics and the turbulent particle acceleration. The equations are\nwritten in a form conducive to implementation in a flux tube code, and the\neffect of the radial variation of the turbulence is included in a novel way\nthat does not require a global gyrokinetic formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2014 18:17:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 20:24:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 07:24:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The identification of these values, which are used\nin the description of systems, is sometimes a hard task. In this work the\nidentification of a q-Gaussian distribution from empirical data was done by a\nmeasure of its tail weight using robust statistics. Numerical methods were used\nto generate artificial data, to find out the tail weight -- medcouple, and also\nto adjust the curve between medcouple and the q value. We showed that the\nmedcouple value remains unchanged when the calculation is applied to data which\nhave long memory. A routine was made to calculate the q value and its standard\ndeviation, when applied to empirical data. It is possible to identify a\nq-Gaussian by the proposed methods with higher precision than in the literature\nfor the same data sample, or as precise as found in the literature. However, in\nthis case, it is required a smaller sample of data.

One of the prominent challenges faced by small-cell\nnetworks is the lack of sufficient backhaul capacity to connect small-cell base\nstations (small-BSs) to the core network. We exploit the effective application\nlayer semantics of both spatial and temporal locality to reduce the backhaul\ntraffic. Specifically, small-BSs are equipped with storage facility to cache\ncontents requested by users. As the {\\em cache hit ratio} increases, most of\nthe users' requests can be satisfied locally without incurring traffic over the\nbackhaul. To make informed caching decisions, the mobility patterns of users\nmust be carefully considered as users might frequently migrate from one small\ncell to another. We study the issue of mobility-aware content caching, which is\nformulated into an optimization problem with the objective to maximize the\ncaching utility. As the problem is NP-complete, we develop a polynomial-time\nheuristic solution termed {\\em MobiCacher} with bounded approximation ratio. We\nalso conduct trace-based simulations to evaluate the performance of {\\em\nMobiCacher}, which show that {\\em MobiCacher} yields better caching utility\nthan existing solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2014 19:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-07"}

The libmpdata++ library covers the basic\nsecond-order-accurate formulation of MPDATA, its third-order variant, the\ninfinite-gauge option for variable-sign fields and a flux-corrected transport\nextension to guarantee non-oscillatory solutions. The library is equipped with\na non-symmetric variational elliptic solver for implicit evaluation of pressure\ngradient terms. All solvers offer parallelisation through domain decomposition\nusing shared-memory parallelisation.\n  The paper describes the library programming interface, and serves as a user\nguide. Supported options are illustrated with benchmarks discussed in the\nMPDATA literature. Benchmark descriptions include code snippets as well as\nquantitative representations of simulation results. Examples of applications\ninclude: homogeneous transport in one, two and three dimensions in Cartesian\nand spherical domains; shallow-water system compared with analytical solution\n(originally derived for a 2D case); and a buoyant convection problem in an\nincompressible Boussinesq fluid with interfacial instability. All the examples\nare implemented out of the library tree. Regardless of the differences in the\nproblem dimensionality, right-hand-side terms, boundary conditions and\nparallelisation approach, all the examples use the same unmodified library,\nwhich is a key goal of libmpdata++ design.

Our analysis\ntherefore provides a simple rule for choosing a particularly advantageous\nsystem size when designing a Hofstadter system whose size is controllable, like\na qubit lattice or an optical cavity array. The density operators projected\nonto the flat bands obey exactly the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, like\nfor Landau levels in the continuum in the case of $C=1$, or obey its\nstraightforward generalization in the case of $C>1$. This allows a mapping\nbetween density-density interaction Hamiltonians for particles in the\nHofstatder model and in a continuum Landau level.

The object of the\ngame here is to characterize the TPO, either as an end in itself (research), or\nto examine its potential for information transmittal (communication).

However, there have been several\nattempts on finding well-behaved fragments of first-order temporal logics and\nrelated temporal description logics, mostly either by restricting the available\nquantifier patterns, or considering sub-Boolean languages. Here we analyse\nseemingly `mild' extensions of decidable one-variable fragments with counting\ncapabilities, interpreted in models with constant, decreasing, and expanding\nfirst-order domains. We show that over most classes of linear orders these\nlogics are (sometimes highly) undecidable, even without constant and function\nsymbols, and with the sole temporal operator `eventually'.\n  We establish connections with bimodal logics over 2D product structures\nhaving linear and `difference' (inequality) component relations, and prove our\nresults in this bimodal setting. We show a general result saying that\nsatisfiability over many classes of bimodal models with commuting linear and\ndifference relations is undecidable.

Our\nresults generalise similar lower bounds on bimodal logics over products of two\nlinear relations, and our proof methods are quite different from the proofs of\nthese results.

This\nmethod does not require the rank of each mode to be specified beforehand, and\ncan automatically determine the number of factors in each mode through our\noptimization scheme. By considering the low-rank structure of the observed\ntensor, we analyze the equivalent relationship of the trace norm between a\nlow-rank tensor and its core tensor.

This, together with the availability of new full evolutionary\nwhite dwarf models that are reliable at high luminosities, have opened the\npossibility of testing particle emission in the core of very hot white dwarfs,\nwhere neutrino processes are dominant. We use the available WDLFs from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey and the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey to constrain the value\nof the neutrino magnetic dipole moment ($\\mu_\\nu$). We constructed theoretical\nWDLFs for different values of $\\mu_\\nu$ and performed a $\\chi^2$-test to derive\nconstraints on the value of $\\mu_\\nu$. We also constructed a unified WDLF by\naveraging the SDSS and SSS and estimated the uncertainties by taking into\naccount the differences between the WDLF at each magnitude bin.
