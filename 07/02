This thesis will begin with a Nahm-like\nconstruction for selfdual strings using loop space, the space of loops on\nspacetime. This construction maps solutions of the Basu-Harvey equation, the\nBPS equation arising in the description of multiple M2-branes, to solutions of\na selfdual string equation on loop space. Furthermore, all ingredients of the\nconstruction reduce to those of the ordinary Nahm construction when\ncompactified on a circle with all loops restricted to those wrapping the\ncircle. The rest of this thesis, however, will not involve loop space. We will\nsee a Nahm-like construction for the case of infinitely many selfdual strings,\nsuspended between two M5-branes. This is possible since the limit taken renders\nthe fields describing the M5-branes abelian. This avoids the problem which the\nrest of this thesis focuses on: What fields describe multiple M5-branes? The\nanswer is likely to involve higher gauge theory, a categorification of gauge\ntheory which describes the parallel transport of extended objects. Any theories\nwhich involves 3-algebras, including current M2-brane models and the\nLambert-Papageorgakis M5-brane model, are examples of higher gauge theories.\nRecently, a class of models with N=(1,0) supersymmetry have been found, with\nsignificant overlap with algebraic structures in higher gauge theory. This\noverlap suggests that the full N=(2,0) theory could involve semistrict\n$L_\\infty$-algebras. Finally, we will see some explicit selfdual string\nsolutions, which may fit into these frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 16:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

Changes to cis-regulatory\nelements are widely believed to be the predominant means by which regulatory\nnetworks evolve, yet examples of regulatory network divergence due to\ntranscription factor (TF) variation have also been observed. To systematically\nascertain the extent to which TFs contribute to regulatory divergence, we\nanalyzed the evolution of the largest class of metazoan TFs, Cys2-His2 zinc\nfinger (C2H2-ZF) TFs, across 12 Drosophila species spanning ~45 million years\nof evolution. Remarkably, we uncovered that a significant fraction of all\nC2H2-ZF 1-to-1 orthologs in flies exhibit variations that can affect their\nDNA-binding specificities. In addition to loss and recruitment of C2H2-ZF\ndomains, we found diverging DNA-contacting residues in ~47% of domains shared\nbetween D. melanogaster and the other fly species. These diverging\nDNA-contacting residues, found in ~66% of the D. melanogaster C2H2-ZF genes in\nour analysis and corresponding to ~24% of all annotated D. melanogaster TFs,\nshow evidence of functional constraint: they tend to be conserved across\nphylogenetic clades and evolve slower than other diverging residues. These same\nvariations were rarely found as polymorphisms within a population of D.\nmelanogaster flies, indicating their rapid fixation. The predicted\nspecificities of these dynamic domains gradually change across phylogenetic\ndistances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence.\nFurther, whereas proteins with conserved C2H2-ZF domains are enriched in\ndevelopmental functions, those with varying domains exhibit no functional\nenrichments. Our work suggests that a subset of highly dynamic and largely\nunstudied TFs are a likely source of regulatory variation in Drosophila and\nother metazoans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 16:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-28"}

We assume that the superconducting layers are parallel to the waveguide\naxis. We show that there exist two specific mutually-orthogonal polarizations\nfor waves which, in spite of the nonlinearity, reflect and transmit through the\nsuperconductor \\emph{independently}. The wave of the first polarization causes\na strong shielding current along the crystallographic \\textbf{ab}-plane of the\nsuperconductor.

The wave of the\nother polarization does not contain the electric field component parallel to\nboth the sample surface and the crystallographic \\textbf{ab}-plane, and excites\nmuch weaker shielding currents. Therefore, it partially reflects and partially\ntransmits through the sample.

In doing this, we completely characterize the\nbest possible performance of linear coding schemes, and also prove that linear\ncodes can be strictly suboptimal.

Having completed their tasks and generated\nprofits, task payoffs must be divided among the agents in some reasonable\nmanner. Cooperative games with overlapping coalitions (OCF games) are a recent\nframework proposed by Chalkiadakis et al. (2010), generalizing classic\ncooperative games to the case where agents may belong to more than one\ncoalition. Having formed overlapping coalitions and divided profits, some\nagents may feel dissatisfied with their share of the profits, and would like to\ndeviate from the given outcome. However, deviation in OCF games is a\ncomplicated matter: agents may decide to withdraw only some of their weight\nfrom some of the coalitions they belong to; that is, even after deviation, it\nis possible that agents will still be involved in tasks with non-deviators.\nThis means that the desirability of a deviation, and the stability of formed\ncoalitions, is to a great extent determined by the reaction of non-deviators.\nIn this work, we explore algorithmic aspects of OCF games, focusing on the core\nin OCF games. We study the problem of deciding if the core of an OCF game is\nnot empty, and whether a core payoff division can be found in polynomial time;\nmoreover, we identify conditions that ensure that the problem admits polynomial\ntime algorithms. Finally, we introduce and study a natural class of OCF games,\nLinear Bottleneck Games. Interestingly, we show that such games always have a\nnon-empty core, even assuming a highly lenient reaction to deviations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 22:30:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 15:27:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 14:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-16"}

Emergency response is characterized as a\nprogressive, interactive, and adaptive process that involves parallel\nactivities of processing streaming information and executing response actions.\nThis study develops a dynamic decision support model that adaptively simulates\nthe time-varying emergency environment and tracks changing best health\nprotection response measures at every stage of an emergency in real-time.\nFeedback mechanisms between the contaminated network, emergency managers, and\nconsumers are incorporated in a dynamic simulation model to capture\ntime-varying characteristics of an emergency environment. An\nevolutionary-computation-based dynamic optimization model is developed to\nadaptively identify time-dependant optimal health protection measures during an\nemergency. This dynamic simulation-optimization model treats perceived\ncontaminant source attributes as time-varying parameters to account for\nperceived contamination source updates as more data stream in over time.\nPerformance of the developed dynamic decision support model is analyzed and\ndemonstrated using a mid-size virtual city that resembles the dynamics and\ncomplexity of real-world urban systems.

This paper presents a new algorithm for the problem\nof using network supercomputing to perform a large collection of independent\ntasks, while dealing with undependable processors. The adversary may cause the\nprocessors to return bogus results for tasks with certain probabilities, and\nmay cause a subset $F$ of the initial set of processors $P$ to crash. The\nadversary is constrained in two ways. First, for the set of non-crashed\nprocessors $P-F$, the \\emph{average} probability of a processor returning a\nbogus result is inferior to $\\frac{1}{2}$. Second, the adversary may crash a\nsubset of processors $F$, provided the size of $P-F$ is bounded from below. We\nconsider two models: the first bounds the size of $P-F$ by a fractional\npolynomial, the second bounds this size by a poly-logarithm. Both models yield\nadversaries that are much stronger than previously studied. Our randomized\nsynchronous algorithm is formulated for $n$ processors and $t$ tasks, with\n$n\\le t$, where depending on the number of crashes each live processor is able\nto terminate dynamically with the knowledge that the problem is solved with\nhigh probability.

A challenge for classifiers in the context of\nneural-net training and massive data sets is to minimize the number of\nparameters required to describe each light curve. We show that a simple and\nfast geometric representation that encodes the overall light curve shape,\ntogether with a chi-square parameter to capture higher-order morphology\ninformation results in efficient yet robust light curve classification,\nespecially for eclipsing binaries. Testing the classifier on the ASAS light\ncurve database, we achieve a retrieval rate of 98\\% and a false-positive rate\nof 2\\% for eclipsing binaries.

On the other hand, a weakly interacting massive particle\n(WIMP) has been an attractive dark matter candidate, due to its well-understood\nthermal production mechanism and its connection to physics at the TeV scale. In\nthis paper, we pursue the possibility that the 3.5-keV X-ray arises from a late\ntime decay of a WIMP dark matter into another WIMP dark matter, both of which\nhave the mass of $O(100)$~GeV and whose mass splitting is about 3.5~keV. We\nfocus on the simplest case where there are two Majorana dark matter particles\nand two charged scalars that couple with a standard model matter particle. By\nassuming a hierarchical structure in the couplings of the two dark matter\nparticles and two charged scalars, it is possible to explain the 3.5-keV line\nand realize the WIMP dark matter scenario at the same time. Since the effective\ncoupling of the two different Majorana dark matter particles and one photon\nviolates CP symmetry, the model always contains a new source of CP violation,\nso the model's connection to the physics of electric dipole moments is\ndiscussed. The model's peculiar signatures at the LHC are also studied.

Our analysis focuses on a one-dimensional version of the model\n(i.e. a single two-leg ladder) where we consider two forms of spin-Peierls (SP)\ninstabilities on the legs: columnar dimers (CD) and staggered dimers (SD). We\nparticularly examine the regime of parameters (corresponding to an intermediate\nXXZ anisotropy) where the SP and rung coupling terms are equally relevant. In\nboth the CD and SD cases we find that the effective field theory describing the\nsystem is a self-dual sine-Gordon model, which favors ordering and the opening\nof a gap to excitations. The order parameter, which reflects the interplay\nbetween the SP and rung interactions, represents a crystal of 4-spin plaquettes\non which longitudinal and transverse dimers are in a superposition. Depending\non the SP instability mode these plaquettes are closed or open, however both\ntypes spontaneously break reflection symmetry across the ladder. The closed\nplaquettes are stable, while the open plaquette-order is relatively fragile and\nthe corresponding gap may be tuned to zero under extreme conditions. We further\nfind that a first order transition occurs from the Plaquette order to a valence\nbond crystal (VBC) of dimers on the legs. It is suggestive that in a higher\ndimensional version of this system, this variety of distinct VBC states with\ncomparable energies leads to the formation of domains. Effectively\none-dimensional gapless spinon modes on domain boundaries can possibly account\nfor the experimental observation of a spin-liquid behavior in a physical\nrealization of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2014 06:57:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 15:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

This\ncontribution focuses on upgrades and characterizations carried out since then.\n  The astrometric metrology was extended from the Coud\\'e focus of the\nAuxillary Telescopes to their secondary mirror, in order to reduce the baseline\ninstabilities and improve the astrometric performance. While carrying out this\nextension, it was realized that the polarization retardance of the star\nseparator derotator had a major impact on both the astrometric metrology and\nthe fringe sensors. A local compensation of this retardance and the operation\non a symmetric baseline allowed a new astrometric commissioning. In October\n2013, an improved astrometric performance of 160 {\\mu}'' was demonstrated,\nstill short of the requirements. Instabilities in the astrometric baseline\nstill appear to be the dominating factor.\n  In preparation to a review held in January 2014, a plan was developed to\nfurther improve the astrometric and faint target performance of PRIMA\nAstrometry. On the astrometric aspect, it involved the extension of the\ninternal longitudinal metrology to primary space, the design and implementation\nof an external baseline metrology, and the development of an astrometric\ninternal fringes mode. On the faint target aspect, investigations of the\nperformance of the fringe sensor units and the development of an AO system\n(NAOMI) were in the plan. Following this review, ESO decided to take a proposal\nto the April 2014 STC that PRIMA be cancelled, and that ESO resources be\nconcentrated on ensuring that Gravity and Matisse are a success. This proposal\nwas recommended by the STC in May 2014, and endorsed by ESO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2014 07:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

VOR is a short instrument by the standards\nof the European Spallation Source (ESS), 30.2 m moderator to sample, and\nprovides instantaneous access to a broad dynamic range, 1 - 120 meV within each\nESS period. The short instrument length combined with the long ESS pulse width\nenables a quadratic flux increase, even at longer wavelengths, by relaxing\nenergy resolution from $\\Delta$E/E = 1% up to $\\Delta$E/E = 7%. This is\nimpossible both on a long chopper spectrometer at the ESS and with instruments\nat short pulsed sources. In comparison to current day chopper spectrometers,\nVOR can offer an order of magnitude improvement in flux for equivalent energy\nresolutions, $\\Delta$E/E = 1-3%. Further relaxing the energy resolution enables\nVOR to gain an extra order of magnitude in flux. In addition, VOR has been\noptimised for repetition rate multiplication (RRM) and is therefore able to\nmeasure, in a single ESS period, 6 - 14 incident wavelengths, across a\nwavelength band of 9 \\AA{} with a novel chopper configuration that transmits\nall incident wavelengths with equivalent counting statistics.

In astrophysical\ndisks, magnetorotational instability (MRI) is considered to play an important\nrole by generating turbulence in the disk and contributes to an effective\nangular momentum transport through a turbulent viscosity. Magnetic\nreconnection, on the other hand, also plays an important role on the evolution\nof the disk through a dissipation of a magnetic field enhanced by a dynamo\neffect of MRI. In this study, we developed a hybrid code to calculate an\nevolution of a differentially rotating system. With this code, we first\nconfirmed a linear growth of MRI. We also investigated a behavior of a\nparticular structure of a current sheet, which would exist in the turbulence in\nthe disk. From the calculation of the magnetic reconnection, we found an\nasymmetric structure in the out-of-plane magnetic field during the evolution of\nreconnection, which can be understood by a coupling of the Hall effect and the\ndifferential rotation. We also found a migration of X-point whose direction is\ndetermined only by an initial sign of J_0 \\times \\Omega_0, where J_0 is the\ninitial current density in the neutral sheet and \\Omega_0 is the rotational\nvector of the background Keplerian rotation. Associated with the migration of\nX-point, we also found a significant enhancement of the perpendicular magnetic\nfield compared to an ordinary MRI. MRI-Magnetic reconnection coupling and the\nresulting magnetic field enhancement can be an effective process to sustain a\nstrong turbulence in the accretion disk and to a transport of angular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2014 09:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-03"}

We find that the directional dependence is\nessentially independent of the feed and is dominated by the curvature of the\ndishes reflecting mesh. The developed beam models are used to reduce wide-field\ninstrumental polarisation in 610 MHz observations by subtracting the expected\nresponse from the $uv$-data itself. Furthermore, a new technique for\npolarisation angle calibration is presented that allows for calibration using\nan unpolarised source and therefore can be implemented at arbitrarily low\nobservational frequencies. This technique has the advantage that it calibrates\nthe polarisation angle independently of ionospheric Faraday rotation and source\nvariability. It also removes the need for known polarised sources on the sky -\nwhich are scarce at low frequencies. We use the technique to retrieve the\nRotation Measure of pulsar B1937+21 at 325 MHz, finding it to be consistent\nwith previous independent measurements.

The dynamical evolution of near-parabolic comets strongly depends on\nthe starting values of the orbital elements derived from the positional\nobservations. In addition, when drawing conclusions about the origin of these\nobjects, it is crucial to control the uncertainties of orbital elements at each\nstage of the dynamical evolution.\n  Aims. I apply a completely homogeneous approach to determine the cometary\norbits and their uncertainties. The resulting catalogue is suitable for the\ninvestigation of the origin and future of near-parabolic comets.\n  Methods. First, osculating orbits were determined on the basis of positional\ndata. Second, the dynamical calculations were performed backwards and forwards\nup to 250 au from the Sun to derive original and future barycentric orbits for\neach comet. In the present investigation of dynamical evolution, the numerical\ncalculations for a given object start from the swarm of virtual comets\nconstructed using the previously determined osculating (nominal) orbit. In this\nway, the uncertainties of orbital elements were derived at the end of numerical\ncalculations.\n  Results. Homogeneous sets of orbital elements for osculating, original and\nfuture orbits are given. The catalogue of 119 cometary orbits constitutes about\n70 per cent of all the first class so-called Oort spike comets discovered\nduring the period of 1801-2010 and about 90 per cent of those discovered in\n1951-2010, for which observations were completed at the end of 2013.\nNon-gravitational (NG) orbits are derived for 45 comets, including asymmetric\nNG~solution for six of them.

Starting from the solution for a square cross-section\n(isotropic), they employ numerical continuation in the cross-sectional aspect\nratio in order to approach the solution for a thin strip. Certain smoothly\nvarying configurations are obtained. More recently in 2007, Starostin and van\nder Heijden pointed out that an actual M\\\"obius band \"localizes\" into a nearly\nflat triangular configuration as the ratio of the strip width to center-line\ncircumference is no longer small. Accordingly they return to the developable,\nthin-plate model of Sadowsky and Wunderlich, obtaining such localized shapes.\nIn this work we strike a middle ground between these two approaches. We employ\nthe standard two-director (special) Cosserat model, and we also use the\ncross-sectional aspect ratio as a numerical continuation parameter.\nNonetheless, we are able to capture both the smoothly varying shapes and the\nlocalized, nearly triangular configurations. Our point of departure is that we\ndo not always employ the strength-of-materials formula for the torsional\nstiffness - a standard feature of the Kirchhoff theory. Our key observation\ncomes from the usual Cosserat ansatz in light of developability, suggesting an\nincreasing torsional stiffness ratio (as well as one increasing bending\nstiffness ratio) as the thickness becomes small.

For the problem of using network supercomputing to\nperform a large collection of independent tasks, prior work introduced a\ndecentralized approach and provided randomized synchronous algorithms that\nperform all tasks correctly with high probability, while dealing with\nmisbehaving or crash-prone processors. The main weaknesses of existing\nalgorithms is that they assume either that the \\emph{average} probability of a\nnon-crashed processor returning incorrect results is inferior to $\\frac{1}{2}$,\nor that the probability of returning incorrect results is known to \\emph{each}\nprocessor. Here we present a randomized synchronous distributed algorithm that\ntightly estimates the probability of each processor returning correct results.\nStarting with the set $P$ of $n$ processors, let $F$ be the set of processors\nthat crash. Our algorithm estimates the probability $p_i$ of returning a\ncorrect result for each processor $i \\in P-F$, making the estimates available\nto all these processors. The estimation is based on the $(\\epsilon,\n\\delta)$-approximation, where each estimated probability $\\tilde{p_i}$ of $p_i$\nobeys the bound ${\\sf Pr}[p_i(1-\\epsilon) \\leq \\tilde{p_i} \\leq\np_i(1+\\epsilon)] > 1 - \\delta$, for any constants $\\delta >0$ and $\\epsilon >0$\nchosen by the user.

Our new approach is\nbased on the TreeCol algorithm, which projects matter distributions onto a\nspherical grid to create maps of column densities for each fluid element in the\ncomputational domain. We have improved this algorithm by using the relative gas\nvelocities, to weight the individual matter contributions with the relative\nspectral line overlaps, in order to properly account for the Doppler effect. We\ncompare our new method to the widely used Sobolev approximation, which yields\nan estimate for the column density based on the local velocity gradient and the\nthermal velocity. This approach generally underestimates the photon escape\nprobability, because it neglects the density gradient and the actual shape of\nthe cloud. We present a correction factor for the true line overlap in the\nSobolev approximation and a new method based on local quantities, which fits\nthe exact results reasonably well during the collapse of the cloud, with the\nerror in the cooling rates always being less than 10%. Analytical fitting\nformulae fail at determining the photon escape probability after formation of\nthe first protostar (error of 40%) because they are based on the assumption of\nspherical symmetry and therefore break down once a protostellar accretion disc\nhas formed. Our method yields lower temperatures and hence promotes\nfragmentation for densities above 10^{10}/ccm at a distance of 200AU from the\nfirst protostar. Since the overall accretion rates are hardly affected by the\ncooling implementation, we expect Pop III stars to have lower masses in our\nsimulations, compared to the results of previous simulations that used the\nSobolev approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2014 13:32:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 07:49:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 13:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

This emergent quantity is\nindependent of the density of the traffic lane, and determines an intrinsic\nscale that characterizes the dynamics of localized quasisoliton structures\ngiven by the time derivative of the headways. The intrinsic scale is analogous\nto the \"charge\" of quasisolitons that controls the strength of interaction\nbetween multiple clusters, leading to non-trivial cluster statistics from\nrandom perturbations to initial uniform traffic. The cluster statistics depend\nboth on the charge and the density of the traffic lane; the relationship is\nqualitatively universal for general car-following models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2014 06:23:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 08:54:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 06:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}
