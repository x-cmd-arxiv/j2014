A magnetic phase transition is marked by a sharp anomaly at T_tr\n= 12.2 K in chi(T) measured at low applied fields which is also reflected in\nthe C_p(T) data through a weak anomaly at 12 K. An irreversibility between the\nzero field cooled and field cooled chi(T) data below 12.2 K and a very large\nrelaxation time of M(t) indicates the presence of ferromagnetic correlation.\nThe magnetic part of specific heat shows a broad Schottky-type anomaly near\n40~K due to the crystal electric field (CEF) effect. An extremely small value\nof magnetic entropy below 12 K suggests a CEF-split singlet ground state which\nis confirmed from our analysis of INS data. The INS spectra show two prominent\ninelastic excitations at 8.5 meV and 18.5 meV that could be well accounted by a\nCEF model. The CEF splitting energy between the ground state singlet and the\nfirst excited doublet is found to be 92 K. Our muSR data reveal a possible\nmagnetic ordering below 30 K which is much higher than that found from the\nspecific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This could be due to\nthe presence of short range correlations well above the long range magnetic\nordering or due to the electronic changes induced by muons. The induced moment\nmagnetism in the singlet ground state system PrIrSi3 with such a large\nsplitting energy of 92 K is quite surprising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jul 2014 16:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

We show that SUSY is robust with\nrespect to decoherence and dissipation. In particular, a stationary density\nmatrix at the supersymmetric lines in the parameter space has a degenerate\nsubspace. A dimension of this subspace is given by the Witten index and thus\ntopologically protected. As a consequence of this SUSY, dissipative dynamics at\nthe supersymmetric lines is constrained by an additional conserved quantity\nwhich translates some part of information about an initial state into the\nstationary state subspace.

It is therefore\nnecessary to discuss the measurement of the beryllium ratio in a framework that\nis more general and more realistic than the leaky-box model.\n  In this work we compute the escape time and age distributions of cosmic rays\nin the Galaxy in a model based on diffusion that is much more realistic than\nthe simple leaky-box, but that remains sufficiently simple to have exact\nanalytic solutions. Using the age distributions of the model to interpret the\nmeasurements of the beryllium-10 suppression, one obtains a cosmic ray\nresidence time that is significantly longer (a factor 2 to 4 depending on the\nextension of the cosmic ray halo) than the leaky-box estimate. This revised\nresidence time implies a proportional reduction of the power needed to generate\nthe galactic cosmic rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jul 2014 21:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

In the mildly ill-posed inverse\nsignal-in-white-noise model, we construct a DDM as empirical Bayes posterior\nwith respect to a certain prior, and define its (default) credible set.

Good object proposal generation algorithms\nrequire high object recall rate as well as low computational cost, because\ngenerating object proposals is usually utilized as a preprocessing step. The\nproblem of how to accelerate the object proposal generation and evaluation\nprocess without decreasing recall is thus of great interest. In this paper, we\npropose a new object proposal generation method using two-stage cascade SVMs,\nwhere in the first stage linear filters are learned for predefined quantized\nscales/aspect-ratios independently, and in the second stage a global linear\nclassifier is learned across all the quantized scales/aspect-ratios for\ncalibration, so that all the proposals can be compared properly.

We suggest that dephasing plays an important role in\ndetermining the transport properties of SAM-MJs. We present an approach for\ncalculating the transport properties of SAM-MJs that inherently takes into\naccount in-plane dephasing in the electron motion as it traverses the SAM\nplane. The calculation is based on the non-equilibrium Green's function\nformalism, with a local dynamics approximation that describes incoherent motion\nalong the SAM plane. Our approach describes well the two hallmarks of transport\nthrough SAM-MJs, namely the exponential decay of current with molecular chain\nlength and the reduction of the current per molecule as compared to\nsingle-molecule junctions. Specifically, we show that dephasing leads to an\nexponential decay of the current as a function of molecular length, even for\nresonant tunneling, where the fully coherent calculation shows little or no\nlength-dependence of the current. The dephasing is also shown to lead to a\nsubstantial reduction of the current in a SAM-MJ as compared to the single\nmolecule junction, in a realistic parameter regime, where the coherent\ncalculation shows only a very small reduction of the current. Finally, we\ndiscuss the effect of dephasing on more subtle transport phenomena such as the\nconductance even-odd effect and negative differential resistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2014 06:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

However, the microscopic origination of the leverage and\nanti-leverage effects is still not understood, and how to produce these effects\nin agent-based modeling remains open. On the other hand, in constructing\nmicroscopic models, it is a promising conception to determine model parameters\nfrom empirical data rather than from statistical fitting of the results.\n  Methods: To study the microscopic origination of the return-volatility\ncorrelation in financial systems, we take into account the individual and\ncollective behaviors of investors in real markets, and construct an agent-based\nmodel. The agents are linked with each other and trade in groups, and\nparticularly, two novel microscopic mechanisms, i.e., investors' asymmetric\ntrading and herding in bull and bear markets, are introduced. Further, we\npropose effective methods to determine the key parameters in our model from\nhistorical market data.\n  Results: With the model parameters determined for six representative\nstock-market indices in the world respectively, we obtain the corresponding\nleverage or anti-leverage effect from the simulation, and the effect is in\nagreement with the empirical one on amplitude and duration. At the same time,\nour model produces other features of the real markets, such as the fat-tail\ndistribution of returns and the long-term correlation of volatilities.\n  Conclusions: We reveal that for the leverage and anti-leverage effects, both\nthe investors' asymmetric trading and herding are essential generation\nmechanisms. These two microscopic mechanisms and the methods for the\ndetermination of the key parameters can be applied to other complex systems\nwith similar asymmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2014 09:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

The method for computing the rational\ngenerating functions, when applied to the study of point configurations in\nfinite sets, gives rise to some classical combinatorial results on Bell numbers\nand Stirling numbers of the second kind. When applied to the study of vector\nconfigurations in a finite vector space, it reveals a connection between\ncounting such configurations and Gaussian binomial coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2014 12:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

Benefit from\nthe existence of gap (e.g. Gribov gap) in gauge systems at low energy, the\nfermion fields can be explicitly bosonized by new gauge fields. When chemical\npotential of the gauge systems is introduced, we find that topological terms\n(such as Chern-Simons term in 2+1D) as constraints inevitably emerge at low\nenergy. The fermion sign problem at finite chemical potential and its deep\nconnection to the Chern-Simons theories are discussed. The Wilson's criteria of\nconfinement in pure gauge theories is generalized to finite chemical potential\ncase. The chemical potential dependence of physical quantities at strong\ncoupling are explicitly calculated, including the expectation value of the\nWilson loop, the confining potential and the confined/deconfined transition\ntemperature. The bosonization puts discussions on chiral symmetry breaking and\nconfined/deconfined transition on an equal footing, so it is suitable for the\nstudy of the subtle interplay between them. We find that the chiral symmetry\nbreaking is a necessary (not sufficient) condition for the confinement in 2+1D,\nand argue that the confined/deconfined phases are not characterized by any\nlocal symmetries but distinguished by their non-local topologies. The low\nenergy modes of the strongly coupled gauge systems in a non-symmetry breaking\nphase is also discussed. The results of the paper can be widely applied to real\nstrongly coupled gauge systems, e.g. high-temperature superconductor and\nquantum chromodynamical systems in 2+1 dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2014 13:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

We preliminarily selected two possible scenarios for such a PX, and\nnumerically simulated its effect on the Earth-Saturn range $\\rho(t)$ by varying\nsome of its orbital parameters over a certain time span; then, we compared our\nresults with some existing actual range residuals. By assuming $m_\\textrm{X} =\n1~m_\\textrm{Mars}$ and a circular orbit, such a putative new member of our\nSolar System would nominally perturb $\\rho(t)$ by a few km over $\\Delta t =\n12~\\textrm{yr}~(2004-2016)$. However, the Cassini spaceraft accurately measured\n$\\rho(t)$ to the level of $\\sigma_\\rho\\simeq 100~\\textrm{m}$. Nonetheless, such\na scenario should not be considered as necessarily ruled out since the Cassini\ndata were reduced so far without explicitly modeling any PX. Indeed, a NASA JPL\nteam recently demonstrated that an extra-signature as large as 4 km affecting\nthe Kronian range would be almost completely absorbed in fitting incomplete\ndynamical models, i.e. without PX itself, to such simulated data, thus not\nshowing up in the standard post-fit range residuals. Larger anomalous\nsignatures would instead occur for $m_\\textrm{X} > 1~m_\\textrm{Mars}$. Their\nnominal} amplitude could be as large as $50-150~\\textrm{km}$ for $m_\\textrm{X}\n= 2.4~m_\\oplus$, thus making less plausible their existence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jul 2014 18:37:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 07:54:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 14:35:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2017 13:13:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}

Our contemporary, information-rich\nenvironment is taken to mean not merely the actual physical surroundings of a\nperson but it is also considered in a more abstract sense, to denote cultural,\nsocietal and technological influences. Our modern environment is far from being\nstatic or stable. In fact, it is continually changing in an exponential manner,\nnecessitating constant adaptive responses on behalf of our developmental and\nevolutionary mechanisms. In this paper, I attempt to describe how a continual,\nbalanced and meaningful exposure to a stimulating environment, including\nexposure to information-that-requires-action (but NOT trivial information), has\ndirect or indirect repercussions on epigenetic mechanisms which may then act to\nprolong healthy longevity. Information gained from our environment acts as a\nhormetic stimulus which up-regulates biological responses and feedback loops,\neventually leading to improved repair of age-related damage. The consequence of\nthis biological information-processing mechanism may influence resource\nallocation and redress the imbalance between somatic cell versus germ-line cell\nrepairs. This can eventually have evolutionary consequences resulting in the\ndrastic reduction of age-related disease and degeneration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2014 14:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-24"}
