In CS-MRI,\nthe randomly under-sampled Fourier matrix is used as the measurement matrix and\nthe wavelet transform is usually used as sparsifying transform matrix. However,\nthe incoherence between the randomly under-sampled Fourier matrix and the\nwavelet matrix is not optimal, which can deteriorate the performance of CS-MRI.\nUsing the mathematical result that noiselets are maximally incoherent with\nwavelets, this paper introduces the noiselet unitary bases as the measurement\nmatrix to improve the incoherence and RIP in CS-MRI, and presents a method to\ndesign the pulse sequence for the noiselet encoding. This novel encoding scheme\nis combined with the multichannel compressive sensing (MCS) framework to take\nthe advantage of multichannel data acquisition used in MRI scanners. An\nempirical RIP analysis is presented to compare the multichannel noiselet and\nmultichannel Fourier measurement matrices in MCS. Simulations are presented in\nthe MCS framework to compare the performance of noiselet encoding\nreconstructions and Fourier encoding reconstructions at different acceleration\nfactors. The comparisons indicate that multichannel noiselet measurement matrix\nhas better RIP than that of its Fourier counterpart, and that noiselet encoded\nMCS-MRI outperforms Fourier encoded MCS-MRI in preserving image resolution and\ncan achieve higher acceleration factors. To demonstrate the feasibility of the\nproposed noiselet encoding scheme, two pulse sequences with tailored spatially\nselective RF excitation pulses was designed and implemented on a 3T scanner to\nacquire the data in the noiselet domain from a phantom and a human brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 17:14:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 02:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-21"}

In larger NCQDs, we observe two peaks in the spin\nsignal vs. $E_p$, whereas in smaller NQCDs, only a single peak is observed\nbefore the signal falls to a low, broad plateau at higher energies. We\ncalculate the spin-dependent oscillator strengths of optical transitions using\na simple effective mass model to understand these results. The observed $E_p$\ndependence of the spin pumping efficiency (SPE) arises from the competition\nbetween the heavy hole (hh), light hole (lh) and split-off (so) band\ncontributions to transitions to the conduction band. The two latter\ncontributions lead to an electron spin polarization in the opposite direction\nfrom the former. At lower $E_p$ the transitions are dominated by the hh band,\ngiving rise to the low energy peaks. At higher $E_p$, the increasing\ncontributions from the lh and so bands lead to a reduction in SPE. The\ndifferent number of peaks in larger and smaller NCQDs is attributed to\nsize-dependence of the ordering of the valence band states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 16:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

The models would be useful\nfor the rapid system simulation of signals in communication systems, i.e.\npassive optical networks that employ RSOAs, signal processing using SOAs and\nfor implementing digital back propagation to undo amplifier induced signal\ndistortions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 17:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-09"}

Fully local and certain quantum realizable two-way local\ntripartite correlations always have a quantum realization with tripartite\nbiseparable states if there is no restriction on the local Hilbert-space\ndimensions.

Our approach relies on the fact that many kernel methods\ncan be expressed as convex optimization problems, and we solve the problems by\nmaking two unbiased stochastic approximations to the functional gradient, one\nusing random training points and another using random functions associated with\nthe kernel, and then descending using this noisy functional gradient. We show\nthat a function produced by this procedure after $t$ iterations converges to\nthe optimal function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space in rate $O(1/t)$,\nand achieves a generalization performance of $O(1/\\sqrt{t})$. This doubly\nstochasticity also allows us to avoid keeping the support vectors and to\nimplement the algorithm in a small memory footprint, which is linear in number\nof iterations and independent of data dimension. Our approach can readily scale\nkernel methods up to the regimes which are dominated by neural nets.

A penalty like Total Variation (TV) that exploits the\nnatural 3D structure of the images can increase the spatial coherence of the\nweight map.

We take advantage of publicly available galaxy\ncatalogues obtained from applying a galaxy formation model to the Millennium\nsimulation. In addition to halo mass, we consider the local density of galaxies\nwithin various fixed scales. Comparing our model predictions to observational\ndata (SDSS), we demonstrate that the models are failing to reproduce the\nobserved density dependence of the quiescent galaxy fraction in several\naspects: for most of the stellar mass ranges and densities explored, models\ncannot reproduce the observed similar behaviour of centrals and satellites,\nthey slightly under-estimate the quiescent fraction of centrals and\nsignificantly over-estimate that of satellites. We show that in the models, the\ndensity dependence of the quiescent central galaxies is caused by a fraction of\n\"backsplash\" centrals which have been satellites in the past (and were thus\nsuffering from environmental processes). Turning to satellite galaxies, the\ndensity dependence of their quiescent fractions reflects a dependence on the\ntime spent orbiting within a parent halo of a particular mass, correlating\nstrongly with halo mass and distance from the halo centre. Comparisons with\nobservational estimates suggest relatively long gas consumption time scales of\nroughly 5 Gyr in low mass satellite galaxies. The quenching time scales\ndecrease with increasing satellite stellar mass. Overall, a change in modelling\nboth internal processes (star formation and feedback) and environmental\nprocesses (e.g. making them dependent on dynamical friction time-scales and\npreventing the re-accretion of gas onto backsplash galaxies) is required for\nimproving currently used galaxy formation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 16:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In certain classes of Chern band\ninsulators and quantum Hall phases, it has been previously demonstrated that\nthere are topological Chern-Simons terms such as a Hall viscosity term and a\ngravitational Chern-Simons term for local lattice deformations. The\nChern-Simons terms can induce anyonic statistics for the topological lattice\ndefects and furthermore dress the defects with certain symmetry quantum\nnumbers. On the other hand, the melting transitions of such liquid-crystalline\norders are driven by the condensation of lattice defects. Based on these\nobservations, we show how the topological terms can change the nature of the\nproximate disordered phases of the quantum liquid crystalline phases. We derive\nand study the effective dual field theories for the liquid crystalline phases\nwith the geometric Chern-Simons terms, and carefully examine the symmetry\nquantum numbers and statistics of defects. We show that a crystal may go\nthrough a continuous phase transition into another crystal with the new\ndiscrete translational symmetries because the dislocation, the topological\ndefect in the crystal, carries non-zero crystal momentum due to the Hall\nviscosity term. For the nematic phase, the disclination will condense at the\nphase transition to the isotropic phase, and we show that the isotropic phase\nmay support a deconfined fractionally charged excitation due to the Wen-Zee\nterm, and thus the isotropic phase and the nematic phase have different\nelectromagnetic Hall responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 20:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Jul 2014 17:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Probabilistic graphical models are very useful for\nmining and discovering data insights, but they are not scalable enough to be\nsuitable for big data problems. Bayesian Networks particularly demonstrate this\nlimitation when their data is represented using few random variables while each\nrandom variable has a massive set of values. With hierarchical data - data that\nis arranged in a treelike structure with several levels - one would expect to\nsee hundreds of thousands or millions of values distributed over even just a\nsmall number of levels. When modeling this kind of hierarchical data across\nlarge data sets, Bayesian networks become infeasible for representing the\nprobability distributions for the following reasons: i) Each level represents a\nsingle random variable with hundreds of thousands of values, ii) The number of\nlevels is usually small, so there are also few random variables, and iii) The\nstructure of the network is predefined since the dependency is modeled top-down\nfrom each parent to each of its child nodes, so the network would contain a\nsingle linear path for the random variables from each parent to each child\nnode. In this paper we present a scalable probabilistic graphical model to\novercome these limitations for massive hierarchical data. We believe the\nproposed model will lead to an easily-scalable, more readable, and expressive\nimplementation for problems that require probabilistic-based solutions for\nmassive amounts of hierarchical data. We successfully applied this model to\nsolve two different challenging probabilistic-based problems on massive\nhierarchical data sets for different domains, namely, bioinformatics and latent\nsemantic discovery over search logs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 20:26:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 21:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-21"}

Although the mean-field theory of the\nglass transition -- like that of other statistical systems -- is exact when the\nspatial dimension $d\\rightarrow\\infty$, the evolution of systems properties\nwith $d$ may not be smooth. Finite-dimensional effects could dramatically\nchange what happens in physical dimensions, $d=2,3$. For standard phase\ntransitions finite-dimensional effects are typically captured by\nrenormalization group methods, but for glasses the corrections are much more\nsubtle and only partially understood. Here, we investigate hopping between\nlocalized cages formed by neighboring particles in a model that allows to\ncleanly isolate that effect. By bringing together results from replica theory,\ncavity reconstruction, void percolation, and molecular dynamics, we obtain\ninsights into how hopping induces a breakdown of the Stokes--Einstein relation\nand modifies the mean-field scenario in experimental systems. Although hopping\nis found to supersede the dynamical glass transition, it nonetheless leaves a\nsizable part of the critical regime untouched.

Previously, studies of galactic dynamo have\navoided considering the peripheries of galactic discs because of the very\nlimited (though gradually growing) knowledge about the local properties of the\ninterstellar medium. Here we investigate the possibility that magnetic fields\ncan be generated in the outskirts of discs, taking the Milky Way as an example.\nWe consider a simple evolving galactic dynamo model in the \"no-z\" formulation,\napplicable to peripheral regions of galaxies, for various assumptions about the\nradial and vertical profiles of the ionized gas disc. The magnetic field may\ngrow as galaxies evolve, even in the more remote parts of the galactic disc,\nout to radii of 15 to 30 kpc, becoming substantial after times of about 10 Gyr.\nThis result depends weakly on the adopted distributions of the half thickness\nand surface density of the ionized gas component. The model is robust to\nchanges in the amplitude of the initial field and the position of its maximum\nstrength. The magnetic field in the remote parts of the galactic disc could be\ngenerated in situ from a seed field by local dynamo action. Another possibility\nis field production in the central regions of a galaxy, followed by transport\nto the disc's periphery by the joint action of the dynamo and turbulent\ndiffusivity.

The main\nobjective is to encourage EUs with small distributed energy resources (DERs),\nor with high sensitivity to their inconvenience, to take part in the energy\ntrading via providing incentive to them with relatively higher payment at the\nsame time as reducing the total cost to the energy controller. The proposed\nscheme is modeled through a two-stage Stackelberg game that describes the\nenergy trading between a shared facility authority (SFA) and EUs in a smart\ncommunity. A suitable cost function is proposed for the SFA to leverage the\ngeneration of discriminate pricing according to the inconvenience experienced\nby each EU.

A backward induction technique is used to\nderive a closed form expression for the price function at SPE, and thus the\ndependency of price on an EU's different decision parameters is explained for\nthe studied system.

We assume that the users are concentrated at\ncertain areas in the cell, i.e., they form hotspots. While some of the hotspots\nare assumed to have a small cell in their vicinity, the others are directly\nserved by the macrocell. Due to a relatively small area of each hotspot, the\nusers lying in a particular hotspot appear to be almost co-located to the\nmacrocells, which are typically deployed at some elevation. Assuming large\nnumber of antennas at the macrocell, we exploit this directionality in the\nchannel vectors to obtain spatial blanking, i.e., concentrating transmission\nenergy only in certain directions while creating transmission opportunities for\nthe small cells lying in the other directions. In addition to this inherent\ninterference suppression, we also develop three low-complexity interference\ncoordination strategies: (i) turn off small cells based on the amount of\ncross-tier interference they receive or cause to the scheduled macrocell\nhotspots, (ii) schedule hotspots such that treating interference as noise is\napproximately optimal for the resulting Gaussian interference channel, and\n(iii) offload some of the macrocell hotspots to nearby small cells in order to\nimprove throughput fairness across all hotspots.

The\ninterferometric data for these three systems obtained during the last century\ndetermine the visual orbits of the distant components in the systems.

Assuming the uplink-downlink channel reciprocity provided by\nTDD, both systems are subject to identical channel acquisition overhead during\nthe uplink pilot transmission stage. Further, the available sum power at each\ncluster is fixed and assumed to be equally distributed across the downlink\nbeams in both systems. Building upon the channel distribution functions and\nusing tools from stochastic ordering, this paper shows, however, that from a\nperformance point of view, users experience better quality of service, averaged\nover small-scale fading, under an LS-MIMO system than a network MIMO system.\nNumerical simulations for a multicell network reveal that this conclusion also\nholds true with regularized ZF beamforming scheme. Hence, given the likely\nlower cost of adding excess number of antennas at each BS, LS-MIMO could be the\npreferred route toward interference mitigation in cellular networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 06:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

We take into account the effect of the substrate and assume a well-\ncontrolled number of layers, as it occurs for an opal fabricated by\nLangmuir-Blodgett deposition. The calculations are performed with transfer\nmatrices, and an absorptive component in the effective index is introduced to\naccount for the light scattering. This one-dimensional formalism allows\nquantitative predictions for reflection and transmission, notably as a function\nof the ratio between the irradiation wavelength and the sphere diameter, or as\na function of the incidence angle or of the polarization.

This\neffect is known as single-photon blockade, which is usually analyzed for a\nKerr-type nonlinear cavity parametrically driven by a single-photon process\nassuming single-photon loss mechanisms. We study photon blockade engineering\nvia a squeezed reservoir, i.e., a quantum reservoir, where only two-photon\nabsorption is allowed. Namely, we analyze a lossy nonlinear cavity\nparametrically driven by a two-photon process and allowing two-photon loss\nmechanisms, as described by the master equation derived for a two-photon\nabsorbing reservoir. The nonlinear cavity engineering can be realized by a\nlinear cavity with a tunable two-level system via the Jaynes-Cummings\ninteraction in the dispersive limit. We show that by tuning properly the\nfrequencies of the driving field and the two-level system, the steady state of\nthe cavity field can be the single-photon Fock state or a partially incoherent\nsuperposition of several Fock states with photon numbers, e.g., (0,2), (1,3),\n(0,1,2), or (0,2,4). We observe that an arbitrary initial coherent or\nincoherent superposition of Fock states with an even (odd) number of photons\ncan be changed into a partially incoherent superposition of a few Fock states\nof the same photon-number parity. A general solution for an arbitrary initial\nstate is a weighted mixture of the above two solutions with even and odd photon\nnumbers, where the weights are given by the probabilities of measuring the even\nand odd numbers of photons of the initial cavity field, respectively. Thus, in\ncontrast to the standard photon blockade, we prove that the steady state in the\nengineered photon blockade, can depend on its initial state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 08:13:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Sep 2014 05:39:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-23"}

However, its impact on the chemical evolution of the\nMilky Way still needs to be fully quantified. In this paper, we aim at imposing\nsome constraints on the significance of this phenomenon by considering its\ninfluence on the chemical evolution of the Milky Way thin disc. We do not\ninvestigate the physical mechanisms underlying the migration of stars. Rather,\nwe introduce a simple, heuristic treatment of stellar migration in a detailed\nchemical evolution model for the thin disc of the Milky Way, which already\nincludes radial gas flows and reproduces several observational constraints for\nthe solar vicinity and the whole Galactic disc. When stellar migration is\nimplemented according to the results of chemo-dynamical simulations by Minchev\net. al. (2013) and finite stellar velocities of 1 km s$^{-1}$ are taken into\naccount, the high-metallicity tail of the metallicity distribution function of\nlong-lived thin-disc stars is well reproduced. By exploring the velocity space,\nwe find that the migrating stars must travel with velocities in the range 0.5\n-2 km s$^{-1}$ to properly reproduce the high-metallicity tail of the\nmetallicity distribution. We confirm previous findings by other authors that\nthe observed spread in the age-metallicity relation of solar neighbourhood\nstars can be explained by the presence of stars which originated at different\nGalactocentric distances, and we conclude that the chemical properties of stars\ncurrently observed in the solar vicinity do suggest that stellar migration is\npresent to some extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 09:24:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 16:31:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 10:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The enhancement of effective mass and the induced\nferromagnetic fluctuations play key roles for reentrant superconductivity.\nHowever, the associated change of the Fermi surface, which is often observed at\n(pseudo-) metamagnetic transition, can also be a key ingredient. In order to\nstudy the Fermi surface instability, we performed Hall effect measurements in\nthe ferromagnetic superconductor URhGe. The Hall effect of URhGe is well\nexplained by two contributions, namely by the normal Hall effect and by the\nlarge anomalous Hall effect due to skew scattering. The large change in the\nHall coefficient is observed at low fields between the paramagnetic and\nferromagnetic states for H // c-axis (easy-magnetization axis) in the\northorhombic structure, indicating that the Fermi surface is reconstructed in\nthe ferromagnetic state below the Curie temperature (T_Curie=9.5K). At low\ntemperatures (T << T_Curie), when the field is applied along the b-axis, the\nreentrant superconductivity was observed in both the Hall resistivity and the\nmagnetoresistance below 0.4K. Above 0.4K, a large jump with the first-order\nnature was detected in the Hall resistivity at a spin-reorientation field H_R ~\n12.5T, demonstrating that the marked change of the Fermi surface occurs between\nthe ferromagnetic state and the polarized state above H_R. The results can be\nunderstood by the Lifshitz-type transition, induced by the magnetic field or by\nthe change of the effective magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 09:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The coreshine phenomenon, a scattering process at 3.6\nand 4.5 $\\mu$m that dominates absorption, has revealed its ability to explore\nthe densest parts of clouds. We want to use this effect to constrain the dust\nparameters. The goal is to investigate to what extent grain growth (at constant\ndust mass) inside molecular clouds is able to explain the coreshine\nobservations. We aim to find dust models that can explain a sample of Spitzer\ncoreshine data. We also look at the consistency with near-infrared data we\nobtained for a few clouds. Methods. We selected four regions with a very high\noccurrence of coreshine cases: Taurus-Perseus, Cepheus, Chameleon and\nL183/L134. We built a grid of dust models and investigated the key parameters\nto reproduce the general trend of surface bright- nesses and intensity ratios\nof both coreshine and near-infrared observations with the help of a 3D\nMonte-Carlo radiative transfer code. The grid parameters allow to investigate\nthe effect of coagulation upon spherical grains up to 5 $\\mu$m in size derived\nfrom the DustEm diffuse interstellar medium grains. Fluffiness (porosity or\nfractal degree), ices, and a handful of classical grain size distributions were\nalso tested. We used the near- and mostly mid-infrared intensity ratios as\nstrong discriminants between dust models. Results. The determination of the\nbackground field intensity at each wavelength is a key issue. In particular, an\nespecially strong background field explains why we do not see coreshine in the\nGalactic plane at 3.6 and 4.5 $\\mu$m. For starless cores, where detected, the\nobserved 4.5 $\\mu$m / 3.6 $\\mu$m coreshine intensity ratio is always lower than\n$\\sim$0.5 which is also what we find in the models for the Taurus-Perseus and\nL183 directions. Embedded sources can lead to higher fluxes (up to four times\ngreater than the strongest starless core fluxes) and higher coreshine ratios\n(from 0.5 to 1.1 in our selected sample). Normal interstellar radiation field\nconditions are sufficient to find suitable grain models at all wavelengths for\nstarless cores. The standard interstellar grains are not able to reproduce\nobservations and, due to the multi-wavelength approach, only a few grain types\nmeet the criteria set by the data. Porosity does not affect the flux ratios\nwhile the fractal dimension helps to explain coreshine ratios but does not seem\nable to reproduce near-infrared observations without a mix of other grain\ntypes. Conclusions. Combined near- and mid-infrared wavelengths confirm the\npotential to reveal the nature and size distribution of dust grains. Careful\nassessment of the environmental parameters (interstellar and background fields,\nembedded or nearby reddened sources) is required to validate this new\ndiagnostic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 09:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

The most general\napproach for characterizing the process of decision making, taking into account\nthe conscious-subconscious duality, uses the framework of functional analysis\nin Hilbert spaces, similarly to that used in the quantum theory of\nmeasurements. This does not imply that the brain is a quantum system, but just\nallows for the simplest and most general extension of classical decision\ntheory. The resulting theory of quantum decision making, based on the rules of\nquantum measurements, solves all paradoxes of classical decision making,\nallowing for quantitative predictions that are in excellent agreement with\nexperiments. Finally, we provide a novel application by comparing the\npredictions of QDT with experiments on the prisoner dilemma game. The developed\ntheory can serve as a guide for creating artificial intelligence acting by\nquantum rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 11:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

Also, we discuss briefly the HR diagram of low mass\nstars. On the observed spectrum of M dwarf, the continuum is depressed by the\nnumerous weak lines of H2O and only the depressed continuum or the pseudo-\ncontinuum can be seen. On the theoretical spectrum of M dwarfs, we find that\nthe pseudo-continuum can be evaluated accurately thanks to the recent H2O line\ndatabase. Then quantitative analysis of the spectrum of M dwarf can be done by\nreferring to the pseudo-continua both on the observed and theoretical spectra.\nSince the basic principle of the spectroscopic analysis should be the same\nwhether the true- or pseudo-continuum is referred to, the difficulty related to\nthe continuum in cool stars can in principle be overcome. Then, the numerous CO\nlines can be excellent abundance indicators of carbon, since almost all the\ncarbon atoms are in stable CO molecules whose abundance remains almost\nunchanged for the changes of physical condition in the photosphere and,\nsomewhat unexpectedly, carbon abundances in late-type stars can best be\ndetermined in M dwarfs rather than in solar type stars.

The ASM, PWS, and VisAO camera have undergone final\nsystem tests in the solar test tower at the Arcetri Institute in Florence,\nItaly, reaching Strehls of 37% in i'-band with 400 modes and simulated\nturbulence of 14 cm ro at v-band. We present images and test results of the\nassembled VisAO system, which includes our prototype advanced Atmospheric\nDispersion Corrector (ADC), prototype calcite Wollaston prisms for SDI imaging,\nand a suite of beamsplitters, filters, and other optics. Our advanced ADC\nperforms in the lab as designed and is a 58% improvement over conventional ADC\ndesigns. We also present images and results of our unique Calibration Return\nOptic (CRO) test system and the ASM, which has successfully run in closed- loop\nat 1kHz. The CRO test is a retro reflecting optical test that allows us to test\nthe ASM off-sky in close-loop using an artificial star formed by a fiber\nsource.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 12:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

Based on these\nresults, we estimate the cluster age to be 1.6$^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ Gyr, and derive\na reddening E(B-V)=0.23$\\pm$0.05, and an apparent distance modulus\n$(m-M)_{V}=12.80\\pm0.15$. Its distance to the Galactic centre is 7.6 kpc. With\nthis distance and metallicity, NGC 4337 fits the metallicity gradient for the\ninner Galactic disc fairly well. The age and metallicity we measured make NGC\n4337 a twin of the well-known old open cluster NGC 752. The red clumps of these\ntwo clusters bear an amazing resemblance. But the main sequence of NGC 752 is\nsignificantly more depleted in stars than that of NGC 4337. This would mean\nthat NGC 752 is in a much more advanced dynamical stage, being on the verge of\ndissolving into the general Galactic field. Our results make NGC 4337 an\nextremely interesting object for further studies of stellar evolution in the\ncritical turn-off mass range 1.1-1.4 solar masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 13:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

It is shown\nthat the reference prior for the parameter of interest (the signal intensity)\ncan be well approximated by the widely (ab)used flat prior only when the\nexpected background is very high. On the other hand, a very simple\napproximation (the limiting form of the reference prior for perfect prior\nbackground knowledge) can be safely used over a large portion of the background\nparameters space. The resulting approximate reference posterior is a Gamma\ndensity whose parameters are related to the observed counts. This limiting form\nis simpler than the result obtained with a flat prior, with the additional\nadvantage of representing a much closer approximation to the reference\nposterior in all cases. Hence such limiting prior should be considered a better\ndefault or conventional prior than the uniform prior.

Systematic calculations with the ImQMD model show that the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation found in the symmetric head-on fusion\nreactions at energies just above the Coulomb barrier fades out when the\nincident energy increases. It turns out that this dynamical change with\nincreasing incident energy is caused by a specific behavior of the friction\nparameter which directly depends on the microscopic dynamical process, i.e., on\nhow the collective energy of the relative motion is transferred into the\nintrinsic excitation energy. It is shown microscopically that the energy\ndissipation in the fusion process is governed by two mechanisms: One is caused\nby the nucleon exchanges between two fusing nuclei, and the other is due to a\nrearrangement of nucleons in the intrinsic system. The former mechanism\nmonotonically increases the dissipative energy and shows a weak dependence on\nthe incident energy, while the latter depends on both the relative distance\nbetween two fusing nuclei and the incident energy. It is shown that the latter\nmechanism is responsible for the energy dependence of the fusion potential and\nexplains the fading out of the fluctuation-dissipation relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 15:51:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Nov 2014 02:03:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

This paper\npresents a multidimensional fusion penalty framework to address this question\nwhen the number of conditions is large. If the fusion penalty is encoded by an\n$\\ell_q$-norm, we prove for uniform weights that the path of solutions is a\ntree which is suitable for interpretability. For the $\\ell_1$ and\n$\\ell_\\infty$-norms, the path is piecewise linear and we derive a homotopy\nalgorithm to recover exactly the whole tree structure. For weighted\n$\\ell_1$-fusion penalties, we demonstrate that distance-decreasing weights lead\nto balanced tree structures. For a subclass of these weights that we call\n\"exponentially adaptive\", we derive an $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log(n))$ homotopy\nalgorithm and we prove an asymptotic oracle property. This guarantees that we\nrecover the underlying structure of the data efficiently both from a\nstatistical and a computational point of view.

A fully\nnon-perturbative numerical computation of the time dependence of volume in this\nframework leads to the following results. If the initial state of the universe\nis Einstein-de Sitter with small Gaussian perturbations, then there is no\nacceleration even though the inhomogeneities strongly affect the evolution. A\nuniverse with a positive background curvature can exhibit acceleration, but not\nin conjunction with reasonable values for the Hubble rate. Thus the correct\nvalues for both quantities can be achieved only by introducing a positive\ncosmological constant. Possible loopholes to this conclusion are discussed; in\nparticular, acceleration as an illusion created by peculiarities of light\npropagation in an inhomogeneous universe is still possible. Independently of\nthe cosmological constant question, the present formalism should provide an\nimportant tool for precision cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 12:09:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}
