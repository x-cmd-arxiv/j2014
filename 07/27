Moreover, the uncertainty is a well-studied concept in\nmany mathematical settings, such as those of probability theory, fuzzy set\ntheory, and possibility theory. This fact suggests that an appropriate\nquantification of the uncertainty expressed by the information granule model\ncould be used to define an invariant property, to be exploited in practical\nsituations of information granulation. In this perspective, a procedure of\ninformation granulation is effective if the uncertainty conveyed by the\nsynthesized information granule is in a monotonically increasing relation with\nthe uncertainty of the input data. In this paper, we present a data granulation\nframework that elaborates over the principles of uncertainty introduced by\nKlir. Being the uncertainty a mesoscopic descriptor of systems and data, it is\npossible to apply such principles regardless of the input data type and the\nspecific mathematical setting adopted for the information granules. The\nproposed framework is conceived (i) to offer a guideline for the synthesis of\ninformation granules and (ii) to build a groundwork to compare and\nquantitatively judge over different data granulation procedures. To provide a\nsuitable case study, we introduce a new data granulation technique based on the\nminimum sum of distances, which is designed to generate type-2 fuzzy sets. We\nanalyze the procedure by performing different experiments on two distinct data\ntypes: feature vectors and labeled graphs. Results show that the uncertainty of\nthe input data is suitably conveyed by the generated type-2 fuzzy set models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Jul 2014 16:03:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 14:42:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Jan 2015 18:57:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 13:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

Consequently, they claimed\nthat the two records are characterized by substantially different statistical\nfractional models and rejected the hypothesis that sun influences significantly\nglobal temperatures. I show that: (1) the \"singularity\" or \"pole\" in the\nspectral density function of the global surface temperature at the \"zero\"\nfrequency does not exist - it is a typical misinterpretation that discrete\npower spectra of non-stationary signals can suggest; (2) appropriate continuous\nperiodograms clarify the issue and also show a signature of the 11-year solar\ncycle (amplitude <0.1 K), which since 1850 has an average period of about 10.4\nyear, and of many other natural oscillations; (3) the solar signature in the\nsurface temperature record can be recognized only using specific techniques of\nanalysis that take into account non-linearity and filtering of the multiple\nclimate change contributions; (4) the post 1880-year temperature warming trend\ncannot be compared or studied against the sunspot record and its 11-year cycle,\nbut requires solar proxy models showing short and long scale oscillations plus\nthe contribution of anthropogenic forcings, as done in the literature. Multiple\nevidences suggest that global temperatures and sunspot numbers are quite\nrelated to each other at multiple time scales through complex and non-linear\nprocesses.
