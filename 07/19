However,\nthe constant improvements on the data acquisition hardware, discourages the\ndevelopment of software highly optimized in order to minimize the consumption\nof resources like processor time and read/write memory, etc. In this work, we\npresent a Open Source code called X Interface to RIS (Xitris).

Recently, deep convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) have emerged as clear winners on object classification\nbenchmarks, in part due to training with 1.2M+ labeled classification images.\nUnfortunately, only a small fraction of those labels are available for the\ndetection task. It is much cheaper and easier to collect large quantities of\nimage-level labels from search engines than it is to collect detection data and\nlabel it with precise bounding boxes. In this paper, we propose Large Scale\nDetection through Adaptation (LSDA), an algorithm which learns the difference\nbetween the two tasks and transfers this knowledge to classifiers for\ncategories without bounding box annotated data, turning them into detectors.\nOur method has the potential to enable detection for the tens of thousands of\ncategories that lack bounding box annotations, yet have plenty of\nclassification data.

Our main results can be\nsummarized as follows: i) the slope of the SFR-M correlation is consistent with\nbeing constant, and equal to ~0.8 at least up to z~1.5, while its normalization\nkeeps increasing with redshift; ii) for the first time here we are able to\nexplore the FIR-radio correlation for a mass-selected sample of star-forming\ngalaxies: the correlation does not evolve up to z~4; iii) we confirm that\ngalaxy stellar mass is a robust proxy for UV dust attenuation in star-forming\ngalaxies, with more massive galaxies being more dust attenuated, strikingly we\nfind that this attenuation relation evolves very weakly with redshift, the\namount of dust attenuation increasing by less than 0.3 magnitudes over the\nredshift range [0.5-4] for a fixed stellar mass, as opposed to a tenfold\nincrease of star formation rate; iv) the correlation between dust attenuation\nand the UV spectral slope evolves in redshift, with the median UV spectral\nslope of star-forming galaxies becoming bluer with redshift.

However, all current models of high-level human vision\noperate on hand annotated images in which the objects and actions have been\nassigned semantic tags by a human operator. No current models can account for\nhigh-level visual function directly in terms of low-level visual input (i.e.,\npixels). To overcome this fundamental limitation we sought to develop a new\nclass of models that can predict human brain activity directly from low-level\nvisual input (i.e., pixels). We explored two classes of models drawn from\ncomputer vision and machine learning. The first class of models was based on\nFisher Vectors (FV) and the second was based on Convolutional Neural Networks\n(ConvNets). We find that both classes of models accurately predict brain\nactivity in high-level visual areas, directly from pixels and without the need\nfor any semantic tags or hand annotation of images. This is the first time that\nsuch a mapping has been obtained. The fit models provide a new platform for\nexploring the functional principles of human vision, and they show that modern\nmethods of computer vision and machine learning provide important tools for\ncharacterizing brain function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2014 20:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

These `foci' are thought to be\nembedded within an epileptic network whose functional architecture dynamically\nreorganizes during seizures through synchronous and asynchronous\nneurophysiologic processes. Critical to understanding these dynamics is\nidentifying the synchronous connections that link foci to surrounding tissue\nand investigating how these connections facilitate seizure generation and\ntermination. We use intracranial recordings from neocortical epilepsy patients\nundergoing pre-surgical evaluation to analyze functional connectivity before\nand during seizures. We develop and apply a novel technique to track network\nreconfiguration in time and to parse these reconfiguration dynamics into\ndistinct seizure states, each characterized by unique patterns of network\nconnections that differ in their strength and topography. Our approach suggests\nthat seizures are generated when the synchronous relationships that isolate\nseizure `foci' from the surrounding epileptic network are broken down. As\nseizures progress, foci reappear as isolated subnetworks, marking a shift in\nnetwork state that may aid seizure termination. Collectively, our observations\nhave important theoretical implications for understanding the spatial\ninvolvement of distributed cortical structures in the dynamics of seizure\ngeneration, propagation and termination, and have practical significance in\ndetermining which circuits to modulate with implantable devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Jul 2014 20:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

For low-redshift clusters, the signal is\nstrongly correlated with the local large-scale temperature and polarization\nanisotropies, and the best prospect for detecting the cluster signal is via\ncross-correlation. For high-redshift clusters, the correlation with the local\ntemperature is weaker and the power in the uncorrelated component of the\ncluster polarization can be used to enhance detection. We derive linear and\nquadratic maximum-likelihood estimators for these cases, and forecast\nsignal-to-noise values for the SZ surveys of a Planck-like mission and SPTPol.\nOur estimators represent an optimal `stacking' analysis of the polarization\nfrom clusters. We find that the detectability of the effect is sensitive to the\ncluster gas density distribution, as well as the telescope resolution, cluster\nredshift distribution, and sky coverage. We find that the effect is too small\nto be detected in current and near-future SZ surveys without dedicated\npolarization follow-up, and that an r.m.s. noise on the Stokes parameters of\nroughly 1 uK-arcmin for each cluster field is required for a 2-sigma detection,\nassuming roughly 550 clusters are observed.

These\nestimates can be noisy and suffer from systematic biases because of the\npossible mis-selection of templates and the propagation of the photometric\nredshift uncertainty. We introduce an algorithm, the Direct Empirical\nPhotometric method (DEmP), which can be used to directly estimate these\nquantities using training sets, bypassing photometric redshift determination.\nDEmP also applies two techniques to minimize the effects arising from the\nnon-uniform distribution of training-set galaxy redshifts from a flux-limited\nsample. First, for each input galaxy, fitting is performed using a subset of\nthe training-set galaxies with photometry and colors closest to those of the\ninput galaxy. Second, the training set is artificially resampled to produce a\nflat distribution in redshift, or other properties, e.g., luminosity. To test\nthe performance of DEmP, we use a 4-filter-band mock catalog to examine its\nability to recover redshift, luminosity, stellar mass, and luminosity and\nstellar-mass functions. We also compare the results to those from two publicly\navailable template-fitting methods, finding that the DEmP algorithm outperforms\nboth. We find resampling the training set to have a uniform redshift\ndistribution produces the best results not only in photometric redshift, but\nalso in estimating luminosity and stellar mass.

These binaries\ncontain a compact object (either a black-hole, a neutron-star, or a planet) and\na stellar component. We integrate the full set of tidal equations, which are\nbased on Hut's model for tidal evolution, and we couple them with the angular\nmomentum loss in a stellar wind. Our aim is twofold. Firstly, we wish to\nhighlight some interesting evolutionary outcomes of the coupling. When tides\nare coupled with a non-massive stellar wind, one interesting outcome is that in\ncertain types of binaries, the stellar spin tends to reach a quasi-equilibrium\nstate, where the effect of tides and wind are counteracting each other. When\ntides are coupled with a massive wind, we parametrize the evolution in terms of\nthe decoupling radius, at which the wind decouples from the star. Even for\nsmall decoupling radii this \\emph{wind braking} can drive systems on the main\nsequence to Roche-lobe overflow that otherwise would fail to do so. Our second\naim is to inspect whether simple timescale considerations are a good\ndescription of the evolution of the systems. We find that simple timescale\nconsiderations, which rely on neglecting the coupling between tides and stellar\nwinds, do not accurately represent the true evolution of compact binaries. The\noutcome of the coupled evolution of the rotational and orbital elements can\nstrongly differ from simple timescale considerations, as already pointed out by\nBarker & Ogilvie 2009 in the case of short-period planetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jul 2014 13:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The nonlinear conjugate gradient\n(NCG) method was recently proposed as an alternative to ALS, but the results\nindicated that NCG is usually not faster than ALS. To improve the convergence\nspeed of NCG, we consider a nonlinearly preconditioned nonlinear conjugate\ngradient (PNCG) algorithm for computing the rank-R canonical tensor\ndecomposition. Our approach uses ALS as a nonlinear preconditioner in the NCG\nalgorithm. Alternatively, NCG can be viewed as an acceleration process for ALS.\nWe demonstrate numerically that the convergence acceleration mechanism in PNCG\noften leads to important pay-offs for difficult tensor decomposition problems,\nwith convergence that is significantly faster and more robust than for the\nstand-alone NCG or ALS algorithms. We consider several approaches for\nincorporating the nonlinear preconditioner into the NCG algorithm that have\nbeen described in the literature previously and have met with success in\ncertain application areas. However, it appears that the nonlinearly\npreconditioned NCG approach has received relatively little attention in the\nbroader community and remains underexplored both theoretically and\nexperimentally. Thus, this paper serves several additional functions, by\nproviding in one place a concise overview of several PNCG variants and their\nproperties that have only been described in a few places scattered throughout\nthe literature, by systematically comparing the performance of these PNCG\nvariants for the tensor decomposition problem, and by drawing further attention\nto the usefulness of nonlinearly preconditioned NCG as a general tool. In\naddition, we briefly discuss the convergence of the PNCG algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Jul 2014 13:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

We observed the dSph fields with both a\ncompact array and long baselines. Short spacings led to a synthesized beam of\nabout 1 arcmin and were used for the extended emission search. The\nhigh-resolution data mapped background sources, which in turn were subtracted\nin the short-baseline maps, to reduce their confusion limit. We found no\nsignificant detection of a diffuse radio continuum component. After a detailed\ndiscussion on the modelling of the cosmic-ray (CR) electron distribution and on\nthe dSph magnetic properties, we present bounds on several physical quantities\nrelated to the dSphs, such that the total radio flux, the angular shape of the\nradio emissivity, the equipartition magnetic field, and the injection and\nequilibrium distributions of CR electrons.
