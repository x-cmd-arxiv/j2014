We concentrate on the\nrelation between projected 2D weak-lensing mass and spectroscopically confirmed\nluminosity within 1Mpc, modelled as $M_{WL} \\propto L_{K}^b$, obtaining a power\nlaw slope of $b=0.83^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$ and an intrinsic scatter of\n$\\sigma_{lnM_{WL}|L_{K}}=10^{+8}_{-5}\\%$. Intrinsic scatter of ~10% is a\nconsistent feature of our results regardless of how we modify our approach to\nmeasuring the relationship between mass and light. For example, deprojecting\nthe mass and measuring both quantities within $r_{500}$, that is itself\nobtained from the lensing analysis, yields\n$\\sigma_{lnM_{WL}|L_{K}}=10^{+7}_{-5}\\%$ and $b=0.97^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$.

We exploit this first-order\napproximation to infer existence of piecewise-differentiable impact maps\n(including Poincar\\'{e} maps for periodic orbits), show the flow is locally\nconjugate (via a piecewise-differentiable homeomorphism) to a flowbox, and\nassess the effect of perturbations (both infinitesimal and non-infinitesimal)\non the flow. We use these results to give a sufficient condition for the\nexponential stability of a periodic orbit passing through a point of multiply\nintersecting events, and apply the theory in illustrative examples to\ndemonstrate synchronization in abstract first- and second-order phase\noscillator models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 17:14:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 21:23:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 15:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-23"}

Achieving potential gains with\nlarge-scale antenna arrays in practice hinges on sufficient channel estimation\naccuracy. Much prior work focuses on TDD based networks, relying on reciprocity\nbetween the uplink and downlink channels. However, most currently deployed\ncommercial wireless systems are FDD based, making it difficult to exploit\nchannel reciprocity. In massive MIMO FDD systems, the problem of channel\nestimation becomes even more challenging due to the attendant substantial\ntraining resources and feedback requirements which scale with the number of\nantennas.

Despite the shallow observations, we obtained a\ndirect detection rate of ~29%, comparable with deeper studies.

This paper analyzes some very\nsimple problems: the constructive and destructive interferences of short\nimpulse voltage and current waves along an ideal free-space transmission line.\nWhen voltage waves constructively interfere, the superposition has twice the\nelectrical energy of the individual waveforms because current goes to zero,\nconverting magnetic to electrical energy. When voltage waves destructively\ninterfere, the superposition has no electrical energy because it transforms to\nmagnetic energy. Although the impedance of the individual waves is that of free\nspace, a superposition of waves may exhibit arbitrary impedance. Further,\ninterferences of identical waveforms allow no energy transfer between opposite\nends of a transmission line. The waves appear to recoil elastically one from\nanother. Although alternate interpretations are possible, these appear less\nlikely. Similar phenomenology arises in waves of arbitrary shape and those\npropagating in free space as well.

No clear detections of NH+ are made and the derived upper limits\nare <2*10^-12 and <7*10^-13 in Sgr B2(M) and G10.6-0.4, respectively. The\nsearches are complicated by the fact that the 1013 GHz transition lies only\n-2.5 km/s from a CH2NH line, seen in absorption in Sgr B2(M), and that the\nhyperfine structure components in the 1019 GHz transition are spread over 134\nkm/s.

Their initial and final masses differ significantly\nas a result of mass loss. VMS have strong stellar winds and extremely high\nionising fluxes, which are thought to be critical sources of both mechanical\nand radiative feedback in giant Hii regions. However, how VMS mass-loss\nproperties change during stellar evolution is poorly understood. In the\nframework of the VLT-Flames Tarantula Survey (VFTS), we explore the mass-loss\ntransition region from optically thin O to denser WNh star winds, thereby\ntesting theoretical predictions. To this purpose we select 62 O, Of, Of/WN, and\nWNh stars, an unprecedented sample of stars with the highest masses and\nluminosities known. We perform a spectral analysis of optical VFTS as well as\nnear-infrared VLT/SINFONI data using the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN\nto obtain stellar and wind parameters. For the first time, we observationally\nresolve the transition between optically thin O and optically thick WNh star\nwinds. Our results suggest the existence of a kink between both mass-loss\nregimes, in agreement with recent MC simulations. For the optically thick\nregime, we confirm the steep dependence on the Eddington factor from previous\ntheoretical and observational studies. The transition occurs on the MS near a\nluminosity of 10^6.1Lsun, or a mass of 80...90Msun. Above this limit, we find\nthat - even when accounting for moderate wind clumping (with f = 0.1) - wind\nmass-loss rates are enhanced with respect to standard prescriptions currently\nadopted in stellar evolution calculations. We also show that this results in\nsubstantial helium surface enrichment. Based on our spectroscopic analyses, we\nare able to provide the most accurate ionising fluxes for VMS known to date,\nconfirming the pivotal role of VMS in ionising and shaping their environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-15"}

The fundamental problem is that galaxies' gas accretion and star\nformation rates are too closely coupled in the models: the accretion rate\nlargely drives the star formation rate. Observations point to gas accretion\nrates that outpace star formation at high redshift, resulting in a buildup of\ngas and a delay in star formation until lower redshifts. We present three\nempirical adjustments of standard recipes in a semi-analytic model motivated by\nthree physical scenarios that could cause this decoupling: 1) the mass-loading\nfactors of outflows driven by stellar feedback may have a steeper dependence on\nhalo mass at earlier times, 2) the efficiency of star formation may be lower in\nlow mass halos at high redshift, and 3) gas may not be able to accrete\nefficiently onto the disk in low mass halos at high redshift. These new\nrecipes, once tuned, better reproduce the evolution of $f_\\star \\equiv\nM_\\star/M_{\\rm{H}}$ as a function of halo mass as derived from abundance\nmatching over redshifts $z=0$ to $3$, though they have different effects on\ncold gas fractions, star formation rates, and metallicities. Changes to gas\naccretion and stellar-driven winds are promising, while direct modification of\nthe star formation timescale requires drastic measures that are not physically\nwell-motivated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 20:00:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Dec 2014 17:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We improve upon both approaches by presenting a novel\ndistribution structure with a deterministic and distributed algorithm for\nmaintenance under peer churn; our result is inspired by a recent work proposing\ndeterministic algorithms for rumor spreading in graphs.

We describe the propagation of free\nenergy in phase space using forwards and backwards propagating Hermite modes\nrecently developed for gyrokinetics [Schekochihin et al. (2014)]. The change in\nthe electric field corresponds to the net Hermite flux via a free energy\nevolution equation. In linear Landau damping, decay in the electric field\ncorresponds to forward propagating Hermite modes; in nonlinear damping, the\ninitial decay is followed by a growth phase characterised by the generation of\nbackwards propagating Hermite modes by the nonlinear term. The free energy\ncontent of the backwards propagating modes increases exponentially until\nbalancing that of the forward propagating modes. Thereafter there is no\nsystematic net Hermite flux, so the electric field cannot decay and the\nnonlinearity effectively suppresses Landau damping. These simulations are\nperformed using the fully-spectral 5D gyrokinetics code SpectroGK [Parker et\nal. 2014], modified to solve the 1+1D Vlasov-Poisson system.

To address the two issues in one\nshot, we propose a discriminative Stein kernel, in which an extra parameter\nvector is defined to adjust the eigenvalues of the input SPD matrices. The\noptimal parameter values are sought by optimizing a proxy of classification\nperformance. To show the generality of the proposed method, three different\nkernel learning criteria that are commonly used in the literature are employed\nrespectively as a proxy.

An induced TTV can be observed when a planet\ncrosses a spot and modifies the shape of the transit light curve, even if the\ntime resolution of the data does not allow to detect the crossing event itself.\nWe present an approach that can, in some cases, use the derived TTVs of a\nplanet to distinguish between a prograde and a retrograde planetary motion with\nrespect to the stellar rotation. Assuming a single spot darker than the stellar\ndisc, spot crossing by the planet can induce measured positive (negative) TTV,\nif the crossing occurs in the first (second) half of the transit. On the other\nhand, the motion of the spot towards (away from) the center of the stellar\nvisible disc causes the stellar brightness to decrease (increase). Therefore,\nfor a planet with prograde motion, the induced TTV is positive when the local\nslope of the stellar flux at the time of transit is negative, and vice versa.\nThus, we can expect to observe a negative (positive) correlation between the\nTTVs and the photometric slopes for prograde (retrograde) motion. Using a\nsimplistic analytical approximation, and also the publicly available SOAP-T\ntool to produce light curves of transits with spot-crossing events, we show for\nsome cases how the induced TTVs depend on the local stellar photometric slopes\nat the transit timings. Detecting this correlation in Kepler transiting systems\nwith high enough signal-to-noise ratio can allow us to distinguish between\nprograde and retrograde planetary motions.

Moreover we\nexplore the implications thereof. Above an extrapolated BKT transition\ntemperature, modulated by the thickness $d$, gate voltage $%V_{g}$ or magnetic\nfield $H$, we identify a temperature range where BKT behavior occurs. Its range\nis controlled by the relevant limiting lengths,which are set by the extent of\nthe homogeneous domains or the magnetic field. The extrapolated BKT transition\nlines $T_{c}\\left(d,V_{g},H\\right) $ uncover compatibility with the occurrence\nof a quantum phase transition where $T_{c}\\left( d_{c},V_{gc},H_{c}\\right) =0$.\nHowever, an essential implication of the respective limiting length is that the\nextrapolated phase transition lines $T_{c}\\left( d,V_{g},H\\right) $ are\nunattainable. Consequently, given a finite limiting length, BKT and quantum\nphase transitions do not occur. Nevertheless, BKT and quantum critical behavior\nis observable, controlled by the extent of the relevant limiting length.\nAdditional results and implications include: the magnetic field induced finite\nsize effect generates a flattening out of the sheet resistance in the\n$T\\rightarrow 0$ limit, while in zero field it exhibits a characteristic\ntemperature dependence and vanishes at $T=0$ only.

Both stress-free and finite stress inner boundaries\nare considered. A classical accretion disc spectrum with a stress-free inner\nboundary departs from a Wien spectrum at large $\\nu$, scaling as $\\nu^{2.5}$\n(as opposed to $\\nu^3$) times the usual exponential cut-off. If there is finite\nstress at the inner disc boundary, the maximum disc temperature generally\noccurs at this edge, even at relatively modest values of the stress. In this\ncase, the high frequency spectrum is proportional to $\\nu^2$ times the\nexponential cut-off. If the temperature maximum is a local hot spot, instead of\nan axisymmetric ring, then an interior maximum produces a $\\nu^2$ prefactor\nwhile an edge maximum yields $\\nu^{1.5}$. Because of beaming effects, these\nlatter findings should pertain to a classical relativistic disc. The\nasymptotics are in general robust and independent of the detailed temperature\nprofile, provided only that the liberated free energy of differential rotation\nis dissipated locally, and may prove useful beyond the strict domain of\nclassical disc theory.

The best\nknown algorithms for these problems admit running times of the form $c^W\nn^{O(1)}$, for some constant $c>1$.

Its underlying\nwavefunction ansatz, the matrix product state (MPS), is a low-rank\ndecomposition of the full configuration interaction tensor. The virtual\ndimension of the MPS, the rank of the decomposition, controls the size of the\ncorner of the many-body Hilbert space that can be reached with the ansatz. This\nparameter can be systematically increased until numerical convergence is\nreached. The MPS ansatz naturally captures exponentially decaying correlation\nfunctions. Therefore DMRG works extremely well for noncritical one-dimensional\nsystems. The active orbital spaces in quantum chemistry are however often far\nfrom one-dimensional, and relatively large virtual dimensions are required to\nuse DMRG for ab initio quantum chemistry (QC-DMRG). The QC-DMRG algorithm, its\ncomputational cost, and its properties are discussed. Two important aspects to\nreduce the computational cost are given special attention: the orbital choice\nand ordering, and the exploitation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian.\nWith these considerations, the QC-DMRG algorithm allows to find numerically\nexact solutions in active spaces of up to 40 electrons in 40 orbitals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 11:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-25"}

Moreover, this resulted in network policies having complex\ninterfaces that are not user-friendly and hence resulted in huge and\ncomplicated flow tables on physical switches of networks. This greatly degrades\nthe network performance in many cases. Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) is a\nmodern architecture of networks to overcome issues mentioned above. The idea of\nSDN is to add to the network a controller device that manages all the other\ndevices on the network including physical switches of the network. One of the\nmain tasks of the managing process is switch learning; achieved via programming\nphysical switches of the network by adding or removing rules for\npacket-processing to/from switches, more specifically to/from their flow\ntables. A high-level imperative network programming language, called ImpNet, is\npresented in this paper. ImpNet enables writing efficient, yet simple, and\npowerful programs to run on the controller to control all other network devices\nincluding switches. ImpNet is compositional, simply-structured, expressive, and\nmore importantly imperative.

Therefore, we determine\nthat the high-J CO and HCN transitions are heated by an additional mechanism,\nnamely cosmic ray heating, mechanical heating, or X-ray heating.

When $\\rho=1,2$ and\n$\\infty$ and $q=0$, the problem corresponds to the $k$-median, $k$-mean and the\n$k$-center clustering problems respectively.\n  For every $0 < \\epsilon < 1$, $S\\subset P$ and $\\rho \\ge 1$, we show that the\northogonal projection of $P$ onto a randomly chosen flat of dimension\n$O(((q+1)^2\\log(1/\\epsilon)/\\epsilon^3) \\log n)$ will $\\epsilon$-approximate\n$f_1^q(S,\\rho)$. This result combines the concepts of geometric coresets and\nsubspace embeddings based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. As a consequence,\nan orthogonal projection of $P$ to an $O(((q+1)^2 \\log\n((q+1)/\\epsilon)/\\epsilon^3) \\log n)$ dimensional randomly chosen subspace\n$\\epsilon$-approximates projective clusterings for every $k$ and $\\rho$\nsimultaneously. Note that the dimension of this subspace is independent of the\nnumber of clusters~$k$.\n  Using this dimension reduction result, we obtain new approximation and\nstreaming algorithms for projective clustering problems. For example, given a\nstream of $n$ points, we show how to compute an $\\epsilon$-approximate\nprojective clustering for every $k$ and $\\rho$ simultaneously using only\n$O((n+d)((q+1)^2\\log ((q+1)/\\epsilon))/\\epsilon^3 \\log n)$ space. Compared to\nstandard streaming algorithms with $\\Omega(kd)$ space requirement, our approach\nis a significant improvement when the number of input points and their\ndimensions are of the same order of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 12:34:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 08:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

One of the main limitation of this technique is the effects\nof stellar activity, which up until now, have been taken into account only by\nassessing the effect of non-occulted stellar spots on the estimates of\nplanet-to-star radius ratio. In this paper, we study, for the first time, the\nimpact of the occultation of a stellar spot and plage on the transmission\nspectra of transiting exoplanets. We simulated this effect by generating a\nlarge number of transit light curves for different transiting planets, stellar\nspectral types, and for different wavelengths. Results of our simulations\nindicate that the anomalies inside the transit light curve can lead to a\nsignificant underestimation or overestimation of the planet-to-star radius\nratio as a function of wavelength. At short wavelengths, the effect can reach\nto a difference of up to 10% in the planet-to-star radius ratio, mimicking the\nsignature of light scattering in the planetary atmosphere. Atmospheric\nscattering has been proposed to interpret the increasing slopes of transmission\nspectra toward blue for exoplanets HD 189733b and GJ 3470b. Here we show that\nthese signatures can be alternatively interpreted by the occultation of stellar\nplages. Results also suggest that the best strategy to identify and quantify\nthe effects of stellar activities on the transmission spectrum of a planet is\nto perform several observations during the transit epoch at the same\nwavelength. This will allow for identifying the possible variations in transit\ndepth as a function of time due to stellar activity variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 12:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

With the ever-increasing resolution of modern\nmicroscopes the data set size of the scanned specimen grows steadily. On\ncommodity hardware this size easily exceeds the available main memory and the\neven more limited GPU memory. Common volume rendering techniques require the\nentire data set to be present in the GPU memory. Existing out-of-core rendering\napproaches for large volume data sets either are limited to single-channel\nvolumes, or require a computer cluster, or have long preprocessing times.\nResults: We introduce a ray-casting technique for rendering large volumetric\nmulti-channel microscopy data streams on commodity hardware. The volumetric\ndata is managed at different levels of detail by an octree structure.

We use the high band antennas of LOFAR to image\nthis region and RM-synthesis to unravel structures of polarized emission at\nhigh Galactic latitudes. The brightness temperature of the detected Galactic\nemission is on average 4 K in polarized intensity and covers the range from -10\nto +13rad m^-2 in Faraday depth. The total polarized intensity and polarization\nangle show a wide range of morphological features. We have also used the\nWesterbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) at 350 MHz to image the same\nregion. The LOFAR and WSRT images show a similar complex morphology, at\ncomparable brightness levels, but their spatial correlation is very low. The\nfractional polarization at 150 MHz, expressed as a percentage of the total\nintensity, amounts to 1.5%. There is no indication of diffuse emission in total\nintensity in the interferometric data, in line with results at higher\nfrequencies. The wide frequency range, good angular resolution and good\nsensitivity make LOFAR an exquisite instrument for studying Galactic polarized\nemission at a resolution of 1-2 rad m^-2 in Faraday depth. The different\npolarised patterns observed at 150 MHz and 350 MHz are consistent with\ndifferent source distributions along the line of sight wring in a variety of\nFaraday thin regions of emission. The presence of polarised foregrounds is a\nserious complication for Epoch of Reionization experiments.

The presence of function\nsymbols in the program may render the ground instantiation infinite, and\nfiniteness of models and termination of the evaluation procedure, in the\ngeneral case, are not guaranteed anymore. Since the program termination problem\nis undecidable in the general case, several decidable criteria (called program\ntermination criteria) have been recently proposed. However, current conditions\nare not able to identify even simple programs, whose bottom-up execution always\nterminates. The paper introduces new decidable criteria for checking\ntermination of logic programs with function symbols under bottom-up evaluation,\nby deeply analyzing the program structure. First, we analyze the propagation of\ncomplex terms among arguments by means of the extended version of the argument\ngraph called propagation graph. The resulting criterion, called\nGamma-acyclicity, generalizes most of the decidable criteria proposed so far.\nNext, we study how rules may activate each other and define a more powerful\ncriterion, called safety. This criterion uses the so-called safety function\nable to analyze how rules may activate each other and how the presence of some\narguments in a rule limits its activation. We also study the application of the\nproposed criteria to bound queries and show that the safety criterion is\nwell-suited to identify relevant classes of programs and bound queries.\nFinally, we propose a hierarchy of classes of terminating programs, called\nk-safety, where the k-safe class strictly includes the (k-1)-safe class.

The structure of GPMs is a uniquely good\nmatch for biological problems that range from aligning sequences to modeling\nthe genome-to-phenome relationship. The fundamental questions that GPMs address\ninvolve making decisions based on a complex web of interacting factors.\nUnfortunately, while GPMs ideally fit many questions in biology, they are not\nan easy solution to apply.

This spectrum provides the highest-resolution broad-band spectrum ever\nobtained for Uranus from space, allowing a determination of the disk-averaged\ntemperature and molecule composition to a greater degree of accuracy than ever\nbefore. The temperature profiles derived from the Voyager radio occultation\nexperiments that match these data best are those that assume a high abundance\nof methane in the deep atmosphere, but none of these models provides a\nsatisfactory fit over the full spectral range. This be the result of spatial\ndifferences between global and low-latitudinal regions, changes in time,\nmissing continuum opacity sources such as stratospheric hazes or unknown\ntropospheric constituents, or undiagnosed systematic problems with either the\nradio-occultation or the Spitzer IRS data sets. The spectrum is compatible with\nthe stratospheric temperatures derived from the Voyager ultraviolet\noccultations measurements. Thermospheric temperatures determined from the\nanalysis of the observed H2 quadrupole emission features are colder than those\nderived by Herbert et al. at pressures less than ~1 microbar. Extrapolation of\nthe nominal model spectrum to far-infrared through millimeter wavelengths shows\nthat the spectrum arising solely from H2 collision-induced absorption is too\nwarm to reproduce observations between wavelengths of 0.8 and 3.3 mm. Adding an\nadditional absorber such as H2S provides a reasonable match to the spectrum,\nalthough a unique identification of the responsible absorber is not yet\npossible with available data.

Unlike QM it does not\nrefer to individual operators but rather to ensembles of observables which\nshare the same localization region, as a result it explains the probabilistic\naspects of QFT in terms of the impure KMS nature arising from the local\nrestriction of the pure vacuum. Whereas it played no important role in the\nperturbation theory of low spin particles, it becomes indispensible for\ninteractions which involve higher spin $s\\geq1$ fields, where is leads to the\nreplacement of the operator (BRST) gauge theory setting in Krein space by a new\nformulation in terms of stringlocal fields in Hilbert space. The main purpose\nof this paper is to present new results which lead to a rethinking of important\nissues of the Standard Model concerning massive gauge theories and the Higgs\nmechanism. We place these new findings into the broader context of ongoing\nconceptual changes within QFT which already led to new nonperturbative\nconstructions of models of integrable QFTs. It is also pointed out that modular\nlocalization does not support ideas coming from string theory, as extra\ndimensions and Kaluza-Klein dimensional reductions outside quasiclassical\napproximations. Apart from hologarphic projections on null-surfaces, holograhic\nrelations between QFT in different spacetime dimensions violate the causal\ncompleteness property, this includes in particular the Maldacena conjecture.\nLast not least, modular localization sheds light onto unsolved problems from\nQFT's distant past since it reveals that the Einstein-Jordan conundrum is\nreally an early harbinger of the Unruh effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 14:59:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 05:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-14"}

We perform a detailed physical characterisation of\nnear-Earth asteroid (1620) Geographos, a potential meteor stream source and\nformer spacecraft target, using the same techniques as previously used in\nRozitis et al. (2013) for (1862) Apollo. We use the advanced thermophysical\nmodel (ATPM) on published light-curve, radar, and thermal-infrared observations\nto constrain the thermophysical properties of Geographos. The derived\nproperties are used to make detailed predictions of the Yarkovsky orbital drift\nand YORP rotational acceleration, which are then compared against published\nmeasurements to determine Geographos's bulk density. We find that Geographos\nhas a thermal inertia of 340 +140/-100 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2, a roughness fraction of\n>50%, and a bulk density of 2100 +550/-450 kg m-3 when using the\nlight-curve-derived shape model with the radar-derived maximum equatorial\ndiameter of 5.04 +/- 0.07 km. It is also found that the radar observations had\noverestimated the z-axis in Geographos's shape model because of their\nnear-equatorial view. This results in a poor fit to the thermal-infrared\nobservations if its effective diameter is kept fixed in the model fitting. The\nthermal inertia derived for Geographos is slightly higher than the typical\nvalues for a near-Earth asteroid of its size, and its derived bulk density\nsuggests a rubble-pile interior structure. Large uncertainties in shape model\nz-axes are likely to explain why radar and thermal-infrared observations\nsometimes give inconsistent diameter determinations for other asteroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 15:04:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This can be used to calculate the singlet and\ntriplet survival probabilities and quantum yields of radical recombination\nreactions in the presence of magnetic fields. Our method differs from the early\nsemiclassical theory of Schulten and Wolynes [J. Chem. Phys. 68, 3292 (1978)]\nin allowing each individual nuclear spin to precess around the electron spin,\nrather than assuming that the hyperfine coupling-weighted sum of nuclear spin\nvectors is fixed in space. The downside of removing this assumption is that one\ncan no longer obtain a simple closed-form expression for the electron spin\ncorrelation tensor: our method requires a numerical calculation. However, the\ncomputational effort increases only linearly with the number of nuclear spins,\nrather than exponentially as in an exact quantum mechanical calculation. The\nmethod is therefore applicable to arbitrarily large radicals. Moreover, it\napproaches quantitative agreement with quantum mechanics as the number of\nnuclear spins increases and the environment of the electron spin becomes more\ncomplex, owing to the rapid quantum decoherence in complex systems. Unlike the\nSchulten-Wolynes theory, the present semiclassical theory predicts the correct\nlong-time behaviour of the electron spin correlation tensor, and it therefore\ncorrectly captures the low magnetic field effect in the singlet yield of a\nradical recombination reaction with a slow recombination rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 15:48:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-09"}

Furthermore, if the CutWidth increases\nonly sublinearly with n, a sublinear expected time to extinction is possible\nwith a sublinearly increasing budget $r$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 22:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-10"}

The recently expressed\nopinion that emergence of super-intuition requires transferring quantum\ninformation, which is banned by the impossibility of \"quantum cloning\", is\ncritically considered. It is shown that in fact under QCC the emergence of the\nphenomenon of super-intuition requires not transferring quantum information,\nbut only correlating various fragments of it.

The\nformulation accounts for the realistic variation of the displacements through\nthe thickness, the possible discontinuity in the slope at the interface, and\nthe thickness stretch affecting the transverse deflection. The in-plane and\nrotary inertia terms are also included in the formulation. The first-order high\nMach number approximation to linear potential flow theory is employed for\nevaluating the aerodynamic pressure. The solutions of the complex eigenvalue\nproblem, developed based on Lagrange's equation of motion are obtained using\nthe standard method for finding the eigenvalues. The accuracy of the present\nformulation is demonstrated considering the problems for which solutions are\navailable. A detailed numerical study is carried out to bring out the efficacy\nof the higher-order model over the first-order theory and also to examine the\ninfluence of the volume fraction of the CNT, core-to-face sheet thickness, the\nplate thickness and the aspect ratio, damping and the temperature on the\nflutter boundaries and the associated vibration modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 00:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}
