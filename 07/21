In this work, we consider a generic model for a\nsaddle-node bifurcation on a limit cycle representative for neural excitability\ntype I. We obtain chimera states with multiple coherent regions (clustered\nchimeras/multi-chimeras) depending on the distance from the excitability\nthreshold, the range of nonlocal coupling as well as the coupling strength.

The Value-at-Risk constraint implies that when perceived risk is low,\nleverage is high and vice versa, a phenomenon that has been dubbed pro-cyclical\nleverage. We show that this leads to endogenous irregular oscillations, in\nwhich gradual increases in stock prices and leverage are followed by drastic\nmarket collapses, i.e. a leverage cycle. This phenomenon is studied using\nsimplified models that give a deeper understanding of the dynamics and the\nnature of the feedback loops and instabilities underlying the leverage cycle.\nWe introduce a flexible leverage regulation policy in which it is possible to\ncontinuously tune from pro-cyclical to countercyclical leverage. When the\npolicy is sufficiently countercyclical and bank risk is sufficiently low the\nendogenous oscillation disappears and prices go to a fixed point. While there\nis always a leverage ceiling above which the dynamics are unstable,\ncountercyclical leverage can be used to raise the ceiling. We also study the\nimpact on leverage cycles of direct, temporal control of the bank's riskiness\nvia the bank's required Value-at-Risk quantile. Under such a rule the regulator\nrelaxes the Value-at-Risk quantile following a negative stock price shock and\ntightens it following a positive shock. While such a policy rule can reduce the\namplitude of leverage cycles, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the\nchoice of parameters. Finally, we investigate fixed limits on leverage and show\nhow they can control the leverage cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2014 16:28:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Aug 2014 15:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-19"}

Introduction of an appropriate model for an efficient task\nscheduling technique could derive benefit to the service providers as well as\nclients. In this paper, we have addressed two major challenges which has\nimplications on the performance of the Cloud system. One of the major issues is\nhandling technical aspects of distributing the tasks for targeted gains and the\nsecond issue is related to the handling of the business priority for\nconcurrently resolving business complexity related to cloud consumers. A\ncoordinated scheduling can be achieved by considering the weightage of both\naspects viz. technical requirements and business requirements appropriately. It\ncan be done in such a way that it meets the QoS requirements of technical\ndomain as well as business domain. Along with the technical priority a business\nBp is required in creating a resultant priority which could be given to stages\nof further processing, like task allocation and arbitration schemes. Here we\nconsider a technical priority Tp that is governed by a semi-adaptive scheduling\nalgorithm whereas the resultant priority is derived in which a Business\nPriority Bp layer encapsulates the Technical Priority Tp to achieve the overall\npriority of the incoming tasks. It results in a Hybrid priority creation, which\nis a combination of both technical priority Tp and business priority Bp. By\ntaking into account the business priority of the jobs it is possible to achieve\na higher service level satisfaction for the tasks which are submitted with\ntheir native technical priority. With this approach the waiting time of the\ntasks tends to get reduced and it gives a better service level satisfaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2014 18:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

Objects move in predictable ways and their features and\nidentity remain stable across time and space. How does the brain leverage this\nstructure to make predictions about and learn from the environment? This thesis\ndescribes research centered around a mechanistic description of sensory\nprediction called LeabraTI (TI: Temporal Integration) that explains precisely\nhow predictive processing is accomplished in neocortical microcircuits. The\nfundamental prediction of LeabraTI is that predictions and sensations are\ninterleaved across the same neural tissue at an overall rate of 10 Hz,\ncorresponding to the widely studied alpha rhythm of posterior cortex.\nExperiments described herein tested this prediction by manipulating the\nspatiotemporal properties of three-dimensional object stimuli in a laboratory\nsetting. EEG results indicated that predictions were subserved by ~10 Hz\noscillations that reliably tracked the onset of stimuli and differentiated\nbetween spatially predictable and unpredictable object sequences. There was a\nbehavioral advantage for combined spatial and temporal predictability for\ndiscrimination of unlearned objects, but prolonged study of objects under this\ncombined predictability context impaired discriminability relative to other\nlearning contexts. This counterintuitive pattern of results was accounted for\nby a neural network model that learned three-dimensional viewpoint invariance\nwith LeabraTI's spatiotemporal prediction rule. Synaptic weight scaling from\nprolonged learning built viewpoint invariance, but led to confusion between\nambiguous views of objects, producing slightly lower performance on average.\nOverall, this work advances a biological architecture for sensory prediction\naccompanied by empirical evidence that supports learning of realistic time- and\nspace-varying inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2014 19:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

By casting the\nlearning problem as a local kernel approximation, KBRL provides a way of\ncomputing a decision policy which is statistically consistent and converges to\na unique solution. Unfortunately, the model constructed by KBRL grows with the\nnumber of sample transitions, resulting in a computational cost that precludes\nits application to large-scale or on-line domains. In this paper we introduce\nan algorithm that turns KBRL into a practical reinforcement learning tool.\nKernel-based stochastic factorization (KBSF) builds on a simple idea: when a\ntransition matrix is represented as the product of two stochastic matrices, one\ncan swap the factors of the multiplication to obtain another transition matrix,\npotentially much smaller, which retains some fundamental properties of its\nprecursor. KBSF exploits such an insight to compress the information contained\nin KBRL's model into an approximator of fixed size. This makes it possible to\nbuild an approximation that takes into account both the difficulty of the\nproblem and the associated computational cost. KBSF's computational complexity\nis linear in the number of sample transitions, which is the best one can do\nwithout discarding data. Moreover, the algorithm's simple mechanics allow for a\nfully incremental implementation that makes the amount of memory used\nindependent of the number of sample transitions. The result is a kernel-based\nreinforcement learning algorithm that can be applied to large-scale problems in\nboth off-line and on-line regimes. We derive upper bounds for the distance\nbetween the value functions computed by KBRL and KBSF using the same data.

A {\\it gedankenexperiment} in a modern frame\nis given by a small body, like a compact star or a solar mass black hole,\ncaptured by a supermassive black hole. The mass of the small body itself and\nthe emission of gravitational radiation cause the departure from the geodesic\npath due to the back-action, that is the self-force. For radial fall, as any\nother non-adiabatic motion, the instantaneous identity of the radiated energy\nand the loss of orbital energy cannot be imposed and provide the perturbed\ntrajectory. In the first part of this letter, we present the effects due to the\nself-force computed on the geodesic trajectory in the background field.\nCompared to the latter trajectory, in the Regge-Wheeler, harmonic and all\nothers smoothly related gauges, a far observer concludes that the self-force\npushes inward (not outward) the falling body, with a strength proportional to\nthe mass of the small body for a given large mass; further, the same observer\nnotes an higher value of the maximal coordinate velocity, this value being\nreached earlier on during infall. In the second part of this letter, we\nimplement a self-consistent approach for which the trajectory is iteratively\ncorrected by the self-force, this time computed on osculating geodesics.\nFinally, we compare the motion driven by the self-force without and with\nself-consistent orbital evolution.

We\ninvestigate whether the set of candidate spaces for which the correct program\ncan be synthesized using CEGIS depends on the counterexamples used in inductive\nsynthesis, that is, whether there are good mistakes which would increase the\nsynthesis power. We investigate whether the use of minimal counterexamples\ninstead of arbitrary counterexamples expands the set of candidate spaces of\nprograms for which inductive synthesis can successfully synthesize a correct\nprogram. We consider two kinds of counterexamples: minimal counterexamples and\nhistory bounded counterexamples. The history bounded counterexample used in any\niteration of CEGIS is bounded by the examples used in previous iterations of\ninductive synthesis. We examine the relative change in power of inductive\nsynthesis in both cases. We show that the synthesis technique using minimal\ncounterexamples MinCEGIS has the same synthesis power as CEGIS but the\nsynthesis technique using history bounded counterexamples HCEGIS has different\npower than that of CEGIS, but none dominates the other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 07:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

But for the last type, i.e., an app's non-sensitive and\nnon-shared data, there is a big problem in Android's current storage model\nwhich essentially encourages an app to save its non-sensitive data to shared\npublic storage that can be accessed by other apps. At first glance, it seems no\nproblem to do so, as those data are non-sensitive after all, but it implicitly\nassumes that app developers could correctly identify all sensitive data and\nprevent all possible information leakage from private-but-non-sensitive data.\nIn this paper, we will demonstrate that this is an invalid assumption with a\nthorough survey on information leaks of those apps that had followed Android's\nrecommended storage model for non-sensitive data. Our studies showed that\nhighly sensitive information from billions of users can be easily hacked by\nexploiting the mentioned problematic storage model. Although our empirical\nstudies are based on a limited set of apps, the identified problems are never\nisolated or accidental bugs of those apps being investigated.

The properties of the remnant are well-matched by models for\nstars in a rarely-observed state evolving to higher effective temperatures at\nnearly constant luminosity prior to becoming a very low-mass white dwarf\ncomposed almost entirely of helium, i.e., we confirm that WASP 1628+10B is a\npre-He-WD. WASP 1628+10A appears to be a normal A2V star with a mass of $1.36\n\\pm 0.05 M_{\\odot}$. By fitting models to the spectrum of this star around the\nH$\\gamma$ line we find that it has an effective temperature T$_{\\rm eff,A} =\n7500 \\pm 200$K and a metallicity [Fe/H]$ = -0.3 \\pm 0.3$. The mass of WASP\n1628+10B is only $0.135 \\pm 0.02M_{\\odot}$. The effective temperature of this\npre-He-WD is approximately 9200K. The Ultracam photometry of WASP 1628+10 shows\nvariability at several frequencies around 40 cycles per day, which is typical\nfor $\\delta$ Sct-type pulsations often observed in early A-type stars like WASP\n1628+10A. We also observe frequencies near 114 cycles/day and 129 cycles/day,\nmuch higher than the frequencies normally seen in $\\delta$ Sct stars.\nAdditional photometry through the primary eclipse will be required to confirm\nthat these higher frequencies are due to pulsations in WASP 1628+10B. If\nconfirmed, this would be only the second known example of a pre-He-WD showing\nhigh-frequency pulsations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 08:52:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 09:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-15"}

The velocity of such flows\nis low, and so is their energy density. Large systems are therefore required to\nextract a significant amount of energy. The question of the efficiency of\nenergy harvesting using vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of cables is addressed\nin this paper, through two reference configurations: (i) a long tensioned cable\nwith periodically-distributed harvesters and (ii) a hanging cable with a single\nharvester at its upper extremity. After validation against either direct\nnumerical simulations or experiments, an appropriate reduced-order wake-\noscillator model is used to perform parametric studies of the impact of the\nharvesting parameters on the efficiency. For both configurations, an optimal\nset of parameters is identified and it is shown that the maximum efficiency is\nclose to the value reached with an elastically-mounted rigid cylinder. The\nvariability of the efficiency is studied in light of the fundamental properties\nof each configuration, i.e. body flexibility and gravity-induced spatial\nvariation of the tension. In the periodically-distributed harvester\nconfiguration, it is found that the standing-wave nature of the vibration and\nstructural mode selection play a central role in energy extraction. In\ncontrast, the efficiency of the hanging cable is essentially driven by the\noccurrence of traveling wave vibrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 09:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-02"}

Assuming a reactive interference-limited\nscenario, each transmitter is allowed to select one frequency channel (from a\ncommon pool) together with a power level at each transmission trial; hence, for\nall transmitters, not only the fading gain, but also the number of interfering\ntransmissions and their transmit powers are varying over time. Due to the\nabsence of a central controller and time-varying network characteristics, it is\nhighly inefficient for transmitters to acquire global channel and network\nknowledge. Therefore a reasonable assumption is that transmitters have no\nknowledge of fading gains, interference, and network topology. Each\ntransmitting node selfishly aims at maximizing its average reward (or\nminimizing its average cost), which is a function of the action of that\nspecific transmitter as well as those of all other transmitters. This scenario\nis modeled as a multi-player multi-armed adversarial bandit game, in which\nmultiple players receive an a priori unknown reward with an arbitrarily\ntime-varying distribution by sequentially pulling an arm, selected from a known\nand finite set of arms. Since players do not know the arm with the highest\naverage reward in advance, they attempt to minimize their so-called regret,\ndetermined by the set of players' actions, while attempting to achieve\nequilibrium in some sense. To this end, we design in this paper two joint power\nlevel and channel selection strategies. We prove that the gap between the\naverage reward achieved by our approaches and that based on the best fixed\nstrategy converges to zero asymptotically. Moreover, the empirical joint\nfrequencies of the game converge to the set of correlated equilibria. We\nfurther characterize this set for two special cases of our designed game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 10:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-13"}

We examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dust\nemission as seen by Planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, and\ninvestigate the dust heating mechanism across M31. We find that dust dominating\nthe longer wavelength emission ($\\gtrsim 0.3\\,$mm) is heated by the diffuse\nstellar population (as traced by 3.6$\\,\\mu$m emission), with the dust\ndominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellar\npopulation and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\\,\\mu$m emission). We also\nfit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for individual 5' pixels and quantify\nthe dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these different\nheating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature with\ngalactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as would\nbe expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\\,$K in the nucleus to\n14$\\,$K outside of the 10$\\,$kpc ring.

Firstly, the principles of control volume analysis are enunciated\nand applied to flows of conserved quantities (e.g. mass, momentum, energy)\nthrough a control volume, giving integral (Reynolds transport theorem) and\ndifferential forms of the conservation equations. Several definitions of steady\nstate are discussed. The concept of \"entropy\" is then established using Jaynes'\nmaximum entropy method, both in general and in equilibrium thermodynamics. The\nthermodynamic entropy then gives the \"entropy production\" concept. Equations\nfor the entropy production are then derived for simple, integral and\ninfinitesimal flow systems. Some technical aspects are examined, including\ndiscrete and continuum representations of volume elements, the effect of\nradiation, and the analysis of systems subdivided into compartments. A Reynolds\ndecomposition of the entropy production equation then reveals an \"entropy\nproduction closure problem\" in fluctuating dissipative systems: even at steady\nstate, the entropy production based on mean flow rates and gradients is not\nnecessarily in balance with the outward entropy fluxes based on mean\nquantities. Finally, a direct analysis of an infinitesimal element by Jaynes'\nmaximum entropy method yields a theoretical framework with which to predict the\nsteady state of a flow system. This is cast in terms of a \"minimum flux\npotential\" principle, which reduces, in different circumstances, to maximum or\nminimum entropy production (MaxEP or MinEP) principles. It is hoped that this\nchapter inspires others to attain a deeper understanding and higher technical\nrigour in the calculation and extremisation of the entropy production in flow\nsystems of all types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 12:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

This prominent effect is\naccompanied by a smooth transition from Vogel to Arrhenius temperature\ndependence and by a growing importance of jump events. Consistently, at protein\nsurfaces, deviations from Arrhenius behavior are weak when free water does not\nexist. Furthermore, in nanoporous silica, a dynamic crossover of liquid water\noccurs when a fraction of solid water forms near 225 K and, hence, the liquid\ndynamics changes from bulk-like to interface-dominated.

The statistical analysis of such a\nmulti-dimensional time series of option prices corresponding to $n$ strikes\n(with $n$ large, e.g. $n\\geq 40$) and the same maturity, is a difficult task\ndue to the fact that option prices at any moment in time satisfy non-linear and\nnon-explicit no-arbitrage restrictions. Hence any $n$-dimensional time series\nmodel also has to satisfy these implicit restrictions at each time step, a\ncondition that is impossible to meet since the model innovations can take\narbitrary values. We solve this problem for any $n\\in\\NN$ in the context of\nForeign Exchange (FX) by first encoding the option prices at each time step in\nterms of the parameters of the corresponding risk-neutral measure and then\nperforming the time series analysis in the parameter space. The option price\npredictions are obtained from the predicted risk-neutral measure by effectively\nintegrating it against the corresponding option payoffs. The non-linear\ntransformation between option prices and the risk-neutral parameters applied\nhere is \\textit{not} arbitrary: it is the standard mapping used by market\nmakers in the FX option markets (the SABR parameterisation) and is given\nexplicitly in closed form. Our method is not restricted to the FX asset class\nnor does it depend on the type of parameterisation used. Statistical analysis\nof FX market data illustrates that our arbitrage-free predictions outperform\nthe naive random walk forecasts, suggesting a potential for building management\nstrategies for portfolios of derivative products, akin to the ones widely used\nin the underlying equity and futures markets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 15:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

As a desirable side effect, high gain antennas\nprovide interference isolation, providing an opportunity to incorporate\nself-backhauling--BSs backhauling among themselves in a mesh architecture\nwithout significant loss in throughput--to enable the requisite large BS\ndensities. The use of directional antennas and resource sharing between access\nand backhaul links leads to coverage and rate trends that differ significantly\nfrom conventional microwave ($\\mu$W) cellular systems. In this paper, we\npropose a general and tractable mmW cellular model capturing these key trends\nand characterize the associated rate distribution.
