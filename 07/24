Under these assumptions, we show that, if the size of the\nstream is sufficiently large and players attribute enough value to future\nutilities, then the defined strategies are Sequential Equilibria of the\nextended game for any value of $f$. Moreover, the utility provided to each\nplayer is arbitrarily close to that provided in the original game. This shows\nthat we can persuade rational nodes to follow a dissemination protocol that\nuses any fanout, while arbitrarily minimising the relative overhead of\nmonitoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 17:02:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 09:07:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 2014 19:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}

The most popular way of detecting communities\nalgorithmically is to optimize the quality function known as modularity. When\noptimizing modularity, one compares the actual connections in a (static or\ntime-dependent) network to the connections obtained from a random-graph\nensemble that acts as a null model. The communities are then the sets of nodes\nthat are connected to each other densely relative to what is expected from the\nnull model. Clearly, the process of community detection depends fundamentally\non the choice of null model, so it is important to develop and analyze novel\nnull models that take into account appropriate features of the system under\nstudy. In this paper, we investigate the effects of using null models that take\nincorporate spatial information, and we propose a novel null model based on the\nradiation model of population spread.

The images\nshow that the morphologies of the extended continuum and the ionised gas\nemission from the galaxy are decoupled, extending almost perpendicular to each\nother.

The quiescent ionised gas kinematics at these locations\nsuggests that these filaments are tidal debris left over from a secondary\nmerger event that are illuminated by an AGN in the nuclear regions. The images\nalso reveal a complex morphology in the nuclear region of the galaxy for both\nthe continuum and the [OIII] emission.

From these fits we derive diagnostic line ratios that are\nused to investigate the ionisation mechanisms at the different locations in the\ngalaxy.

Finally, the\nhighest surface brightness [OIII] emission is found in a compact region that is\ncoincident with the so-called SE nuclear component.

An outstanding disadvantage of imposing such a restriction on the set\nfunction is that no result is implied for set functions deviating from the\nrestriction, even slightly. A more flexible approach, studied by Feige and\nIzsak, is to design an approximation algorithm whose approximation ratio\ndepends on the complexity of the instance, as measured by some complexity\nmeasure. Specifically, they introduced a complexity measure called supermodular\ndegree, measuring deviation from submodularity, and designed an algorithm for\nthe welfare maximization problem with an approximation ratio that depends on\nthis measure.\n  In this work, we give the first (to the best of our knowledge) algorithm for\nmaximizing an arbitrary monotone set function, subject to a k-extendible\nsystem. This class of constraints captures, for example, the intersection of\nk-matroids (note that a single matroid constraint is sufficient to capture the\nwelfare maximization problem).

During this stage,\nmacro-molecules called ribosomes travel along the mRNA strand linking\namino-acids together in a specific order to create a functioning protein. An\nimportant question is how to maximize protein production. Indeed, translation\nis known to consume most of the cell's energy and it is natural to assume that\nevolution shaped this process so that it maximizes the protein production rate.\nIf this is indeed so then one can estimate various parameters of the\ntranslation machinery by solving an appropriate mathematical optimization\nproblem. The same problem also arises in the context of synthetic biology,\nnamely, re-engineer heterologous genes in order to maximize their translation\nrate in a host organism. We consider the problem of maximizing the protein\nproduction rate using a computational model for translation-elongation called\nthe ribosome flow model (RFM). This model describes the flow of the ribosomes\nalong an mRNA chain of length n using a set of n first-order nonlinear ODEs. It\nalso includes n+1 positive parameters: the ribosomal initiation rate into the\nmRNA chain, and n elongation rates along the chain sites. We show that the\nsteady-state translation rate in the RFM is a strictly concave function of its\nparameters. This means that the problem of maximizing the translation rate\nunder a suitable constraint always admits a unique solution, and that this\nsolution can be determined using highly-efficient algorithms for solving convex\noptimization problems even for large values of n. Furthermore, our analysis\nshows that the optimal translation rate can be computed based only on the\noptimal initiation rate and the elongation rate of the codons near the\nbeginning of the ORF. We discuss some applications of the theoretical results\nto synthetic biology, molecular evolution, and functional genomics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 19:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-24"}

The Weiss temperature theta_p in the\nCurie-Weiss law is written in terms of the J{ij} values and TN in terms of the\nJ{ij} values and an assumed AF structure. Other magnetic and thermal properties\nare then expressed in terms of quantities easily accessible from experiment as\nlaws of corresponding states for a given spin S. For collinear ordering these\nproperties are the reduced temperature t = T/TN, the ratio f = theta_p/TN and\nS. For planar noncollinear helical or cycloidal ordering, an additional\nparameter is the wavevector of the helix or cycloid. The MFT is also applicable\nto AFs with other AF structures. The MFT predicts that chi(T <= TN) of\nnoncollinear 120 degree spin structures on triangular lattices is isotropic and\nindependent of S and T and thus clarifies the origin of this universally\nobserved behavior. The high-field magnetization and heat capacity for fields\napplied perpendicular to the ordering axis (collinear AFs) and ordering plane\n(planar noncollinear AFs) are also calculated and expressed for both types of\nAF structures as laws of corresponding states for a given S, and the reduced\nperpendicular field versus reduced temperature phase diagram is constructed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 19:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2015 16:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-02"}

Our IRIS observations allow us to follow the thermal\nevolution of type II spicules and finally confirm that the fading of Ca II H\nspicules appears to be caused by rapid heating to higher temperatures. The IRIS\nspicules do not fade but continue evolving, reaching higher and falling back\ndown after 500-800 s. Ca II H type II spicules are thus the initial stages of\nviolent and hotter events that mostly remain invisible in Ca II H filtergrams.\nThese events have very different properties from type I spicules, which show\nlower velocities and no fading from chromospheric passbands. The IRIS spectra\nof spicules show the same signature as their proposed disk counterparts,\nreinforcing earlier work. Spectroheliograms from spectral rasters also confirm\nthat quiet Sun spicules originate in bushes from the magnetic network.

The results from our correlation analysis of the\ntwo conal emission patterns strongly support the view that the two cones of\nthis pulsar (the outer and the inner cone) originate from a common system of\nsub-beams. We also see evidence for a twist in the emission columns, most\nlikely associated with a corresponding twist in the magnetic field structure.\nWe discuss these results, and their implications, including a possibility that\nthe core component of this pulsar shares its origin partly with the conal\ncounterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 20:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We\ntreat the turbulent velocity $v_T$ as a dynamical variable, and assume that it\nis adiabatically heated by the collapse. The theory predicts the run of\ndensity, infall velocity, and turbulent velocity, and the rate of star\nformation in compact massive gas clouds. The turbulent pressure is dynamically\nimportant at all radii, a result of the adiabatic heating. The system evolves\ntoward a coherent spatial structure with a fixed run of density,\n$\\rho(r,t)\\to\\rho(r)$; mass flows through this structure onto the central star\nor star cluster. We define the sphere of influence of the accreted matter by\n$m_*=M_g(r_*)$, where $m_*$ is the stellar plus disk mass in the nascent star\ncluster and $M_g(r)$ is the gas mass inside radius $r$. The density is given by\na broken power law with a slope $-1.5$ inside $r_*$ and $\\sim -1.6$ to $-1.8$\noutside $r_*$. Both $v_T$ and the infall velocity $|u_r|$ decrease with\ndecreasing $r$ for $r>r_*$; $v_T(r)\\sim r^p$, the size-linewidth relation, with\n$p\\approx0.2-0.3$, explaining the observation that Larson's Law is altered in\nmassive star forming regions. The infall velocity is generally smaller than the\nturbulent velocity at $r>r_*$. For $r<r_*$, the infall and turbulent velocities\nare again similar, and both increase with decreasing $r$ as $r^{-1/2}$, with a\nmagnitude about half of the free-fall velocity. The accreted (stellar) mass\ngrows super-linearly with time, $\\dot M_*=\\phi M_{\\rm cl}(t/\\tau_{ff})^2$, with\n$\\phi$ a dimensionless number somewhat less than unity, $M_{\\rm cl}$ the clump\nmass and $\\tau_{ff}$ the free-fall time of the clump.

We find that most molecular outflows are detected in both SiO and CO,\nalthough there are some cases of CO outflows with no SiO counterpart. We find a\nsignificant amount of narrow line SiO emission that appears to be unrelated to\noutflows. The fraction of the total SiO luminosity that is not associated with\noutflows is highly variable in the different MDCs (from 10% to 90%); this might\nbe a problem when extrapolating outflow properties from SiO luminosities\nwithout resolving individual outflows. The extent of the narrow SiO emission\nvaries from rather compact (~ 0.03 pc) to widespread (~0.2 pc), and its\nkinematics often differs from those found by other high-density tracers such as\nH13CO+. We find that the least centrally concentrated clumps with the least\nmassive protostellar cores have the most widespread narrow SiO emission. In\nline with previous evidence of SiO emission associated with low-velocity\nshocks, we propose an evolutionary picture to explain the existence and\ndistribution of narrow SiO line profiles. In this scenario, the least centrally\ncondensed MDCs are at an early stage where the SiO emission traces shocks from\nthe large-scale collapse of material onto the MDC (e.g. CygX-N40). As the MDC\ncollapses, the SiO emission becomes more confined to the close surroundings of\ncores, tracing the post-shock material from the infalling MDC against the dense\ncores (e.g. CygX-N3, N12, and N48). At later stages, when single massive\nprotostars are formed, the SiO luminosity is largely dominated by powerful\noutflows, and the weaker narrow component shows perhaps the last remnants of\nthe initial collapse (e.g. CygX-N53 and N63).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 21:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

This search yielded 186 nuclear flares in galaxies, of which\ntwo are excellent TDF candidates. Because of the systematic nature of the\nsearch, the very large number of galaxies, the long time of observation, and\nthe fact that non-TDFs were excluded without resorting to assumptions about TDF\ncharacteristics, this study provides an unparalleled opportunity to measure the\nTDF rate. To compute the rate of optical stellar tidal disruption events, we\nsimulate our entire pipeline to obtain the efficiency of detection. The rate\ndepends on the light curves of TDFs, which are presently still poorly\nconstrained. Using only the observed part of the SDSS light curves gives a\nmodel-independent upper limit to the optical TDF rate: < 2 10^-4 per year per\ngalaxy (90% CL). We develop three empirical models of the light curves, based\non the two SDSS light curves and two more recent and better-sampled Pan-STARRS\nTDF light curves, leading to our best-estimate of the rate: (1.5 -\n2.0)_{-1.3}^{+2.7} 10^-5 per year per galaxy. We explore the modeling\nuncertainties by considering two theoretically motivated light curve models, as\nwell as two different relationships between black hole mass and galaxy\nluminosity, and two different treatments of the cutoff in the visibility of\nTDFs at large black hole mass. From this we conclude that these sources of\nuncertainty are not significantly larger than the statistical ones.

This gives a much higher signal-noise\nratio at low resolution but also at higher resolutions by removing the\nscattered wings of the OH lines. The specifications call for high throughput\nand very low thermal and detector noise so that PRAXIS will remain sky noise\nlimited. The optical train is made of fore-optics, an IFU, a fibre bundle, the\nBragg grating unit, a second fibre bundle and a spectrograph. GNOSIS used the\npre-existing IRIS2 spectrograph while PRAXIS will use a new spectrograph\nspecifically designed for the fibre Bragg grating OH suppression and optimised\nfor 1470 nm to 1700 nm (it can also be used in the 1090 nm to 1260 nm band by\nchanging the grating and refocussing). This results in a significantly higher\ntransmission due to high efficiency coatings, a VPH grating at low incident\nangle and low absorption glasses. The detector noise will also be lower.\nThroughout the PRAXIS design special care was taken at every step along the\noptical path to reduce thermal emission or stop it leaking into the system.\nThis made the spectrograph design challenging because practical constraints\nrequired that the detector and the spectrograph enclosures be physically\nseparate by air at ambient temperature. At present, the instrument uses the\nGNOSIS fibre Bragg grating OH suppression unit. We intend to soon use a new OH\nsuppression unit based on multicore fibre Bragg gratings which will allow\nincreased field of view per fibre.

In this paper it is shown that if we replace the assumption\nregarding the existence of incoming and outgoing subspaces by the assumption of\nthe existence of Lyapunov operators for the quantum evolution (the existence of\nwhich has been proved for certain classes of quantum mechanical scattering\nproblems) then it is possible to construct a structure analogous to the\nLax-Phillips structure for scattering problems for which the spectrum of the\ngenerator of evolution is bounded from below.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 04:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-25"}

We particularly focus on the\ndependences of H2 gas mass fractions (f_H2), spatial distributions of HI and\nH2, and local H2-scaling relations on initial halo masses (M_h), baryonic\nfractions (f_bary), gas mass fractions (f_g), and Hubble types. The principal\nresults are as follows. The final f_H2 can be larger in disk galaxies with\nhigher M_h, f_bary, and f_g. Some low-mass disk models with M_h smaller than\n10^10 M_sun show extremely low f_H2 and thus no/little star formation, even if\ninitial f_g is quite large (>0.9). Big galactic bulges can severely suppress\nthe formation of H2 from HI on dust grains whereas strong stellar bars can not\nonly enhance f_H2 but also be responsible for the formation of H2-dominated\ncentral rings. The projected radial distributions of H2 are significantly more\ncompact than those of HI and the simulated radial profiles of H2-to-HI-ratios\n(R_mol) follow roughly R^-1.5 in MW-type disk models.

Multi-core processors and Clouds both require applications\nto be suitably modified to take advantage of the features they provide. In this\npaper, we analyze the state of the art of parallel and distributed simulation\ntechniques, and assess their applicability to multi-core architectures or\nClouds. It turns out that most of the current approaches exhibit limitations in\nterms of usability and adaptivity which may hinder their application to these\nnew computing architectures. We propose an adaptive simulation mechanism, based\non the multi-agent system paradigm, to partially address some of those\nlimitations. While it is unlikely that a single approach will work well on both\nsettings above, we argue that the proposed adaptive mechanism has useful\nfeatures which make it attractive both in a multi-core processor and in a Cloud\nsystem. These features include the ability to reduce communication costs by\nmigrating simulation components, and the support for adding (or removing) nodes\nto the execution architecture at runtime.

As the name suggests, PFASST is\nsimilar in spirit to a space-time FAS multigrid method performed over multiple\ntime-steps in parallel. However, since the original focus of PFASST has been on\nthe performance of the method in terms of time parallelism, the solution of any\nspatial system arising from the use of implicit or semi-implicit temporal\nmethods within PFASST have simply been assumed to be solved to some desired\naccuracy completely at each sub-step and each iteration by some unspecified\nprocedure. It hence is natural to investigate how iterative solvers in the\nspatial dimensions can be interwoven with the PFASST iterations and whether\nthis strategy leads to a more efficient overall approach. This paper presents\nan initial investigation on the relative performance of different strategies\nfor coupling PFASST iterations with multigrid methods for the implicit\ntreatment of diffusion terms in PDEs. In particular, we compare full accuracy\nmultigrid solves at each sub-step with a small fixed number of multigrid\nV-cycles. This reduces the cost of each PFASST iteration at the possible\nexpense of a corresponding increase in the number of PFASST iterations needed\nfor convergence.

This contribution treats the electron capture in 163 Holmium\ncompletely relativistic for the overlap and exchange corrections and the\ndescription of the bolometer Spectrum.

Non-relativistically this is only\npossible for ns(1/2) electron states. Relativistically also p(1/2) electrons\nhave a probability due to the lower part of the relativistic electron spinor,\nwhich does not disappear at the origin.

The purpose of this work is to give a consistent\nrelativistic formulation and treatment of the overlap and exchange corrections\nfor electron capture in 163 Ho to excited atomic states in 163 Dy and to show\nthe influence of the different configurations in the final Dy states. The\noverlap and exchange corrections are essential for the calorimetric spectrum of\nthe deexcitation of the hole states in Dysprosium.

An\nideal network should have the ability to 1) learn a set of patterns as they\narrive, 2) retrieve the correct patterns from noisy queries, and 3) maximize\nthe pattern retrieval capacity while maintaining the reliability in responding\nto queries. The majority of work on neural associative memories has focused on\ndesigning networks capable of memorizing any set of randomly chosen patterns at\nthe expense of limiting the retrieval capacity. In this paper, we show that if\nwe target memorizing only those patterns that have inherent redundancy (i.e.,\nbelong to a subspace), we can obtain all the aforementioned properties. This is\nin sharp contrast with the previous work that could only improve one or two\naspects at the expense of the third. More specifically, we propose framework\nbased on a convolutional neural network along with an iterative algorithm that\nlearns the redundancy among the patterns. The resulting network has a retrieval\ncapacity that is exponential in the size of the network. Moreover, the\nasymptotic error correction performance of our network is linear in the size of\nthe patterns. We then ex- tend our approach to deal with patterns lie\napproximately in a subspace. This extension allows us to memorize datasets\ncontaining natural patterns (e.g., images). Finally, we report experimental\nresults on both synthetic and real datasets to support our claims.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 10:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-25"}

However, it is not\nknown how the synaptic efficacies in the neuronal networks of the brain adapt\nsuch that they can reliably generate spikes at specific points in time.\nExisting activity-dependent plasticity rules like Spike-Timing-Dependent\nPlasticity are agnostic to the goal of learning spike times. On the other hand,\nthe existing formal and supervised learning algorithms perform a temporally\nprecise comparison of projected activity with the target, but there is no known\nbiologically plausible implementation of this comparison. Here, we propose a\nsimple and local unsupervised synaptic plasticity mechanism that is derived\nfrom the requirement of a balanced membrane potential. Since the relevant\nsignal for synaptic change is the postsynaptic voltage rather than spike times,\nwe call the plasticity rule Membrane Potential Dependent Plasticity (MPDP).\nCombining our plasticity mechanism with spike after-hyperpolarization causes a\nsensitivity of synaptic change to pre- and postsynaptic spike times which can\nreproduce Hebbian spike timing dependent plasticity for inhibitory synapses as\nwas found in experiments. In addition, the sensitivity of MPDP to the time\ncourse of the voltage when generating a spike allows MPDP to distinguish\nbetween weak (spurious) and strong (teacher) spikes, which therefore provides a\nneuronal basis for the comparison of actual and target activity. For\nspatio-temporal input spike patterns our conceptually simple plasticity rule\nachieves a surprisingly high storage capacity for spike associations.

This\nextremely low computational demand opens new possibilities for improving the\nquality of the models. Several rounds of model reconstruction, testing of the\nmodel's predictions against real experimental data, curation steps of the input\nmodel and the set of core reactions as well as cross-validations assays are\nrequired to reconstruct high-quality models. These semi-automated model\ncurations steps are in such extend not possible with competing algorithms due\nto their high computational demands.

In the analysis of observations of protoplanetary disks the dust phase\nis often assumed to consist of spherical grains, allowing one to apply the Mie\nscattering formalism. However, in reality, the shape of dust grains is expected\nto deviate strongly from that of a sphere. We investigate the influence of\nporous dust grains on the temperature distribution and observable appearance of\nprotoplanetary disks for dust grain porosities of up to 60 %. We performed\nradiative transfer modeling to simulate the temperature distribution, spectral\nenergy distribution, and spatially resolved intensity and polarization maps.\nThe optical properties of porous grains were calculated using the method of\ndiscrete dipole approximation. We find that the flux in the optical wavelength\nrange is for porous grains higher than for compact, spherical grains. The\nprofile of the silicate peak at 9.7 um strongly depends on the degree of grain\nporosity. The temperature distribution shows significant changes in the\ndirection perpendicular to the midplane. Moreover, simulated polarization maps\nreveal an increase of the polarization degree by a factor of about four when\nporous grains are considered, regardless of the disk inclination. The\npolarization direction is reversed in selected disk regions, depending on the\nwavelength, grain porosity, and disk inclination. We discuss several possible\nexplanations of this effect and find that multiple scattering explains the\neffect best. Porosity influences the observable appearance of protoplanetary\ndisks. In particular, the polarization reversal shows a dependence on grain\nporosity. The physical conditions within the disk are altered by porosity,\nwhich might have an effect on the processes of grain growth and disk evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 13:39:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

This method\nis explained in some detail.\n  Finally, an update for the status of the vacuum stability problem in the\nStandard Model up to the Planck scale is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 15:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-25"}

Here we show that finite-time scaling (FTS)\nprovides a detailed improved understanding of the mechanism. In particular, the\nfinite time scale, which is introduced by the external driving (or quenching)\nand results in FTS, is the origin of the division of the adiabatic regimes from\nthe impulse regime in the KZ mechanism. The origin of the KZ scaling for the\ndefect density, generated during the driving through a critical point, is not\nthat the correlation length ceases growing in the nonadiabatic impulse regime,\nbut rather, is that it is taken over by the effective finite length scale\ncorresponding to the finite time scale.

It is demonstrated that the stability of the\nflow with respect to growth of fluctuations with scale smaller than $l_d$ leads\nto a non-trivial constraint. That involves the dimensionless strength $Fl$ of\nfluctuations of the gradients of the scalar in the direction of gravity and the\nRayleigh scale $L$ depending on the Rayleigh number $Ra$, the Nusselt number\n$Nu$ and $l_d$. The constraint implies that the stratified fluid at rest, which\nis linearly stable, develops instability in the limit of large $Ra$. This\nlimits observability of solution for the flow around small swimmer in quiescent\nstratified fluid that has closed streamlines at scale $L$ [A. M. Ardekani and\nR. Stocker, Phys. Rev.

To ensure correctness, the transactions used to execute these\ncritical sections \"subscribe\" to the lock by reading it and checking that it is\navailable. A recent paper proposed using the tempting \"lazy subscription\"\noptimization for a similar technique in a different context, namely\ntransactional systems that use a single global lock (SGL) to protect all\ntransactional data. We identify several pitfalls that show that lazy\nsubscription \\emph{is not safe} for TLE because unmodified critical sections\nexecuting before subscribing to the lock may behave incorrectly in a number of\nsubtle ways. We also show that recently proposed compiler support for modifying\ntransaction code to ensure subscription occurs before any incorrect behavior\ncould manifest is not sufficient to avoid all of the pitfalls we identify. We\nfurther argue that extending such compiler support to avoid all pitfalls would\nadd substantial complexity and would usually limit the extent to which\nsubscription can be deferred, undermining the effectiveness of the\noptimization. Hardware extensions suggested in the recent proposal also do not\naddress all of the pitfalls we identify. In this extended version of our WTTM\n2014 paper, we describe hardware extensions that make lazy subscription safe,\nboth for SGL-based transactional systems and for TLE, without the need for\nspecial compiler support.
