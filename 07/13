The phase changes in the analytic signal around the Hilbert\nenvelope (HE) peaks are found to vary according to the polarity of the given\nspeech signal. The relevant HE peaks for the Hilbert phase analysis are\nselected by estimating the instants of significant excitation in speech. The\nspeech polarity identification rate obtained for the proposed method is almost\nequal to the state of the art residual skewness method for speech polarity\ndetection. The proposed method also provides the same results for the polarity\ndetection in electro-glottogram signals. Finally, the robustness of the\nproposed method is confirmed from the reduced detection error rates obtained in\nnoisy environments with various signal to noise ratios (SNRs).

As a first step towards developing more realistic descriptions to aid\nin the analysis of experimental data and the design of new materials, the LCT\nis extended here to treat models of polymer melts in which the backbone and\nside groups have different interaction strengths, so three energy parameters\nare present, namely, backbone-backbone, side group-side group, and\nbackbone-side group interaction energies.

Here we\npresent a method to reconstruct the initial linear density field from an input\nnon-linear density field, employing the Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(HMC) algorithm combined with Particle Mesh (PM) dynamics. The HMC+PM method is\napplied to cosmological simulations, and the reconstructed linear density\nfields are then evolved to the present day with N-body simulations. The\nconstrained simulations so obtained accurately reproduce both the amplitudes\nand phases of the input simulations at various $z$. Using a PM model with a\ngrid cell size of 0.75 Mpc/h and 40 time-steps in the HMC can recover more than\nhalf of the phase information down to a scale k~0.85 h/Mpc at high z and to\nk~3.4 h/Mpc at z=0, which represents a significant improvement over similar\nreconstruction models in the literature, and indicates that our model can\nreconstruct the formation histories of cosmic structures over a large dynamical\nrange. Adopting PM models with higher spatial and temporal resolutions yields\neven better reconstructions, suggesting that our method is limited more by the\navailability of computer resource than by principle. Dynamic models of\nstructure evolution adopted in many earlier investigations can induce\nnon-Gaussianity in the reconstructed linear density field, which in turn can\ncause large systematic deviations in the predicted halo mass function.

Two complementary schemes are presented: a\ngraphical approach for individual cases, and an analytical approach for general\nproperties. The spatially nonlinear interaction of dynamic variability and the\nreference flow results in flux variability. The characteristic time-scale of\nthe dynamic variability and the length-scale of the flux variability in a unit\nof flight-time govern the spatio-temporal interaction that leads to transport.\nThe non-dimensional ratio of the two characteristic scales is shown to be a a\ncritical parameter. The pseudo-lobe sequence along the reference streamline\ndescribes spatial coherency and temporal evolution of transport. For\nfinite-time transport from an initial time up to the present, the\ncharacteristic length-scale of the flux variability regulates the width of the\npseudo-lobes. The phase speed of pseudo-lobe propagation averages the reference\nflow and the flux variability. In contrast, for definite transport over a fixed\ntime interval and spatial segment, the characteristic time-scale of the dynamic\nvariability regulates the width of the pseudo-lobes. Generation of the\npseudo-lobe sequence appears to be synchronous with the dynamic variability,\nalthough it propagates with the reference flow. In either case, the critical\ncharacteristic ratio is found to be one, corresponding to a resonance of the\nflux variability with the reference flow. Using a kinematic model, we\ndemonstrate the framework for two types of transport in a blocked flow of the\nmid-latitude atmosphere: across the meandering jet axis and between the jet and\nrecirculating cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jul 2014 13:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

Unfortunately, many results have been\nnegative, establishing that a wide variety of problems require $\\Omega(n^2)$\nspace to solve. One of the few bright spots has been the development of\nsemi-streaming algorithms for a handful of graph problems -- these algorithms\nuse space $O(n\\cdot\\text{polylog}(n))$.\n  In the annotated data streaming model of Chakrabarti et al., a\ncomputationally limited client wants to compute some property of a massive\ninput, but lacks the resources to store even a small fraction of the input, and\nhence cannot perform the desired computation locally. The client therefore\naccesses a powerful but untrusted service provider, who not only performs the\nrequested computation, but also proves that the answer is correct.\n  We put forth the notion of semi-streaming algorithms for annotated graph\nstreams (semi-streaming annotation schemes for short). These are protocols in\nwhich both the client's space usage and the length of the proof are $O(n \\cdot\n\\text{polylog}(n))$. We give evidence that semi-streaming annotation schemes\nrepresent a substantially more robust solution concept than does the standard\nsemi-streaming model. On the positive side, we give semi-streaming annotation\nschemes for two dynamic graph problems that are intractable in the standard\nmodel: (exactly) counting triangles, and (exactly) computing maximum matchings.\nThe former scheme answers a question of Cormode. On the negative side, we\nidentify for the first time two natural graph problems (connectivity and\nbipartiteness in a certain edge update model) that can be solved in the\nstandard semi-streaming model, but cannot be solved by annotation schemes of\n\"sub-semi-streaming\" cost.
