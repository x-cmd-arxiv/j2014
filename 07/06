This problem is known\nas rendezvous. Agents move in synchronous rounds using a deterministic\nalgorithm. In each round, an agent decides to either remain idle or to move to\none of the adjacent nodes. Each agent has a distinct integer label from the set\n$\\{1,...,L\\}$, which it can use in the execution of the algorithm, but it does\nnot know the label of the other agent.\n  If $D$ is the distance between the initial positions of the agents, then\n$\\Omega(D)$ is an obvious lower bound on the time of rendezvous. However, if\neach agent has no initial knowledge other than its label, time $O(D)$ is\nusually impossible to achieve.

In this paper, we study the\ninterplay between atomic diffusion and fingering convection in A-type stars,\nand its role in the establishment and evolution of iron accumulation layers. To\ndo so, we use a combination of three-dimensional idealized numerical\nsimulations of fingering convection, and one-dimensional realistic stellar\nmodels. Using the three-dimensional simulations, we first validate the mixing\nprescription for fingering convection recently proposed by Brown et al. (2013),\nand identify what system parameters (total mass of iron, iron diffusivity,\nthermal diffusivity, etc.) play a role in the overall evolution of the layer.\nWe then implement the Brown et al.

The latter mixes iron with the surrounding material very\nefficiently, and the resulting iron layer is very weak. However, taking helium\nsettling into account partially stabilizes the iron profile against fingering\nconvection, and a large iron overabundance can accumulate. The opacity also\nincreases significantly as a result, and in some cases ultimately triggers\ndynamical convection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Jul 2014 21:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

First, face images are modeled by receptive field theory, and\nthe representation is an image with many channels of Gaussian receptive maps.\nWe activate a few most distinguish channels by supervised learning. Second, the\nface image is further represented by patches of picked channels, and we search\nfrom the over-complete patch pool to activate only those most discriminant\npatches. Third, the feature descriptor of each patch is further projected to\nlower dimension subspace with discriminant subspace analysis.\n  Learned feature of activated patches are concatenated to get a full face\nrepresentation.A linear classifier is learned to separate face pairs from same\nsubjects and different subjects. As the number of face pairs are extremely\nlarge, we introduce ADMM (alternative direction method of multipliers) to train\nthe linear classifier on a computing cluster. Experiments show that more\ntraining samples will bring notable accuracy improvement.\n  We conduct experiments on FRGC and LFW. Results show that the proposed\napproach outperforms existing algorithms under the same protocol notably.\nBesides, the proposed approach is small in memory footprint, and low in\ncomputing cost, which makes it suitable for embedded applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jul 2014 12:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-08"}

Devices in\nthis group may receive partial content from the source due to packet losses\nover wireless broadcast links. We further consider that packet losses are\ndifferent for different devices. The remaining missing content at each device\ncan then be recovered, thanks to cooperation among the devices by exploiting\ndevice-to-device (D2D) connections. In this context, the minimum amount of time\nthat can guarantee a complete acquisition of the common content at every device\nis referred to as the \"completion time\". It has been shown that instantly\ndecodable network coding (IDNC) reduces the completion time as compared to no\nnetwork coding in this scenario. Yet, for applications such as video streaming,\nnot all packets have the same importance and not all devices are interested in\nthe same quality of content. This problem is even more interesting when\nadditional, but realistic constraints, such as strict deadline, bandwidth, or\nlimited energy are added in the problem formulation. We assert that direct\napplication of IDNC in such a scenario yields poor performance in terms of\ncontent quality and completion time.

This motif may reduce cross-talk between signalling pathways, as the\nsecond phosphorylation site allows for proofreading, especially when\nphosphorylation is distributive rather than processive. Recent studies suggest\nthat phosphorylation can be `pseudo-processive' in the crowded cellular\nenvironment, as rebinding after the first phosphorylation is enhanced by slow\ndiffusion. Here, we use a simple model with unsaturated reactants to show that\nspecificity for one substrate over another drops as rebinding increases and\npseudo-processive behavior becomes possible. However, this loss of specificity\nwith increased rebinding is typically also observed if two distinct enzyme\nspecies are required for phosphorylation, i.e. when the system is necessarily\ndistributive. Thus the loss of specificity is due to an intrinsic reduction in\nselectivity with increased rebinding, which benefits inefficient reactions,\nrather than pseudo-processivity itself.

We establish in this contribution that this hypothesis is valid only for\nuniform rotational motions. We give a more general formulation of this coupling\nproblem, with a compact formulation. We consider the mechanical modeling of a\nrigid body with a motion of small amplitude, containing an incompressible fluid\nin the linearized regime. We first establish that the fluid motion remains\nirrotational in a Galilean referential if it is true at the initial time. When\ncontinuity of normal velocity and pressure are prescribed on the free surface,\nwe establish that the global coupled problem conserves an energy functional\ncomposed by three terms. We introduce the Stokes - Zhukovsky vector fields,\nsolving Neumann problems for the Laplace operator in the fluid in order to\nrepresent the rotational rigid motion with irrotational vector fields. Then we\nhave a good framework to consider the coupled problem between the fluid and the\nrigid motion. The coupling between the free surface and the ad hoc component of\nthe velocity potential introduces a \"Neumann to Dirichlet\" operator that allows\nto write the coupled system in a very compact form. The final expression of a\nLagrangian for the coupled system is derived and the Euler-Lagrange equations\nof the coupled motion are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jul 2014 06:32:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 16:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

The dimensionality of shortest paths is calculated\nas a function of interaction cutoff distance. Shortest paths are self similar\nwith a fractal dimension of 1.12 when calculated with step lengths larger than\n6.8 {\\AA}. Paths are multifractal below 6.8 {\\AA}. The number of steps to\ntraverse a shortest path is a discontinuous function of cutoff size at short\ncutoff values, showing abrupt decreases to smaller values as cutoff distance\nincreases. As information progresses along the direction of a shortest path a\nlarge set of residues are affected because they are interacting neighbors to\nthe residues of the shortest path. Thus, several residues are involved\ndiffusively in information transport which may be identified with the present\nmodel. An algorithm is introduced to determine the residues of a given shortest\npath. The shortest path residues are the highly visited residues during\ninformation transport. These paths are shown to lie on the high entropy\nlandscape of the protein where entropy is taken to increase with abundance of\nvisits to nodes during signal transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jul 2014 08:20:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 13:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-28"}
