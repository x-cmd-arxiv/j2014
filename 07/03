In addition, the dynamic dipolar\nfield contributes to the interlayer coupling. By solving the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation for macrospin excitations and the\nexchange-dipole volume as well as surface spin waves, we compute the effect of\nthe dynamic coupling on the resonance frequencies and linewidths of the various\nmodes.

The dynamic coupling is reduced for\nshort-wavelength spin waves, and there is no synchronization. For intermediate\nwavelengths, the coupling can be increased by the dipolar field such that the\nmodes in the two ferromagnetic insulators can couple despite possible small\nfrequency asymmetries.

This finds its motivations in the physical\nlimitations one can have in constructing links in practice, and it has been\nstudied in the past only when the routing cost component of a player is given\nby the sum of distances to all the other nodes. Here, we focus on another\npopular routing cost, namely that which takes into account for each player its\n\\emph{maximum} distance to any other player. For this version of the game, we\nfirst analyze some of its computational and dynamic aspects, and then we\naddress the problem of understanding the structure of associated pure Nash\nequilibria. In this respect, we show that the corresponding price of anarchy\n(PoA) is fairly bad, even for several basic classes of host graphs. More\nprecisely, we first exhibit a lower bound of $\\Omega (\\sqrt{ n / (1+\\alpha)})$\nfor any $\\alpha = o(n)$. Notice that this implies a counter-intuitive lower\nbound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ for very small values of $\\alpha$ (i.e., edges can\nbe activated almost for free). Then, we show that when the host graph is\nrestricted to be either $k$-regular (for any constant $k \\geq 3$), or a\n2-dimensional grid, the PoA is still $\\Omega(1+\\min\\{\\alpha,\n\\frac{n}{\\alpha}\\})$, which is proven to be tight for\n$\\alpha=\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$. On the positive side, if $\\alpha \\geq n$, we show\nthe PoA is $O(1)$. Finally, in the case in which the host graph is very sparse\n(i.e., $|E(H)|=n-1+k$, with $k=O(1)$), we prove that the PoA is $O(1)$, for any\n$\\alpha$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2014 16:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-03"}

It\nhas been claimed, for example, that VSTM possesses a limited amount of\ncognitive or neural \"resources\" that can be used to remember a visual display.\nIn this paper, we highlight the potential importance of a previously neglected\nfactor that might contribute significantly to performance limitations in VSTM\ntasks: namely, a mismatch between the prior expectations and/or the internal\nnoise properties of the visual system based primarily on its adaptation to the\nstatistics of the natural environment and the statistics of the visual stimuli\nused in most VSTM experiments. We call this 'model mismatch'. Surprisingly, we\nshow that model mismatch alone, without assuming a general resource or capacity\nlimitation, can, in principle, account for some of the main qualitative\ncharacteristics of performance limitations observed in VSTM tasks, including:\n(i) monotonic decline in memory precision with increasing set size; (ii)\nvariability in memory precision across items and trials; and (iii) different\nset-size dependencies for initial encoding rate and asymptotic precision when\nthe duration of image presentation is varied. We also investigate the\nconsequences of using experimental stimuli that more closely match the prior\nexpectations and/or internal noise properties of the visual system. The results\nreveal qualitatively very different patterns of behavior for such stimuli,\nsuggesting that researchers should be cautious about generalizing the results\nof experiments using ecologically unrealistic stimulus statistics to\necologically more realistic stimuli.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2014 16:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-03"}

Thermal transport at the nanoscale is fundamentally\ndifferent from that at the macroscale and is determined by the distribution of\ncarrier mean free paths in a material, the length scales of the heat sources,\nand the distance over which heat is transported. Past work has shown that\nFourier's law for heat conduction dramatically over-predicts the rate of heat\ndissipation from heat sources with dimensions smaller than the mean free path\nof the dominant heat-carrying phonons. In this work, we uncover a new regime of\nnanoscale thermal transport that dominates when the separation between\nnanoscale heat sources is small compared with the dominant phonon mean free\npaths. Surprisingly, the interplay between neighboring heat sources can\nfacilitate efficient, diffusive-like heat dissipation, even from the smallest\nnanoscale heat sources. This finding suggests that thermal management in\nnanoscale systems including integrated circuits might not be as challenging as\nprojected. Finally, we demonstrate a unique and new capability to extract mean\nfree path distributions of phonons in materials, allowing the first\nexperimental validation of differential conductivity predictions from\nfirst-principles calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2014 17:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

Here we use fine-scale imaging and a minimal\nmathematical model to study sperm aggregation in the rodent genus $Peromyscus$.\nWe demonstrate that as the number of sperm cells in an aggregate increase, the\ngroup moves with more persistent linearity but without increasing speed; this\nbenefit, however, is offset in larger aggregates as the geometry of the group\nforces sperm to swim against one another. The result is a non-monotonic\nrelationship between aggregate size and average velocity with both a\ntheoretically predicted and empirically observed optimum of 6-7\nsperm/aggregate. To understand the role of sexual selection in driving these\nsperm group dynamics, we compared two sister-species with divergent mating\nsystems and find that sperm of $P.\\,maniculatus$ (highly promiscuous), which\nhave evolved under intense competition, form optimal-sized aggregates more\noften than sperm of $P.\\,polionotus$ (strictly monogamous), which lack\ncompetition.

To fully extract motion\ninformation hidden in projection images, we partitioned a projection image into\nsmall patches. We utilized a sparse learning method to automatically select\npatches that have a high correlation with principal component analysis (PCA)\ncoefficients of a lung motion model. A model that maps the patch intensity to\nthe PCA coefficients is built along with the patch selection process. Based on\nthis model, a measured projection can be used to predict the PCA coefficients,\nwhich are further used to generate a motion vector field and hence a volumetric\nimage. We have also proposed an intensity baseline correction method based on\nthe partitioned projection, where the first and the second moments of pixel\nintensities at a patch in a simulated image are matched with those in a\nmeasured image via a linear transformation. The proposed method has been valid\nin simulated data and real phantom data. The algorithm is able to identify\npatches that contain relevant motion information, e.g. diaphragm region. It is\nfound that intensity correction step is important to remove the systematic\nerror in the motion prediction. For the simulation case, the sparse learning\nmodel reduced prediction error for the first PCA coefficient to 5%, compared to\nthe 10% error when sparse learning is not used. 95th percentile error for the\npredicted motion vector is reduced from 2.40 mm to 0.92mm. In the phantom case,\nthe predicted tumor motion trajectory is successfully reconstructed with 0.82\nmm mean vector field error compared to 1.66 mm error without using the sparse\nlearning method. The algorithm robustness with respect to sparse level, patch\nsize, and existence of diaphragm, as well as computation time, has also been\nstudied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2014 18:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

In the first place, the algorithm maintains a\nstate of minimal partition size in the spanning tree due to edge deletion. This\nis realized by swapping peripheral edges, more precisely leaf edges, in most of\nedge exchange operations. Consequently, the main structure of the spanning\ntrees is preserved during the steps of the enumeration process. This extra\nconstraint proves to be advantageous in many applications where the partition\nsize is a factor in the solution cost. Secondly, we introduce, and utilize, the\nnew concept of edge promotion: the exchanged edges always share one end.\nPractically, and as a result of this property, the interface between the two\npartitions of the spanning tree during edge exchange has to be maintained from\none side only.\n  For a graph $G(V,E)$, MP algorithm requires $O(log V+E/V)$ expected time and\n$OV log V)$ worst case time for generating each spanning tree. MP algorithm\nrequires a total expected space limit of $O(E log V)$ with worst case limit of\n$O(EV)$. Like all edge exchange algorithms, MP algorithm retains the advantage\nof compacted output of $O(1)$ per spanning tree by listing the relative\ndifferences only.\n  Three sample real-world applications of spanning trees enumeration are\nexplored and the effects of using MP algorithm are studied. Namely:\nconstruction of nets of polyhedra, multi-robots spanning tree routing, and\ncomputing the electric current in edges of a network. We report that MP\nalgorithm outperforms other algorithm by $O(V)$ time complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2014 17:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-04"}

Many large-scale spectroscopic\nsurveys operate at low to moderate spectral resolution for efficiency in\nobserving large samples, which makes the stellar characterization difficult due\nto the high degree of blending of spectral features. While most surveys use\nspectral synthesis, in this work we employ an alternative method based on\nspectral indices to determine the atmospheric parameters of a sample of nearby\nFGK dwarfs and subgiants observed by the MARVELS survey at moderate resolving\npower (R~12,000). We have developed three codes to automatically normalize the\nobserved spectra, measure the equivalent widths of the indices and, through the\ncomparison of those with values calculated with pre-determined calibrations,\nderive the atmospheric parameters of the stars. The calibrations were built\nusing a sample of 309 stars with precise stellar parameters obtained from the\nanalysis of high-resolution FEROS spectra. A validation test of the method was\nconducted with a sample of 30 MARVELS targets that also have reliable\natmospheric parameters from high-resolution spectroscopic analysis.

Using first-principles\ndensity-functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that proton diffusion in\ntungsten oxide dihydrate (WO$_{3}$.2H$_{2}$O), a known good proton conductor,\ntakes place within the layers of corner-sharing WO$_{6}$ octahedra without\ndirect involvement of structural water.

The\npreferred proton diffusion path in WO$_{3}$.2H$_{2}$O is essentially the same\nas in $\\gamma$-WO$_{3}$, and we find an activation energy of 0.35 eV for the\nlatter, which agrees well with the experimental values. In contrast to the\nsmall intercalation voltages calculated for WO$_{3}$ and WO$_{3}$.2H$_{2}$O, we\nfind that proton absorption in the monohydrate WO$_{3}$.H$_{2}$O is\nenergetically highly favorable, corresponding to voltages in excess of 1 eV in\nthe dilute limit.

On the\ncontrary, state-of-the-art automatic biofilm methods fail to make their way\ninto clinical practice because of the lack of effective mechanism to\nincorporate human input to handle praxis or misclassified regions. Manual\ndelineation, the current gold standard, is time consuming and subject to expert\nbias. In this paper, we introduce a new semi-automated software tool,\nBiofilmQuant, for dental biofilm quantification in quantitative light-induced\nfluorescence (QLF) images. The software uses a robust statistical modeling\napproach to automatically segment the QLF image into three classes (background,\nbiofilm, and tooth substratum) based on the training data. This initial\nsegmentation has shown a high degree of consistency and precision on more than\n200 test QLF dental scans. Further, the proposed software provides the\nclinicians full control to fix any misclassified areas using a single click. In\naddition, BiofilmQuant also provides a complete solution for the longitudinal\nquantitative analysis of biofilm of the full set of teeth, providing greater\nease of usability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 02:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

For example,\ncookies might be cleared by users regularly. Apple has stopped apps accessing\nUDIDs, and Android phones use some special permission to protect IMEI code. To\naddress this challenge, some recent studies have worked on tracing smart phones\nusing the hardware features resulted from the imperfect manufacturing process.\nThese works have demonstrated that different devices can be differentiated to\neach other. However, it still has a long way to go in order to replace cookie\nand be deployed in real world scenarios, especially in terms of properties like\nuniqueness, robustness, etc. In this paper, we presented a novel method to\ngenerate stable and unique device ID stealthy for smartphones by exploiting the\nfrequency response of the speaker. With carefully selected audio frequencies\nand special sound wave patterns, we can reduce the impacts of non-linear\neffects and noises, and keep our feature extraction process un-noticeable to\nusers. The extracted feature is not only very stable for a given smart phone\nspeaker, but also unique to that phone. The feature contains rich information\nthat is equivalent to around 40 bits of entropy, which is enough to identify\nbillions of different smart phones of the same model. We have built a prototype\nto evaluate our method, and the results show that the generated device ID can\nbe used as a replacement of cookie.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 07:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-04"}

Our\napproach is a coarse-grained model based on integral equation theory, which can\nrepresent polymer chains at variable levels of chemical details. The model is\nanalytical and depends on molecular and thermodynamic parameters of the system\nunder study, as well as on the direct correlation function in the k --> 0\nlimit, c0. A numerical solution to the PRISM integral equations is used to\ndetermine c0, by adjusting the value of the effective hard sphere diameter, d,\nto agree with the predicted equation of state. This single quantity\nparameterizes the coarse-grained potential, which is used to perform mesoscale\nsimulations that are directly compared with atomistic-level simulations of the\nsame system. We test our coarse-graining formalism by comparing structural\ncorrelations, isothermal compressibility, equation of state, Helmholtz and\nGibbs free energies, and potential energy and entropy using both united atom\nand coarse-grained descriptions.

We find that using an accurate model for the\npolarizations of the acoustic phonon modes is crucial to obtain correct\nnumerical results. The interactions between electrons and acoustic phonon\nmodes, the gauge field and deformation potential, are calculated at the DFT\nlevel in the framework of linear response. The zero-momentum limit of acoustic\nphonons is interpreted as a strain pattern, allowing the calculation of the\nacoustic gauge field parameter in the GW approximation. The role of electronic\nscreening on the electron-phonon matrix elements is investigated. We then solve\nthe Boltzmann equation semi-analytically in graphene, including both acoustic\nand optical phonon scattering. We show that, in the Bloch-Gr\\\"uneisen and\nequipartition regimes, the electronic transport is mainly ruled by the\nunscreened acoustic gauge field, while the contribution due to the deformation\npotential is negligible and strongly screened. By comparing with experimental\ndata, we show that the contribution of acoustic phonons to resistivity is\ndoping- and substrate-independent. The DFT+GW approach underestimates this\ncontribution to resistivity by about 30 %. Above 270K, the calculated\nresistivity underestimates the experimental one more severely, the\nunderestimation being larger at lower doping. We show that, beside remote\nphonon scattering, a possible explanation for this disagreement is the\nelectron-electron interaction that strongly renormalizes the coupling to\nintrinsic optical-phonon modes. Finally, after discussing the validity of the\nMatthiessen rule in graphene, we derive simplified analytical solutions of the\nBoltzmann equation to extract the coupling to acoustic phonons, related to the\nstrain-induced gauge field, directly from experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 09:18:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 12:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-12"}

Kepler-78 is an active star and radial velocity variations\ndue to activity were removed using a Floating Chunk Offset (FCO) method where\nan orbital solution was made to the data by allowing the velocity offsets of\nindividual nights to vary. We show that if we had no a priori knowledge of the\ntransit period the FCO method used as a periodogram would still have detected\nKepler-78b in the radial velocity data. It can thus be effective at finding\nunknown short-period signals in the presence of significant activity noise.\nUsing the FCO method while keeping the ephemeris and orbital phase fixed to the\nphotometric values and using only data from nights where 6-10 measurements were\ntaken results in a K-amplitude of 1.34 +/- 0.25 m/s. a planet mass of 1.31 +/-\n0.24 M_Earth, and a planet density of rho = 4.5 (-2.0/+2.2) g/cm^3.

However, transit times in circumbinary systems are influenced both\nby the gravitational perturbations and the orbital phase variations of the\ncentral binary star. Adopting a coplanar analog of Kepler-16 as an example, we\nfind that circumbinary planets can transit the same star more than once during\na single planetary orbit, a phenomenon we call \"tight transits\". In certain\ngeometric, the projected orbital velocity of the planet and the secondary star\ncan approach zero and change sign, resulting in very long transits and/or 2-3\ntransits during a single binary orbit. Whether tight transits are possible for\na particular system depends primarily on the binary mass ratio and the orbital\narchitecture of both the binary and the planet. We derive a time-dependent\ncriterion to judge when tight transits are possible for any circumbinary\nsystem. These results are verified with full dynamical integrations that also\nreveal other tight transit characteristics, i.e., the transit durations and the\nintervals between tight transits. For the seven currently known circumbinary\nsystems, we estimate these critical parameters both analytically and\nnumerically. Due to the mutual inclination between the planet and the binary,\ntight transits can only occur across the less massive star B in Kepler-16, -34,\n-35, and -47 (for both planets). The long-term average frequency of tight\ntransits (compared to typical transits) for Kepler-16, -34, and -35 are\nestimated to be several percent. Using full numerical integrations, the next\ntight transit for each system is predicted and the soonest example appears to\nbe Kepler-47b and -47c, which are likely to have tight transits before 2025.\nThese unique and valuable events often deserve special observational scrutiny.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 10:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The origin of the gamma-ray emission has been further\ninvestigated with HESS and the Fermi-LAT. The gamma-ray data provided by 61h\n(HESS) and 4 yrs (Fermi LAT) of observations cover over 5 decades in energy\n(1.8GeV - 30TeV). The morphology and spectrum of the TeV and GeV sources have\nbeen studied and multi-wavelength data have been used to investigate the origin\nof the observed emission. The TeV source can be modeled with a sum of two\ncomponents: one point-like and one significantly extended (sig_TeV =\n0.17{\\deg}), both centered on SNR W41 and exhibiting spectra described by a\npower law of index 2.6. The GeV source detected with Fermi is extended (sig_GeV\n=0.15{\\deg}) and morphologically matches the VHE emission. Its spectrum can be\ndescribed by a power-law with index 2.15 and joins smoothly the one of the\nwhole TeV source. A break appears in the spectra around 100 GeV. Two main\nscenarios are proposed to explain the emission: a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or\nthe interaction of SNR W41 with a molecular cloud. X-ray observations suggest\nthe presence of a point-like source (pulsar candidate) near the center of the\nSNR and non-thermal X-ray diffuse emission which could arise from a potential\nPWN. The PWN scenario is supported by the match of of the TeV and GeV positions\nwith the putative pulsar. However, the overall spectrum is reproduced by a\n1-zone leptonic model only if an excess of low-energy electrons is injected by\na high spin-down power pulsar. This low-energy component is not needed if the\npoint-like TeV source is unrelated to the extended GeV and TeV sources. The\ninteracting SNR scenario is supported by the spatial coincidence between the\ngamma-ray sources, the detection of OH maser lines and the hadronic modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 10:50:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Recent studies have indicated that intra-tumoural heterogeneity has a\nsignificant role in driving resistance to chemotherapy in many human\nmalignancies. Multiple factors including the internal cell-cycle dynamics and\nthe external microenvironement contribute to the intra-tumoural heterogeneity.\nIn this paper we present a hybrid, multiscale, individual-based mathematical\nmodel, incorporating internal cell-cycle dynamics and changes in oxygen\nconcentration, to study the effects of delivery of several different\nchemotherapeutic drugs on the heterogeneous subpopulations of cancer cells with\nvarying cell-cycle dynamics. The computational simulation results from the\nmultiscale model are in good agreement with available experimental data and\nsupport the hypothesis that slow-cycling sub-populations of tumour cells within\na growing tumour mass can induce drug resistance to chemotherapy and thus the\nuse of conventional chemotherapy may actually result in the emergence of\ndominant, therapy-resistant, slow-cycling subpopulations of tumour cells. Our\nresults indicate that the appearance of this chemotherapeutic resistance is\nmainly due to the inability of the administered drug to target all cancer cells\nirrespective of the stage in the cell-cycle they are in i.e. most\nchemotherapeutic drugs target cells in a particular phase/phases of the\ncell-cycle, and hence always spare some cancer cells that are not in the\ntargeted cell-cycle phase/phases. The results also suggest that this\ncell-cycle-mediated drug resistance may be overcome by using multiple doses of\ncell-cycle, phase-specific chemotherapy that targets cells in all phases and\nits appropriate sequencing and scheduling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 11:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-04"}

Nevertheless, in many industrial applications, grains are\nhorizontally transported at constant velocity, lying on conveyor belts or\nfloating on the surface of flowing liquids. Unlike fluid flows, that are\ncontrolled by the pressure, granular flow is not sensitive to the local\npressure but rather to the local velocity of the grains at the outlet. We can\nalso expect the flow rate to depend on the local density of the grains. Indeed,\nvertical systems are packed in dense configurations by gravity but, in\ncontrast, in horizontal systems the density can take a large range of values,\npotentially very small, which may significantly alter the flow rate. In the\npresent article, we study, for different initial packing fractions, the\ndischarge through an orifice of monodisperse grains driven at constant velocity\nby a horizontal conveyor belt. We report how, during the discharge, the packing\nfraction is modified by the presence of the outlet and we analyze how changes\nin the packing fraction induce variations in the flow rate. We observe that\nvariations of packing fraction do not affect the velocity of the grains at the\noutlet and, therefore, we establish that flow-rate variations are directly\nrelated to changes in the packing fraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 12:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In the sleep state, the\nprocessor consumes no energy, but a constant wake-up cost is required to\ntransition back to the active state. In contrast to speed scaling alone, the\naddition of a sleep state makes it sometimes beneficial to accelerate the\nprocessing of tasks in order to transition the processor to the sleep state for\nlonger amounts of time and incur further energy savings. The goal is to output\na feasible schedule that minimizes the energy consumption. Since the\nintroduction of the problem by Irani et al. [16], its exact computational\ncomplexity has been repeatedly posed as an open question (see e.g. [2,8,15]).\nThe currently best known upper and lower bounds are a 4/3-approximation\nalgorithm and NP-hardness due to [2] and [2,17], respectively. We close the\naforementioned gap between the upper and lower bound on the computational\ncomplexity of speed scaling with sleep state by presenting a fully\npolynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem. The scheme is based on a\ntransformation to a non-preemptive variant of the problem, and a discretization\nthat exploits a carefully defined lexicographical ordering among schedules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 12:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-04"}

Using results from the literature on diffusion-influenced reactions, we\nderive an analytical expression for the lower bound on the precision of\ntranscriptional regulation. In our theory, transcription factors can perform\nmultiple rounds of 1D diffusion along the DNA and 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm\nbefore binding to the promoter. Comparing our expression for the lower bound on\nthe precision against results from Green's Function Reaction Dynamics\nsimulations shows that the theory is highly accurate under biologically\nrelevant conditions. Our results demonstrate that, to an excellent\napproximation, the promoter switches between the transcription-factor bound and\nunbound state in a Markovian fashion. This remains true even in the presence of\nsliding, i.e. with 1D diffusion along the DNA. This has two important\nimplications: (1) minimizing the noise in the promoter state is equivalent to\nminimizing the search time of transcription factors for their promoters; (2)\nthe complicated dynamics of 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm and 1D diffusion\nalong the DNA can be captured in a well-stirred model by renormalizing the\npromoter association and dissociation rates, making it possible to efficiently\nsimulate the promoter dynamics using Gillespie simulations. Based on the recent\nexperimental observation that sliding can speed up the promoter search by a\nfactor of 4, our theory predicts that sliding can enhance the precision of\ntranscriptional regulation by a factor of 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 12:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-24"}

We\nespecially wish to know when the spin-down flow forced by the mass loss\nsupersedes the baroclinic flows that pervade the radiative envelope of rotating\nstars. We consider a Boussinesq fluid enclosed in a rigid sphere whose flows\nare forced both by the baroclinic torque, the spin-down of an outer layer, and\nan outward mass flux. The spin-down forcing is idealized in two ways: either by\na rigid layer that imposes its spinning down velocity at some interface or by a\nturbulent layer that imposes a stress at this same interface to the interior of\nthe star. In the case where the layer is rigid and imposes its velocity, we\nfind that, as the mass-loss rate increases, the flow inside the star shows two\ntransitions: the meridional circulation associated with baroclinic flows is\nfirst replaced by its spin-down counterpart, while at much stronger mass-loss\nrates the baroclinic differential rotation is superseded by the spin-down\ndifferential rotation. In fact, we find three wind regimes: weak (or no wind),\nmoderate, and strong. In the first case, the flow in the radiative envelope is\nof baroclinic origin. In the moderate case, the circulation results from the\nspin-down while the differential rotation may either be of baroclinic or of\nspin-down origin, depending on the coupling between mass and angular momentum\nlosses. For fast rotating stars, our model says that the moderate wind regime\nstarts when mass loss is higher than ~1e-11 Msun/yr. In the strong wind case,\nthe flow in the radiative envelope is mainly driven by angular momentum\nadvection. This latter transition depends on the mass and the rotation rate of\nthe star, being around 1e-8 Msun/yr for a 3 Msun ZAMS star rotating at 200 km/s\naccording to our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 15:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-15"}

An alternative is to use n-sorters,\ninstead of 2-sorters, as the basic building blocks so as to greatly reduce the\nnumber of sorters as well as the latency. Based on a modified Leighton's\ncolumnsort algorithm, an n-way merging algorithm, referred to as SS-Mk, that\nuses n-sorters as basic building blocks was proposed. In this work, we first\npropose a new multiway merging algorithm with n-sorters as basic building\nblocks that merges n sorted lists of m values each in 1 + ceil(m/2) stages (n\n<= m).

While the asymptotic\ncomplexity (in terms of the required number of sorters) of our sorting\nalgorithm is the same as the SS-Mk, for wide ranges of N, our algorithm\nrequires fewer sorters than the SS-Mk.

Once injected into the interstellar medium (ISM), these stable species\nsurvive and are thus likely to be widespread in the Galaxy where they\ncontribute to interstellar extinction, heating processes, and complex chemical\nreactions. In recent years, the fullerene species C60 (and to a lesser extent\nC70) have been detected in a wide variety of circumstellar and interstellar\nenvironments showing that when conditions are favourable, fullerenes are formed\nefficiently. Fullerenes are the first and only large aromatics firmly\nidentified in space. The detection of fullerenes is thus crucial to provide\nclues as to the key chemical pathways leading to the formation of large complex\norganic molecules in space, and offers a great diagnostic tool to describe the\nenvironment in which they reside.

Whether or not one can find\n(nontrivial) self-extensions of bimodules in all cases is left open.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2014 19:06:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 15:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-02"}

A large class of these\nfunctions emerges in the calculation of massive Feynman diagrams with local\noperator insertions starting at 3-loop order in the coupling constant and\nextends the classes of the nested harmonic, generalized harmonic and cyclotomic\nsums. The binomially weighted sums are associated by the Mellin transform to\niterated integrals over square-root valued alphabets. The values of the sums\nfor $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ and the iterated integrals at $x=1$ lead to new\nconstants, extending the set of special numbers given by the multiple zeta\nvalues, the cyclotomic zeta values and special constants which emerge in the\nlimit $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ of generalized harmonic sums. We develop\nalgorithms to obtain the Mellin representations of these sums in a systematic\nway.

I discuss two situations when a Langmuir\nsoliton can be stable. In the former case the stability of solitons against the\ncollapse is due to electron-electron interactions which result in the nonlocal\nterms in the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. In the latter situation I\nderive the new cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with accounts\nfor the interaction of induced dipole moments of diatomic ions with a rapidly\noscillating electric field and show that the collapse of Langmuir waves can be\nalso arrested.
