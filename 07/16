This is a\nspecial case of stochastic $k$-set packing, where the problem is to find a\nmaximum packing of sets, each of which exists with some probability. In this\npaper, we provide edge and set query algorithms for these two problems,\nrespectively, that provably achieve some fraction of the omniscient optimal\nsolution.\n  Our main theoretical result for the stochastic matching (i.e., $2$-set\npacking) problem is the design of an \\emph{adaptive} algorithm that queries\nonly a constant number of edges per vertex and achieves a $(1-\\epsilon)$\nfraction of the omniscient optimal solution, for an arbitrarily small\n$\\epsilon>0$. Moreover, this adaptive algorithm performs the queries in only a\nconstant number of rounds. We complement this result with a \\emph{non-adaptive}\n(i.e., one round of queries) algorithm that achieves a $(0.5 - \\epsilon)$\nfraction of the omniscient optimum. We also extend both our results to\nstochastic $k$-set packing by designing an adaptive algorithm that achieves a\n$(\\frac{2}{k} - \\epsilon)$ fraction of the omniscient optimal solution, again\nwith only $O(1)$ queries per element.

Furthermore, identifying shocks in hydrodynamical\nsimulations and measuring their Mach number accurately is critical for\ncalculating the production of non-thermal particle components through diffusive\nshock acceleration. However, shocks are often significantly broadened in\nnumerical simulations, making it challenging to implement an accurate shock\nfinder.

We model the star formation history of molecular clumps in equilibrium\nby associating a star formation efficiency (SFE) per free-fall time, \\eff, to\ntheir volume density profile. Our model predicts a steady decline of the star\nformation rate (SFR), which we quantify with its half-life time, namely, the\ntime needed for the SFR to drop to half its initial value.\n  Given the uncertainties affecting the SFE per free-fall time, we consider two\ndistinct values: 0.1 and 0.01. For isothermal spheres, \\eff=0.1 leads to a\nhalf-life time of order the clump free-fall time, \\tff. Therefore, the age\ndistributions of stars formed in high-density clumps have smaller full-widths\nat half-maximum than those of stars formed in low-density clumps. When\n\\eff=0.01, the half-life time is 10 times longer. We explore what happens if\nthe star formation duration is shorter than 10\\tff, that is, if the half-life\ntime of the SFR cannot be defined. There, we build on the invariance of the\nshape of the young cluster mass function to show that an anti-correlation\nbetween clump density and star formation duration is expected. Therefore,\nregardless of whether the star formation duration is longer than the SFR\nhalf-life time, denser molecular clumps yield narrower star age distributions\nin clusters.\n  Published densities and stellar age spreads of young clusters actually\nsuggest that the time-scale for star formation is of order 1-4\\tff.

Exhaustive classifications of\nspin liquids have been carried out in several systems, particularly in the\npresence of full SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry. Real magnetic compounds,\nhowever, generically break SU(2) spin symmetry as a result of spin-orbit\ncoupling - which in many materials provides an `order one' effect. We\ngeneralize previous works by using the projective symmetry group method to\nclassify $Z_2$ spin liquids on the square lattice when SU(2) spin symmetry is\nmaximally lifted. We find that, counterintuitively, the lifting of spin\nsymmetry actually results in vastly more spin liquid phases compared to\nSU(2)-invariant systems. A generic feature of the SU(2)-broken case is that the\nspinons naturally undergo $p+ip$ pairing; consequently, many of these $Z_2$\nspin liquids feature a topologically nontrivial spinon band structure\nsupporting gapless Majorana edge states. We study in detail several spin-liquid\nphases with varying numbers of gapless edge states and discuss their\ntopological protection.

We show that the approach recovers known\nneuron types in the retina and enables predictions of connectivity, better than\nsimpler algorithms. It also can reveal interesting structure in the nervous\nsystem of C. elegans, and automatically discovers the structure of a\nmicroprocessor. Our approach extracts structural meaning from connectomics,\nenabling new approaches of automatically deriving anatomical insights from\nthese emerging datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 20:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

One of their aims has been to replace the\nfirst generation of file sharing software with scalable peer-to-peer\narchitectures. On other fronts, the same techniques are applied, for example,\nto content delivery networks, streaming networks, cooperative caches,\ndistributed file systems, and grid computing architectures for scientific use.\nThis trend has emerged because with cooperative peers it is possible to\nasymptotically enhance the use of resouces in sharing of data compared to the\nbasic client-server architecture.\n  The need for distribution of data is wide and one could argue that it is as\nfundamental a building block as the message passing of the Internet. As an\nanswer to this need a new scalable architecture is introduced: Hybrid\nCommunication Architecture (HCA), which provides both data sharing and message\npassing as communication primitives for applications. HCA can be regarded as an\nabstraction layer for communication which is further encapsulated by a\nhigher-level middleware. HCA is aimed at general use, and it is not designed\nfor any particular application. One key idea is to combine data sharing with\nstreaming since together they enable many applications not easily implementable\nwith only one of these features. For example, a game application could share\nthe game world state between clients and modify it by using streaming. The\nother distinctive feature of the system is the use of knowledge of the physical\nnetwork topology in the optimization of the communication. With a feasible\nbusiness model, fault-tolerance, and security features, HCA is aimed eventually\nfor real-life adoption.\n  This thesis presents the specification of the C++ client interface of HCA and\nthe architecture and protocol of the distributed nodes forming the\nimplementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 21:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

Reaction-diffusion (RD) mechanisms are, however, essential to\nunderstand how shape emerges in the living world. While numerical methods\nconfirm the incredible potential of RD mechanisms to generate patterns, their\nexperimental implementation, despite great efforts, has yet to surpass the\nparadigm of stationary Turing patterns achieved 25 years ago. The principal\nreason for our difficulty to synthesize arbitrary concentration patterns from\nscratch is the lack of fully programmable reaction-diffusion systems. To solve\nthis problem we introduce here a DNA-based system where kinetics and diffusion\ncan be individually tuned. We demonstrate the capability to precisely control\nreaction-diffusion properties with an autocatalytic network that propagates in\na one-dimensional reactor with uniform velocity, typically 100 {\\mu}m min-1.\nThe diffusion coefficient of the propagating species can be reduced up to a\nfactor 2.7 using a species-specific strategy relying on self-assembled\nhydrodynamic drags. Our approach is modular as we illustrate by designing three\nalternative front generating systems, two of which can pass through each other\nwith little interaction. Importantly, the strategies to control kinetics and\ndiffusion are orthogonal to each other resulting in simple programming rules.\nOur results can be quantitatively predicted from first-principle RD equations\nand are in excellent agreement with a generalized Fisher-\nKolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscunov analytical model. Together, these advances open\nthe way for the rational engineering of far-from-equilibrium arbitrary patterns\nand could lead to the synthesis of self-organizing materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 21:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

We initially describe three different cooperative channel sensing\nstrategies with different hard-decision combining algorithms at the ST, namely\nOR, Majority, and AND rules. Since the channel sensing occurs with possible\nerrors, we consider a combined interference power constraint by which the\ntransmission power of the secondary users (SUs) is bounded when the channel is\nsensed as both busy and idle. Furthermore, regarding the channel sensing\ndecision and its correctness, there exist possibly four different transmission\nscenarios. We provide the instantaneous ergodic capacities of the channel\nbetween the ST and each SR in all of these scenarios. Granting that\ntransmission outage arises when the instantaneous transmission rate is greater\nthan the instantaneous ergodic capacity, we establish two different\ntransmission rate policies for the SUs when the channel is sensed as idle. One\nof these policies features a greedy approach disregarding a possible\ntransmission outage, and the other favors a precautious manner to prevent this\noutage. Subsequently, we determine the effective capacity region of this\nchannel model, and we attain the power allocation policies that maximize this\nregion. Finally, we present the numerical results. We first show the\nsuperiority of Majority rule when the channel sensing results are good. Then,\nwe illustrate that a greedy transmission rate approach is more beneficial for\nthe SUs under strict interference power constraints, whereas sending with lower\nrates will be more advantageous under loose interference constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 23:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Calibration is an essential step for these applications. After\ncalibration, we can rectify the captured image by using the calibrated camera\nparameters.

The multi-camera calibration technique usually assumes that the\nworking volume and viewpoints are fixed. In this paper, we describe a\ncalibration algorithm suitable for a mobile camera array based light field\nacquisition system.

Global\noptimization is then applied to refine all the parameters simultaneously. Our\nimplementation is rather flexible in that users can assign the number of\nviewpoints and refinement of intrinsic parameters is optional.

The physics behind the variations\nin fluxes and colors remains unclear. Using SDSS g and r band photometric\nmonitoring data of quasars in Stripe 82, we find that although the flux\nvariation amplitude increases with timescale, the color variability exhibits\nopposite behavior. The color variability of quasars is prominent at timescales\nas short as ~ 10 days, but gradually reduces toward timescales up to years. In\nother words, the variable emission at shorter timescales is bluer than that at\nlonger timescales. This timescale dependence is clearly and consistently\ndetected at all redshifts from z = 0 to 3.5, thus can not be due to\ncontaminations to broadband photometry from emission lines which do not respond\nto fast continuum variations. The discovery directly rules out the possibility\nthat simply attributes the color variability to contamination from a\nnon-variable redder component, such as the host galaxy. It can not be\ninterpreted as changes in global accretion rate either. The thermal accretion\ndisk fluctuation model is favored, in the sense that fluctuations in the inner\nhotter region of the disk are responsible for short term variations, while\nlonger term and stronger variations are expected from larger and cooler disk\nregion. An interesting implication is that one can use quasar variations at\ndifferent timescales to probe disk emission at different radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 08:35:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In the case of session types, developments have been\nmostly framed within quite different type theories for either binary\n(two-party) or multiparty (n-party) protocols. Unfortunately, the precise\nrelationship between analysis techniques for multiparty and binary protocols is\nyet to be understood.\n  In this work, we bridge this previously open gap in a principled way: we show\nthat the analysis of multiparty protocols can also be developed within a much\nsimpler type theory for binary protocols, ensuring protocol fidelity and\ndeadlock-freedom. We present characterization theorems which provide new\ninsights on the relation between two existing, yet very differently motivated,\nsession type systems---one based on linear logic, the other based on automata\ntheory---and suggest useful type-based verification techniques for multiparty\nsystems relying on reductions to the binary case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 09:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

As the evolution proceeds, more unstable matter accumulates and the\nunstable clumps grow in size.

Moreover, velocity-strengthening friction has very\nrecently been linked to slow laboratory earthquakes and stick-slip motion.

Furthermore, we show that different forms of\nvelocity-strengthening friction (e.g. logarithmic vs. linear) may result in\nevents of similar magnitude, yet with dramatically different dissipation and\nradiation rates. This happens because the events are mediated by interfacial\nrupture fronts with vastly different propagation velocities, where stronger\nvelocity-strengthening friction promotes slower rupture.

Earth-directed Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) emanating from the Sun\nare the primary drivers of space weather disturbances. Studies of CMEs, their\nkinematics, and their near-Earth effects are therefore gaining in importance.\n  The effect of CMEs near the Earth is often manifested as transient decreases\nin galactic cosmic ray intensity, which are called Forbush decreases (FDs). In\nthis thesis we probe the structure of CMEs and their associated shocks using FD\nobservations by the GRAPES-3 muon telescope at Ooty. We have established that\nthe cumulative diffusion of galactic cosmic rays into the CME is the dominant\nmechanism for causing FDs (Chapter 3).\n  This diffusion takes place through a turbulent sheath region between the CME\nand the shock. One of our main results concerns the turbulence level in this\nregion. We have quantitatively established that cross-field diffusion aided by\nmagnetic field turbulence accounts for the observed lag between the FD and the\nmagnetic field enhancement of the sheath region (Chapter 4 ).\n  We have also investigated the nature of the driving forces acting on CMEs in\nthis thesis. Using CME data from the SECCHI coronagraphs aboard STEREO\nsapcecraft, we have found evidence for the non-force-free nature of the\nmagnetic field configuration inside these CMEs, which is the basis for the\n(often-invoked) Lorentz self-force driving (Chapter 5).\n  Taken together the work presented in this thesis is a comprehensive attempt\nto characterise CME propagation from typical coronagraph fields of view to the\nEarth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 11:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

The problem, even in a static setting, turns out to be hard\nto solve with conventional optimization methods owing to the consideration of\nvalve-point effects which make the cost function nonsmooth and nonconvex. This\ndifficulty gave rise to the proliferation of population-based global heuristics\nin order to address the multi-extremal and nonsmooth problem. In this paper, we\naddress the economic load dispatch problem (ELDP) with valve-point effect in\nits classic formulation where the cost function for each generator is expressed\nas the sum of a quadratic term and a rectified sine term. We propose two\nmethods that resort to piecewise-quadratic surrogate cost functions, yielding\nsurrogate problems that can be handled by mixed-integer quadratic programming\n(MIQP) solvers. The first method shows that the global solution of the ELDP can\noften be found by using a fixed and very limited number of quadratic pieces in\nthe surrogate cost function. The second method adaptively builds\npiecewise-quadratic surrogate under-estimations of the ELDP cost function,\nyielding a sequence of surrogate MIQP problems. It is shown that any limit\npoint of the sequence of MIQP solutions is a global solution of the ELDP.\nMoreover, numerical experiments indicate that the proposed methods outclass the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in terms of minimization value and computation time\non practical instances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 11:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

The reported effects depend crucially on\nthe coherent nature of the exciting radiation. Achieved with a single (two or\nmore) incident plane wave (waves) the effect carries the name of critical\ncoupling (coherent perfect absorption). Thus in a system supporting critical\ncoupling (CC) or coherent perfect absorption (CPA) all the incident radiation\ncan be absorbed leading to null scattering. In particular all the incident\nlight energy can be channeled into a specified mode of a multimodal structure\nif such modes are supported by the system.

Measurements of cosmological parameters are affected as feedback\nalters the cosmic shear signal on angular scales smaller than a few arcminutes.\nRecent progress on the numerical modelling of baryon physics has shown that\nthis effect could be so large that, rather than being a nuisance, the effect\ncan be constrained with current weak lensing surveys, hence providing an\nalternative astrophysical insight on one of the most challenging questions of\ngalaxy formation. In order to perform our analysis, we construct an analytic\nfitting formula that describes the effect of the baryons on the mass power\nspectrum. This fitting formula is based on three scenarios of the OWL\nhydrodynamical simulations. It is specifically calibrated for $z<1.5$, where it\nmodels the simulations to an accuracy that is better than $2\\%$ for scales\n$k<10 h\\mbox{Mpc}^{-1}$ and better than $5\\%$ for $10 < k < 100\nh\\mbox{Mpc}^{-1}$.

This\ncharacterization is done in terms of a polytope constructed from the set of\nYoung diagrams corresponding to the Schur modules generating the ideal.\n  Our approach consists in computing the test ideals of some invariant ideals\nof S in positive characteristic: Namely, we will compute the test ideals (and\nso the F-pure thresholds) of any sum of products of determinantal ideals.

This representation visualizes in an intuitive way the\nnon-local behavior introduced by cutoffs in momentum space or renormalization\nprocedures that are used to adapt the interaction to low momentum many-body\nHilbert spaces, as done in the unitary correlation operator method or with the\nsimilarity renormalization group. It allows to develop intuition about the\nvarious interactions and illustrates how the softened interactions reduce the\nshort-range repulsion in favor of non-locality or momentum dependence while\nkeeping the scattering phase shifts invariant. It also reveals that these\neffective interactions can have undesired complicated momentum dependencies at\nmomenta around and above the Fermi momentum. Properties, similarities and\ndifferences of the phase-space representations of the Argonne and the N3LO\nchiral potential, and their UCOM and SRG derivatives are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 14:33:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 09:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The calculations are\nlimited to the high temperature phase of the model. It is found that the\nresults are qualitatively different only in a temperature range near the glass\ntransition temperature $T_0$ of the exponential model. While for the Gaussian\nmodel the choice of the dynamical variable that couples to the field has no\nimpact on the shape of the linear response, this is different for the\nexponential model. Here, it is found that also the relaxation time strongly\ndepends on the variable chosen. Furthermore, the modulus of the frequency\ndependent third-order response shows either a peak or exhibits a monotonuous\ndecay from a finite low-frequency limit to a vanishing response at high\nfrequencies depending on the dynamical variable. For variables that give rise\nto a peak in the modulus it is found that its height either increases or\ndecreases as a function of temperature, again depending on the details of the\nchoice of the variable. The peak value of the modulus shows a scaling behavior\nnear $T_0$. It is found that for some variables the low-frequency limit of the\ncubic response diverges at the glass transition temperature and also at a\nfurther temperature determined by the particular variable. A recently proposed\napproximation that relates the cubic response to a four-time correlation\nfunction does not give reliable results due to a wrong estimate of the\nlow-frequency limit of the response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 15:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The one function\nevaluation of the QC/2 algorithm (for any m) represents such a super speedup,\neven over the Grover algorithm in QC/C, that one feels something has gone awry.\nIndeed, our analysis of the transparent calculations of Boolean functions over\nZ_2 shows that the classical algorithm is just repackaged in a rather obvious\nway in the single function evaluation of the QC/2 algorithm--whereas the\ncalculations are hidden and non-transparent in the Grover QC/C algorithm using\nC. The conclusion in both cases (which is rather obvious in the QC/2 case) is\nthat \"counting function evaluations\" is a false coin to measure speedup in the\ncomparison between quantum and classical computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 15:35:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 17:06:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 13:50:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 14:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}

The baryonic component dominates the mass distribution at radii $< 5-10$\nkpc, while the outer distribution is dark matter dominated. We found an\nanti-correlation among the slope $\\alpha$, the effective radius, $R_e$, and the\nBCG mass, and a correlation among the core radius $r_{core}$, and $R_e$.\nMoreover, the mass in 100 kpc (mainly dark matter) is correlated with the mass\ninside 5 kpc (mainly baryons).\n  The behavior of the total mass density profile, the DM density profile, and\nthe quoted correlations can be understood in a double phase scenario. In the\nfirst dissipative phase the proto-BCG forms, and in the second dissipationless\nphase, dynamical friction between baryonic clumps (collapsing to the center)\nand the DM halo flattens the inner slope of the density profile.\n  In simple terms, the large scatter in the inner slope from cluster to\ncluster, and the anti-correlation among the slope, $\\alpha$ and $R_e$ is due to\nthe fact that in order to have a total mass density profile which is NFW-like,\nclusters having more massive BCGs at their centers must contain less DM in\ntheir center. Consequently the inner profile has a flatter slope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 15:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

The flat-rate pricing encourages the\nmaximum usage, while the usage-based pricing can flexibly attract more users\nespecially those with low valuations in mobile Internet access. First, we use\ntheoretical analysis to compare the two schemes and show that for a single\nprovider in a market, as long as the WiFi capacity is abundant, the flat-rate\npricing leads to more revenue. Second, we study how a global provider (e.g.,\nSkype) collaborates with this monopolist in each local market to provide a\nglobal WiFi service. We formulate {the interactions between the global and\nlocal providers as a dynamic game. In Stage I, the global provider bargains\nwith the local provider in each market to determine the global WiFi service\nprice and revenue sharing agreement. In Stage II, local users and travelers\nchoose local or global WiFi services. We analytically show that the global\nprovider prefers to use the usage-based pricing to avoid a severe competition\nwith the local provider. At the equilibrium, the global provider always shares\nthe majority of his revenue with the local provider to incentivize the\ncooperation. Finally, we analytically study how the interaction changes if the\nlocal market has more than one local provider. In this case, the global\nprovider can integrate the coverages of multiple local providers and provide a\nbetter service. Compared to the local monopoly case, local market competition\nenables the global provider to share less revenue with each of the local\nproviders. However, we numerically show that the global provider's revenue\ncould decrease, as he shares his revenue with more providers and can only\ncharge a lower price.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 15:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

There was no considerable charge transfer between OPE\nand fullerene cage, but the fullerene cages had the remarkable minus charges\nmainly due to the electron transfer from RE3N to the cage.

Finally, we show that a gauge-invariant version of the\nchiral Schwinger model, after integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom,\ncan be identified with the two-dimensional Stueckelberg model without the gauge\nfixing term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 06:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-25"}

C. D. Froggatt and H. B.\nNielsen proposed in their book Origin of Symmetries, that symmetries and\nphysical laws should arise naturally from some essentially random dynamics\nrather than being postulated to be exact. The most useful assumption of the\nprogram that can be made about the fundamental laws is taken to be that they\nare random and then to see how known physics like mechanics and relativity\nfollow from them. It is believed that almost any model of these regularities\nwould appear in some limit for example as energies become small. Almost all\ntheories or models at the fundamental level could then explain known physics.\n  We suggest how using the formalism and properties of random graphs might be\nuseful in developing the theory, and point towards directions in which it can\nbe more fully extended in future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 21:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-25"}

Here, we theoretically explore an alternative route to spin\ninjection via the use of dynamically polarized nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in\ndiamond. We focus on the geometry where carriers and NV centers are confined to\nproximate, parallel layers and use a 'trap-and-release' model to calculate the\nspin cross-relaxation probabilities between the charge carriers and neighboring\nNV centers. We identify near-unity regimes of carrier polarization depending on\nthe NV spin state, applied magnetic field, and carrier g-factor. In particular,\nwe find that unlike holes, electron spins are distinctively robust against\nspin-lattice relaxation by other, unpolarized paramagnetic centers. Further,\nthe polarization process is only weakly dependent on the carrier hopping\ndynamics, which makes this approach potentially applicable over a broad range\nof temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 17:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}
