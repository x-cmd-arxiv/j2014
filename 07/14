Recently, it was shown that FFLO superfluids can be realized\nusing a Rashba spin-orbit coupled Fermi gas subject to Zeeman fields, which may\nalso support topological excitations such as Majorana fermions in 2D. Here we\naddress the finite temperature BKT transition issue in this system, which may\nexhibit gapped, gapless, topological, and gapless topological FF phases. We\nfind a large BKT transition temperature due to large effective superfluid\ndensities, making it possible to observe 2D FF superfluids at finite\ntemperature. In addition, we show that gapless FF superfluids can be stable due\nto their positive superfluid densities.

Here, we\npresent three-dimensional (3D) ideal MHD simulationsof the Caltech plasma jet\nexperiment using a magnetic tower scenario as the baseline model. Magnetic\nfields consist of an initially localized dipole-like poloidal component and a\ntoroidal component that is continuously being injected into the domain. This\nflux injection mimics the poloidal currents driven by the anode-cathode voltage\ndrop in the experiment. The injected toroidal field stretches the poloidal\nfields to large distances, while forming a collimated jet along with several\nother key features. Detailed comparisons between 3D MHD simulations and\nexperimental measurements provide a comprehensive description of the interplay\namong magnetic force, pressure and flow effects. In particular, we delineate\nboth the jet structure and the transition process that converts the injected\nmagnetic energy to other forms. With suitably chosen parameters that are\nderived from experiments, the jet in the simulation agrees quantitatively with\nthe experimental jet in terms of magnetic/kinetic/inertial energy, total\npoloidal current, voltage, jet radius, and jet propagation velocity.\nSpecifically, the jet velocity in the simulation is proportional to the\npoloidal current divided by the square root of the jet density, in agreement\nwith both the experiment and analytical theory. This work provides a new and\nquantitative method for relating experiments, numerical simulations and\nastrophysical observation, and demonstrates the possibility of using\nterrestrial laboratory experiments to study astrophysical jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jul 2014 18:17:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-07"}

We select eight SNe in the redshift range\n0.0085 to 0.606, which are firmly associated with GRBs. The light curves of\nthese GRB-SNe are well sampled across the peak.

In the proposed model, the network state consists of flows and\nactivation status of the links. Network dynamics is determined by a, possibly\nstate-dependent and adversarial, disturbance process that reduces flow capacity\non the links, and routing policies at the nodes that have access to the network\nstate, but are oblivious to the presence of disturbance. Under the proposed\ndynamics, a link becomes irreversibly inactive either due to overload condition\non itself or on all of its immediate downstream links. The coupling between\nlink activation and flow dynamics implies that links to become inactive\nsuccessively are not necessarily adjacent to each other, and hence the pattern\nof cascading failure under our model is qualitatively different than standard\ncascade models. The magnitude of a disturbance process is defined as the sum of\ncumulative capacity reductions across time and links of the network, and the\nmargin of resilience of the network is defined as the infimum over the\nmagnitude of all disturbance processes under which the links at the origin node\nbecome inactive. We propose an algorithm to compute an upper bound on the\nmargin of resilience for the setting where the routing policy only has access\nto information about the local state of the network. For the limiting case when\nthe routing policies update their action as fast as network dynamics, we\nidentify sufficient conditions on network parameters under which the upper\nbound is tight under an appropriate routing policy. Our analysis relies on\nmaking connections between network parameters and monotonicity in network state\nevolution under proposed dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 00:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

The key\nfeature of SBS in integrated photonic waveguides is that small, high-contrast\nwaveguides are predicted to experience powerful optical forces on the waveguide\nboundaries, which are predicted to further boost the SBS gain that is already\nexpected to grow dramatically in such structures because of the higher mode\nconfinement alone. In all recent treatments, the effect of radiation pressure\nis included separately from the scattering action that the acoustic field\nexerts on the optical field. In contrast to this, we show here that the effects\nof radiation pressure and motion of the waveguide boundaries are inextricably\nlinked. Central to this insight is a new formulation of the SBS interaction\nthat unifies the treatment of light and sound, incorporating all relevant\ninteraction mechanisms --- radiation pressure, waveguide boundary motion,\nelectrostriction and photoelasticity --- from a rigorous thermodynamic\nperspective. Our approach also clarifies important points of ambiguity in the\nliterature, such as the nature of edge-effects with regard to electrostriction,\nand of body-forces with respect to radiation pressure.

These algorithms not\nonly measure atmospheric scattering, but also recover a more accurate depthmap\nand dehazed image.

Despite\nintensive experimental and theoretical study, it has remained unclear the\nextent to which the hydrodynamic flows generated by swimming cells, rather than\npurely steric interactions between them, drive the self-organization. Here we\nutilize the recent discovery of a spiral-vortex state in confined suspensions\nof \\textit{B. subtilis} to study this issue in detail. Those experiments showed\nthat if the radius of confinement in a thin cylindrical chamber is below a\ncritical value the suspension will spontaneously form a steady single-vortex\nstate encircled by a counter-rotating cell boundary layer, with spiral cell\norientation within the vortex. Left unclear, however, was the flagellar\norientation, and hence the cell swimming direction, within the spiral vortex.\nHere, using a fast simulation method that captures oriented cell-cell and\ncell-fluid interactions in a minimal model of discrete-particle systems, we\npredict the striking, counterintuitive result that in the presence of\ncollectively-generated fluid motion the cells within the spiral vortex actually\nswim upstream against those flows. This is then confirmed by new experiments\nreported here, which include measurements of flagella bundle orientation and\ncell tracking in the self-organized state. These results highlight the complex\ninterplay between cell orientation and hydrodynamic flows in concentrated\nsuspensions of microorganisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 13:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

The model uses a wavefunction that\nis a product of monopole and intrinsic wavefunctions and a constrained\nvariational method to derive, from a many-particle Schrodinger equation, a pair\nof coupled self-consistent cranking-type Schrodinger equations for the monopole\nand intrinsic systems. The monopole co-ordinate used is the trace of the\nquadrupole tensor and hence describes the overall deformation of the nucleus.\nThe monopole and intrinsic wavefunctions are coupled to each other by the two\ncranking equations and their associated parameters and by two constraints\nimposed on the intrinsic system. For an isotropic Nilsson shell model and an\neffective residual two-body interaction, the two coupled cranking equations are\nsolved in the Tamm Dancoff approximation.

These observations, with a 5 sigma\ndetection limit of 2.4 x 10^18 cm^-2 over a 20 km/s linewidth, reveal the\npresence of a low-column density, extended cloud outside the main HI disk,\nabout 17' (~16 kpc or ~2R25) to the NW of the center of the galaxy. The total\nHI mass of the cloud is 6.3 x 10^6 Msun, or 0.15 percent of the total HI mass\nof NGC 2403. The cloud is associated with an 8-kpc anomalous-velocity HI\nfilament in the inner disk, previously observed in deep VLA observations by\nFraternali et al. (2001, 2002). We discuss several scenarios for the origin of\nthe cloud, and conclude that it is either accreting from the intergalactic\nmedium, or is the result of a minor interaction with a neigbouring dwarf\ngalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 13:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

Suppression predictions of quark and gluon jets appear to suggest a\nclear hierarchy according to which neutral pions should be more suppressed than\nD mesons, which in turn should be more suppressed than single electrons.\nHowever, joint comparison of neutral pion (light probe) and non-photonic single\nelectron (heavy probe) suppression data at RHIC unexpectedly showed similar jet\nsuppression for these two probes, which presents the well-known heavy flavor\npuzzle at RHIC. We here analyze which effects are responsible for this\nunexpected result, by using the dynamical energy loss formalism. We find that\nthe main effect is a surprising reversal in the suppression hierarchy between\nneutral pions and D mesons, which is due to the deformation of the suppression\npatterns of light partons by fragmentation functions. Furthermore, we find\nthat, due to the decay functions, the single electron suppression approaches\nthe D meson suppression. Consequently, we propose that these two effects, taken\ntogether, provide a clear intuitive explanation of this longstanding puzzle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 14:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-07"}

We employ an approximation scheme where \"one-loop\" diagrams are\ncomputed using fully dressed gluon and ghost propagators, and tree-level\nvertices. When a suitable kinematical configuration depending on a single\nmomentum scale $p$ is chosen, only two structures emerge: the tree-level\nfour-gluon vertex, and a tensor orthogonal to it. A detailed numerical analysis\nreveals that the form factor associated with this latter tensor displays a\nchange of sign (zero-crossing) in the deep infrared, and finally diverges\nlogarithmically. The origin of this characteristic behavior is proven to be\nentirely due to the masslessness of the ghost propagators forming the\ncorresponding ghost-loop diagram, in close analogy to a similar effect\nestablished for the three-gluon vertex. However, in the case at hand, and under\nthe approximations employed, this particular divergence does not affect the\nform factor proportional to the tree-level tensor, which remains finite in the\nentire range of momenta, and deviates moderately from its naive tree-level\nvalue. It turns out that the kinematic configuration chosen is ideal for\ncarrying out lattice simulations, because it eliminates from the connected\nGreen's function all one-particle reducible contributions, projecting out the\ngenuine one-particle irreducible vertex. Motivated by this possibility, we\ndiscuss in detail how a hypothetical lattice measurement of this quantity would\ncompare to the results presented here, and the potential interference from an\nadditional tensorial structure, allowed by Bose symmetry, but not encountered\nwithin our scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 14:51:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 12:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In\npractice, such classifiers provide a relatively high response at neighbor\nwindows overlapping a pedestrian, while the responses around potential false\npositives are expected to be lower. An analogous reasoning applies for image\nsequences. If there is a pedestrian located within a frame, the same pedestrian\nis expected to appear close to the same location in neighbor frames. Therefore,\nsuch a location has chances of receiving high classification scores during\nseveral frames, while false positives are expected to be more spurious. In this\npaper we propose to exploit such correlations for improving the accuracy of\nbase pedestrian classifiers. In particular, we propose to use two-stage\nclassifiers which not only rely on the image descriptors required by the base\nclassifiers but also on the response of such base classifiers in a given\nspatiotemporal neighborhood. More specifically, we train pedestrian classifiers\nusing a stacked sequential learning (SSL) paradigm. We use a new pedestrian\ndataset we have acquired from a car to evaluate our proposal at different frame\nrates. We also test on a well known dataset: Caltech. The obtained results show\nthat our SSL proposal boosts detection accuracy significantly with a minimal\nimpact on the computational cost. Interestingly, SSL improves more the accuracy\nat the most dangerous situations, i.e. when a pedestrian is close to the\ncamera.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 15:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

This\npaper proposes a generic framework for designing throughput- optimal and\nlow-complexity scheduling algorithms for constrained queueing networks. Under\nour framework, a scheduling algorithm updates current schedules by interacting\nwith a given oracle system that generates an approximate solution to a related\noptimization task. One can utilize our framework to design a variety of\nscheduling algorithms by choosing an oracle system such as random search,\nMarkov chain, belief propagation, and primal-dual methods. The complexity of\nthe resulting scheduling algorithm is determined by the number of operations\nrequired for an oracle to process a single query, which is typically small. We\nprovide sufficient conditions for throughput-optimality of the scheduling\nalgorithm in general constrained queueing network models.

We show that Euclidean\ngeometry can be developed using only intuitionistic logic. We consider three\nversions of Euclid's parallel postulate: Euclid's own formulation in his\nPostulate 5; Playfair's 1795 version, and a new version we call the strong\nparallel postulate. These differ in that Euclid's version and the new version\nboth assert the existence of a point where two lines meet, while Playfair's\nversion makes no existence assertion. Classically, the models of Euclidean\n(straightedge-and-compass) geometry are planes over Euclidean fields. We prove\na similar theorem for constructive Euclidean geometry, by showing how to define\naddition and multiplication without a case distinction about the sign of the\narguments. With intuitionistic logic, there are two possible definitions of\nEuclidean fields, which turn out to correspond to the different versions of the\nparallel axiom. In this paper, we completely settle the questions about\nimplications between the three versions of the parallel postulate: the strong\nparallel postulate easily implies Euclid 5, and in fact Euclid 5 also implies\nthe strong parallel postulate, although the proof is lengthy, depending on the\nverification that Euclid 5 suffices to define multiplication geometrically. We\nshow that Playfair does not imply Euclid 5, and we also give some other\nindependence results. Our independence proofs are given without discussing the\nexact choice of the other axioms of geometry; all we need is that one can\ninterpret the geometric axioms in Euclidean field theory. The proofs use Kripke\nmodels of Euclidean field theories based on carefully constructed rings of\nreal-valued functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jul 2014 23:41:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2015 14:39:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-03"}

Here we exhibit three constructive versions of Tarski's theory.\nOne, like Tarski's theory, has existential axioms and no function symbols. We\nthen consider a version in which function symbols are used instead of\nexistential quantifiers. The third version has a function symbol for the\nintersection point of two non-parallel, non-coincident lines, instead of only\nfor intersection points produced by Pasch's axiom and the parallel axiom; this\nchoice of function symbols connects directly to ruler-and-compass\nconstructions. All three versions have this in common: the axioms have been\nmodified so that the points they assert to exist are unique and depend\ncontinuously on parameters. This modification of Tarski's axioms, with\nclassical logic, has the same theorems as Tarski's theory, but we obtain\nresults connecting it with ruler-and-compass constructions as well. In\nparticular, points constructively proved to exist can be constructed with ruler\nand compass, uniformly in parameters; the same is true with non-constructive\nproofs if several constructions are allowed for different cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Jul 2014 23:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 18:20:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2015 20:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}
