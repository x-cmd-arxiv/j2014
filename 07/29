Since cooperation of\nnodes is essential for routing protocols, various methods have been proposed to\nstimulate cooperation among selfish nodes. In order to provide sufficient\nincentives, most of these methods pay nodes a premium over their actual costs\nof participation. However, they lead to considerably large overpayments.\nMoreover, existing methods ignore mobility of nodes, for simplicity. However,\nowing to the mobile nature of MANETs, this assumption seems unrealistic. In\nthis paper, we propose an optimal game theoretical framework to ensure the\nproper cooperation in mobility aware routing for MANETs. The proposed method is\nbased on the multi-dimensional optimal auctions which allows us to consider\npath durations, in addition to the route costs. Path duration is a metric that\nbest reflects changes in topology caused by mobility of nodes and, it is widely\nused in mobility aware routing protocols. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism\nis optimal in that it minimizes the total expected payments. We provide\ntheoretical analysis to support our claims.

In particular, we focus on a specific form of deadlock\nwhich is useful for the cache coherence protocol domain and consistent with the\ninternal definition of deadlock in the Murphi model checker: we refer to this\ndeadlock as a system- wide deadlock (s-deadlock). In s-deadlock, the entire\nsystem gets blocked and is unable to make any transition. Cache coherence\nprotocols consist of N symmetric cache agents, where N is an unbounded\nparameter; thus the verification of s-deadlock freedom is naturally a\nparameterized verification problem. Parametrized verification techniques work\nby using sound abstractions to reduce the unbounded model to a bounded model.\nEfficient abstractions which work well for industrial scale protocols typically\nbound the model by replacing the state of most of the agents by an abstract\nenvironment, while keeping just one or two agents as is. However, leveraging\nsuch efficient abstractions becomes a challenge for s-deadlock: a violation of\ns-deadlock is a state in which the transitions of all of the unbounded number\nof agents cannot occur and so a simple abstraction like the one above will not\npreserve this violation. In this work we address this challenge by presenting a\ntechnique which leverages high-level information about the protocols, in the\nform of message sequence dia- grams referred to as flows, for constructing\ninvariants that are collectively stronger than s-deadlock. Efficient\nabstractions can be constructed to verify these invariants. We successfully\nverify the German and Flash protocols using our technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 16:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}

Nevertheless, some questions are still open and new ones\nstem from the continuous improvements in the diagnostic imaging techniques.\nMany of these unresolved issues are related to the three-dimensional structure\nof the left-ventricular flow during the cardiac cycle. In this paper we\ninvestigated in detail this aspect using a laboratory model. The ventricle was\nsimulated by a flexible sack varying its volume in time according to a\nphysiologically shaped law. Velocities measured during several cycles on series\nof parallel planes, taken from two orthogonal points of view, were combined\ntogether in order to reconstruct the phase averaged, three-dimensional velocity\nfield. During the diastole, three main steps are recognized in the evolution of\nthe vortical structures: i) straight propagation in the direction of the long\naxis of a vortex-ring originated from the mitral orifice; ii) asymmetric\ndevelopment of the vortex-ring on an inclined plane; iii) single vortex\nformation. The analysis of three-dimensional data gives the experimental\nevidence of the reorganization of the flow in a single vortex persisting until\nthe end of the diastole.

The first part of this work studies the\ninduction of decision trees and the construction of ensembles of randomized\ntrees, motivating their design and purpose whenever possible.

One\nappealing approach is the L0 regularized regression which penalizes the number\nof nonzero features in the model directly. L0 is known as the most essential\nsparsity measure and has nice theoretical properties, while the popular L1\nregularization is only a best convex relaxation of L0. Therefore, it is natural\nto expect that L0 regularized regression performs better than LASSO. However,\nit is well-known that L0 optimization is NP-hard and computationally\nchallenging. Instead of solving the L0 problems directly, most publications so\nfar have tried to solve an approximation problem that closely resembles L0\nregularization.\n  In this paper, we propose an efficient EM algorithm (L0EM) that directly\nsolves the L0 optimization problem. $L_0$EM is efficient with high dimensional\ndata. It also provides a natural solution to all Lp p in [0,2] problems. The\nregularized parameter can be either determined through cross-validation or AIC\nand BIC. Theoretical properties of the L0-regularized estimator are given under\nmild conditions that permit the number of variables to be much larger than the\nsample size. We demonstrate our methods through simulation and high-dimensional\ngenomic data. The results indicate that L0 has better performance than LASSO\nand L0 with AIC or BIC has similar performance as computationally intensive\ncross-validation.

The bright and\nwell studied HAT-P-7 system is intriguing as several Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM)\nmeasurements found a large projected obliquity in this system, but it was so\nfar not possible to determine if the orbit is polar and/or retrograde. The goal\nof this study is to measure the stellar inclination and hereby the full 3D\nobliquity of the HAT-P-7 system instead of only the 2D projection as measured\nby the RM effect. In addition we provide an updated set of stellar parameters\nfor the star. We use the full set of available observations from Kepler\nspanning Q0-Q17 to produce the power spectrum of HAT-P-7. We extract\noscillation mode frequencies via an MCMC peak-bagging routine, and use the\nresults from this to estimate the stellar inclination angle. Combining this\nwith the projected obliquity from RM and the inclination of the orbital plane\nallows us to determine the stellar obliquity. We use asteroseismology to model\nthe star from the extracted frequencies using two different approaches to the\nmodelling where either the MESA or the GARSTEC stellar evolution codes are\nadopted. Using our updated asteroseismic modelling we find, i.a., the following\nstellar parameters for HAT-P-7: M=1.51{+0.04}{-0.05}Msun,\n$R=2.00{+0.01}{-0.02}Rsun, and age = 2.07{+0.28}{-0.23} Gyr. Our asteroseismic\nmodelling offers a high precision on the stellar parameters, for instance is\nthe uncertainty on age of the order ~11%. For the stellar inclination we\nestimate i_star<36.5 deg., which translates to an obliquity between 83 and 111\ndeg.

Using first principles based density functional\ntheory calculations, we show that the band gap of few layers of MoS$_2$ can be\ntuned by applying i) normal compressive (NC), ii) biaxial compressive (BC), and\niii) biaxial tensile (BT) strain. A reversible semiconductor to metal\ntransition (S-M transition) is observed under all three types of strain. In the\ncase of NC strain, the threshold strain at which S-M transition occurs\nincreases with increasing number of layers and becomes maximum for the bulk. On\nthe other hand, the threshold strain for S-M transition in both BC and BT\nstrain decreases with the increase in number of layers. The difference in the\nmechanisms for the S-M transition is explained for different types of applied\nstrain. Furthermore, the effect of strain type and number of layers on the\ntransport properties are also studied using Botzmann transport theory. We\noptimize the transport properties as a function of number of layers and applied\nstrain. 3L- and 2L-MoS$_2$ emerge as the most efficient thermoelectric material\nunder NC and BT strain, respectively. The calculated thermopower is large and\ncomparable to some of the best thermoelectric materials.

Using 3D high-resolution simulations, we probe the impact of\nrotation on the hot and cold accretion flow in a typical massive galaxy. In the\nhot mode, with or without turbulence, the pressure-dominated flow forms a\ngeometrically thick rotational barrier, suppressing the accretion rate to ~1/3\nof the Bondi rate. When radiative cooling is dominant, the gas loses pressure\nsupport and quickly circularizes in a cold thin disk. In the more common state\nof a turbulent and heated atmosphere, CCA drives the dynamics if the gas\nvelocity dispersion exceeds the rotational velocity, i.e., turbulent Taylor\nnumber < 1. Extended multiphase filaments condense out of the hot phase via\nthermal instability and rain toward the black hole, boosting the accretion rate\nup to 100 times the Bondi rate. Initially, turbulence broadens the angular\nmomentum distribution of the hot gas, allowing the cold phase to condense with\nprograde or retrograde motion. Subsequent chaotic collisions between the cold\nfilaments, clouds, and a clumpy variable torus promote the cancellation of\nangular momentum, leading to high accretion rates. The simulated sub-Eddington\naccretion rates cover the range inferred from AGN cavity observations. CCA\npredicts inner flat X-ray temperature and $r^{-1}$ density profiles, as\nrecently discovered in M 87 and NGC 3115. The synthetic H{\\alpha} images\nreproduce the main features of cold gas observations in massive ellipticals, as\nthe line fluxes and the filaments versus disk morphology. Such dichotomy is key\nfor the long-term AGN feedback cycle. As gas cools, filamentary CCA develops\nand boosts AGN heating; the cold mode is thus reduced and the rotating disk\nremains the sole cold structure. Its consumption leaves the atmosphere in hot\nmode with suppressed accretion and feedback, reloading the cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 20:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 14:58:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

Warm Dark Matter (WDM) and\nSelf-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) are currently the favorite alternative\nmodels to CDM. Constraints on the WDM particle mass require it to be so heavy\nthat WDM is nearly indistinguishable from CDM. The best observational test of\nSIDM is likely to be in the dark matter distribution of faint dwarf galaxies,\nbut there is a lack of theoretical predictions for galaxy structure in SIDM\nthat account for the role of baryons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 20:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-30"}

To\nfacilitate a meaningful comparison, we consider a fixed mass of 60 solar masses\n(Msun) incorporated in Pop III stars, either contained in a single star, or\nsplit up in binary stars of 30 Msun each or an asymmetric case of one 45 Msun\nand one 15 Msun star. Whereas the sizes of the resulting HII regions are\ncomparable across all cases, the HeIII regions around binary stars are\nsignificantly smaller than that of the single star. Consequently, the He$^{+}$\n1640 angstrom recombination line is expected to become much weaker. Supernova\nfeedback exhibits great variety due to the uncertainty in possible explosion\npathways. If at least one of the component stars dies as a hypernova about ten\ntimes more energetic than conventional core-collapse supernovae, the gas inside\nthe host minihalo is effectively blown out, chemically enriching the\nintergalactic medium (IGM) to an average metallicity of $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ solar\nmetallicity (Zsun), out to $\\sim 2$ kpc. The single star, however, is more\nlikely to collapse into a black hole, accompanied by at most very weak\nexplosions. The effectiveness of early chemical enrichment would thus be\nsignificantly reduced, in difference from the lower mass binary stars, where at\nleast one component is likely to contribute to heavy element production and\ndispersal. Important new feedback physics is also introduced if close binaries\ncan form high-mass x-ray binaries, leading to the pre-heating and -ionization\nof the IGM beyond the extent of the stellar HII regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 20:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 22:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

An extension to this picture is to model dark energy as a\nscalar field coupled directly to cold dark matter. This coupling leads to new\nphysical effects, such as a fifth-force and a time-dependent dark matter\nparticle mass. In this work we examine the impact that coupling has on weak\nlensing statistics by constructing realistic simulated weak-lensing maps using\nraytracing techniques through N-body cosmological simulations.

Primarily, we\nfollow a dissimilarity representation based approach; we embed the input data\ninto the dissimilarity space by means of an appropriate parametric\ndissimilarity measure. This step allows us to process virtually any type of\ndata. The dissimilarity vectors are then represented through a weighted\nEuclidean graphs, which we use to (i) determine the entropy of the data\ndistribution in the dissimilarity space, and at the same time (ii) derive\neffective decision regions that are modeled as clusters of vertices. Since the\ndissimilarity measure for the input data is parametric, we optimize its\nparameters by means of a global optimization scheme, which considers both\nmesoscopic and structural characteristics of the data represented through the\ngraphs. The proposed one-class classifier is designed to provide both hard\n(Boolean) and soft decisions about the recognition of test patterns, allowing\nan accurate description of the classification process.

With observational gene\nexpression data, many methods discover causal variables by measuring each\nvariable's degree of statistical dependence with the target using dependence\nmeasures (DMs). However, other methods measure each variable's ability to\nexplain the statistical dependence between the target and the remaining\nvariables in the data using conditional dependence measures (CDMs), since this\nstrategy is guaranteed to find the target's direct causes, direct effects, and\ndirect causes of the direct effects in the infinite sample limit. In this\npaper, we design a new algorithm in order to systematically compare the\nrelative abilities of DMs and CDMs in discovering causal variables from gene\nexpression data.\n  Results: The proposed algorithm using a CDM is sample efficient, since it\nconsistently outperforms other state-of-the-art local causal discovery\nalgorithms when samples sizes are small. However, the proposed algorithm using\na CDM outperforms the proposed algorithm using a DM only when sample sizes are\nabove several hundred. These results suggest that accurate causal discovery\nfrom gene expression data using current CDM-based algorithms requires datasets\nwith at least several hundred samples.\n  Availability: The proposed algorithm is freely available at\nhttps://github.com/ericstrobl/DvCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 20:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-30"}

The energy\ncurrent is defined by the continuity equation for the energy density which is\nderived both for homogeneous as well as for inhomogeneous systems. Since the\ntotal energy is not conserved in the driven system, the continuity equation\nincludes the source terms which are shown to represent the Joule heating\neffects. For short times and weak drivings the energy current agrees with the\nlinear response theory. For stronger fields or longer times of driving the\nsystem enters the quasiequilibrium regime when the energy current gradually\ndiminishes due to the heating effects. Finally, for even stronger driving the\nenergy current is shown to undergo a damped Bloch oscillations. The energy\nspread also increases upon driving.

However, these state-transfer protocols suffer\nfrom dephasing and dissipation. In this thesis we go beyond the standard\nopen-systems treatment of quantum dissipation allowing us to consider\nnon-Markovian environments. We use adiabatic perturbation theory in order to\ngive analytic descriptions for various quantum state-transfer protocols. The\nleading-order corrections will give rise to additional terms adding to the\ngeometric phase preventing us from achieving a perfect fidelity. We obtain\nanalytical descriptions for the effects of the geometric phase in non-Markovian\nregimes. The Markovian regime is usually treated by solving a standard\nBloch-Redfield master equation, while in the non-Markovian regime, we perform a\nsecular approximation allowing us to obtain a solution to the density matrix\nwithout solving master equations. This solution contains all the relevant phase\ninformation for our state-transfer protocol. After developing the general\ntheoretical tools, we apply our methods to adiabatic state transfer between a\nfour-level atom in a driven cavity.

Different features can have different value ranges and some form of a\nfeature scaling is often required in order to learn an accurate classifier.\nHowever, feature scaling is conducted as a preprocessing task prior to\nlearning. This is problematic in an online setting because of two reasons.\nFirst, it might not be possible to accurately determine the value range of a\nfeature at the initial stages of learning when we have observed only a few\nnumber of training instances. Second, the distribution of data can change over\nthe time, which render obsolete any feature scaling that we perform in a\npre-processing step. We propose a simple but an effective method to dynamically\nscale features at train time, thereby quickly adapting to any changes in the\ndata stream. We compare the proposed dynamic feature scaling method against\nmore complex methods for estimating scaling parameters using several benchmark\ndatasets for binary classification.

We focus on a simple model for this\npurpose: a deterministic two-hop interference channel, where feedback comes\nfrom overhearing the forward-links. A new aspect brought by this setup is the\ndual-role of the relay signal. While the relay signal needs to convey the\nsource message to its corresponding destination, it can also provide a feedback\nsignal which can potentially increase the capacity of the first hop.

High quality spectra have been used to\nderive their surface abundances of O, Fe, Mg, Si, and Ca, which are assumed to\nbe 0.1-0.15 dex less than their initial abundances due to the effects of\ndiffusion.

We assume that the resource is being sold in a sealed-bid second-price\nauction that solicits bids for the entire resource.

The $2^t$-ary method is\nthe most popular and widely used algorithm to speed up the RSA signature\nprocess. Developers can realize the fastest signature process by choosing\noptimum $t$. For example, $t=6$ is optimum for a 1536-bit classical RSA\nimplementation. The $2^t$-ary method requires precomputation to generate small\nexponentials of message. Conventional fault attack research has paid little\nattention to precomputation, even though precomputation could be a target of a\nfault attack. The proposed DCA induces faults in precomputation by using\ninstruction skip technique, which is equivalent to replacing an instruction\nwith a no operation in assembly language.

In this manuscript we present a\nmodel for these mechanical displacements as arising from the driving of surface\nwave modes in which potential energy is stored in elastic properties of the\nneuronal membrane and cytoskeleton while kinetic energy is carried by the\naxoplasmic fluid. In our model these surface waves are driven by the traveling\nwave of electrical depolarization that characterizes the AP, altering the\ncompressive electrostatic forces across the membrane as it passes. This driving\nleads to co-propagating mechanical displacements, which we term Action Waves\n(AWs). Our model for these AWs allows us to predict, in terms of elastic\nconstants, axon radius and axoplasmic density and viscosity, the shape of the\nAW that should accompany any traveling wave of voltage, including the AP\npredicted by the Hodgkin and Huxley (HH) equations. We show that our model\nmakes predictions that are in agreement with results in experimental systems\nincluding the garfish olfactory nerve and the squid giant axon.

This implies the existence of a parent population of sources\nwith a misaligned jet, that have been identified with low-power radiogalaxies.\nThe spectrum of BL Lacs, dominated by non-thermal emission over the whole\nelectromagnetic range, together with bright compact radio cores, high\nluminosities, rapid and large amplitude flux variability at all frequencies and\nstrong polarization make these sources an optimal laboratory for high energy\nastrophysics.

In this paper we review the main observational facts that\ncontribute to the present basic interpretation of this class of active\ngalaxies.

The simulations are confirmed by the observation of\nfully polarized and narrowband single photon emission from the tetrapods at\nroom temperature. The single photon emission provides important insights\ntowards understanding the quantum confinement effects in non-spherical\nnanostructures.

In this paper,\nwe propose a simple yet effective algorithm for outlier detection and robust\nQoE evaluation named iterative Least Trimmed Squares (iLTS). The algorithm\nassigns binary weights to samples, i.e., 0 or 1 indicating if a sample is an\noutlier, then the outlier-trimmed subset least squares solutions give robust\nranking scores. An iterative optimization is carried alternatively between\nupdating weights and ranking scores which converges to a local optimizer in\nfinite steps.

Moreover, a varied version\nof this method shows adaptation in outlier detection, which provides an\nautomatic detection to determine whether a data sample is an outlier without\n\\emph{a priori} knowledge about the amount of the outliers.

We postulate that only the Glauber effect\nassociated with a pion is significant, due to its special role as a $q \\bar q$\nbound state and as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson simultaneously. Treating the\nGlauber phases as additional inputs in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach, we\nfind a good fit to all the $B \\to \\pi\\pi$, $\\pi\\rho$, $\\pi\\omega$, and $\\pi K$\ndata, and resolve the long-standing $\\pi\\pi$ and $\\pi K$ puzzles.

The main goal is to compare and\ncontrast the phase separation in two and three dimensions, using\nhigh-resolution numerical simulation as the basis for the study. The model flow\nis parametrized by its amplitudes (thereby admitting the possibility of\nanisotropy), lengthscales, and multiple time scales, and the outcome of the\nphase separation is investigated as a function of these parameters as well as\nthe dimensionality. In this way, a parameter regime is identified wherein the\nphase separation and the associated coarsening phenomenon are not only arrested\nbut in fact the concentration variance decays, thereby opening up the\npossibility of describing the dynamics of the concentration field using the\ntheories of advection diffusion. This parameter regime corresponds to long flow\ncorrelation times, large flow amplitudes and small diffusivities. The onset of\nthis hyperdiffusive regime is interpreted by introducing Batchelor\nlengthscales. A key result is that in the hyperdiffusive regime, the\ndistribution of concentration (in particular, the frequency of extreme values\nof concentration) depends strongly on the dimensionality. Anisotropic scenarios\nare also investigated: for scenarios wherein the variance saturates\n(corresponding to coarsening arrest), the direction in which the domains align\ndepends on the flow correlation time. Thus, for correlation times comparable to\nthe inverse of the mean shear rate, the domains align in the direction of\nmaximum flow amplitude, while for short correlation times, the domains\ninitially align in the opposite direction. However, at very late times (after\nthe passage of thousands of correlation times), the fate of the domains is the\nsame regardless of correlation time, namely alignment in the direction of\nmaximum flow amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 09:06:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 17:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-23"}

By performing a large\nnumber of N-body simulations, we show that the total mass of the initial\npopulation had to be significantly larger than the masses of the two planets,\nand that the two planets must have built-up farther away than their present\nlocation, at a distance of at least a few au from the central star. The planets\nhad to grow fast enough so that they would detach themselves from the\npopulation of remaining, less massive, cores and migrate in to their present\nlocation. By the time the other cores migrated in, the disc's inner edge would\nhave moved out so that these cores cannot be detected today. We also compute\nthe critical core mass beyond which a massive gaseous envelope would be\naccreted and show that it is larger than 17 Earth masses if the planetesimal\naccretion rate onto the core is larger than 10^{-6} Earth mass per year.

Our main goal is to construct an inflationary model which not only\npredicts the important cosmological quantities such as $(n_s, r)$ compatible\nwith experimental observation, but also is consistent with the low energy\neffective theory framework. Therefore, all the fundamental scale apart from\n$M_p$ and quantities of our interest should be within the sub-Planckian region.\nIn order to achieve our goal we modify the usual single field natural\ninflationary model by a specific form of higher derivative kinetic term called\nkinetic gravity braiding (KGB). One of our guiding principles to construct such\na model is the constant shift symmetry of the axion. We have chosen the form of\nthe KGB term in such a way that it predicts the required value of $n_s\\simeq\n0.96$ and a large tensor to scalar ratio $r> 0.1$. Importantly for a wide range\nof parameter space our model has sub-Planckian axion decay constant $f$ and the\nscale of inflation $\\Lambda$. However, the reheating after the end of inflation\nlimits the value of $f$ so that we are unable to get $f$ to be significantly\nlower than $M_p$. Furthermore, we find sub-Planckian field excursion for the\naxion field $\\Delta \\phi \\simeq f$ for the sufficient number of e-folding\n${\\cal N} \\gtrsim 50 $.

However, when we enter the\nquantum domain this approach starts being problematic as the standard kinds of\namplifiers are usually accompanied by excess noise which detrimentally affects\nthe quantum features of used states. Recently, several kinds of \"noiseless\"\namplifiers that do not suffer from this feature have been proposed. Among these\namplifiers, one that stands out is the noise powered amplifier, which acts\nincoherently, amplifying the signal by adding the \"right\" kind of noise. Here\nwe show that despite the incoherence, which makes the amplifier unsuitable for\nprotocols such as entanglement distillation, the added noise is not a big\nproblem in quantum key distribution tasks and can be in some situations\nbeneficial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 11:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-30"}

The dust temperature\nvariations are caused by rotation of hot and dense material of the spiral shock\nwave in the disk central gap. The aim of this work is to show how different can\nbe the Class II methanol maser brightness in the disk during the Moment of\nMaximum Illumination by the Spiral Shock material (hereafter MMISS) and the\nMoment when the disk is Illuminated by the Stars Only (MISO). We used the code\nCLOUDY (v13.02) to estimate physical conditions in the flat disk in the MISO\nand the MMISS. Model physical parameters of the disk were then used to estimate\nthe brightness of 6.7, 9.9, 12.1 and 107 GHz masers at different impact\nparameters $p$ using LVG approximation. It was shown that the strong masers\nexperience considerable brightness increase during the MMISS with respect to\nMISO.

Ideally, the results would indicate the\nuse of micro cavitation as a more efficient alternative to underwater vehicle\ndepth control than the conventional ballast tank method.

In this work we investigate the\nsuitability of the fabrication method for the electrical excitation of colour\ncentres in diamond. Differently from photoluminescence, electroluminescence\nrequires an electrical current flowing through the diamond sub-gap states for\nthe excitation of the colour centres. With this purpose, buried graphitic\nelectrodes with a spacing of 10 micrometers were fabricated in the bulk of a\ndetector-grade CVD single-crystal diamond sample using a scanning 1.8 MeV He\nmicro-beam. The current flowing in the gap region between the electrodes upon\nthe application of a 250 V bias voltage was exploited as the excitation pump\nfor the electroluminescence of different types of colour centres localized in\nthe above-mentioned gap. The bright light emission was spatially mapped using a\nconfocal optical microscopy setup. The spectral analysis of electroluminescence\nrevealed the emission from neutrally-charged nitrogen-vacancy centres ($NV^0$,\n$\\lambda_{ZPL}$ = 575 nm), as well as from cluster crystal dislocations\n(A-band, {\\lambda} = 400-500 nm). Moreover, an electroluminescence signal with\nappealing spectral features (sharp emission at room temperature, low phonon\nsidebands) from He-related defects was detected ($\\lambda_{ZPL}$ = 536.3 nm,\n$\\lambda_{ZPL}$ = 560.5 nm); a low and broad peak around {\\lambda} = 740 nm was\nalso observed and tentatively ascribed to Si-V or GR1 centres. These results\npose interesting future perspectives for the fabrication of\nelectrically-stimulated single-photon emitters in diamond for applications in\nquantum optics and quantum cryptography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 13:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

For any such game that is also large, we solve the\nequilibrium selection problem in a strong sense. In particular, we give an\nefficient weak mediator: a mechanism which has only the power to listen to\nreported types and provide non-binding suggested actions, such that (a) it is\nan asymptotic Nash equilibrium for every player to truthfully report their type\nto the mediator, and then follow its suggested action; and (b) that when\nplayers do so, they end up coordinating on a particular asymptotic pure\nstrategy Nash equilibrium of the induced complete information game. In fact,\ntruthful reporting is an ex-post Nash equilibrium of the mediated game, so our\nsolution applies even in settings of incomplete information, and even when\nplayer types are arbitrary or worst-case (i.e. not drawn from a common prior).\nWe achieve this by giving an efficient differentially private algorithm for\ncomputing a Nash equilibrium in such games. The rates of convergence to\nequilibrium in all of our results are inverse polynomial in the number of\nplayers $n$. We also apply our main results to a multi-dimensional market game.\n  Our results can be viewed as giving, for a rich class of games, a more robust\nversion of the Revelation Principle, in that we work with weaker informational\nassumptions (no common prior), yet provide a stronger solution concept (ex-post\nNash versus Bayes Nash equilibrium).

We say that\na group $G$ is \\emph{co$\\mathcal{CF}$} if its co-word problem with respect to\nsome (equivalently, any) finite generating set $\\Sigma$ is a context-free\nlanguage.\n  We describe a generalized Thompson group $V_{(G, \\theta)}$ for each finite\ngroup G and homomorphism $\\theta$: $G \\rightarrow G$. Our group is constructed\nusing the cloning systems introduced by Witzel and Zaremsky. We prove that\n$V_{(G, \\theta)}$ is co$\\mathcal{CF}$ for any homomorphism $\\theta$ and finite\ngroup G by constructing a pushdown automaton and showing that the co-word\nproblem of $V_{(G, \\theta)}$ is the cyclic shift of the language accepted by\nour automaton.\n  A version of a conjecture due to Lehnert says that a group has context-free\nco-word problem exactly if it is a finitely generated subgroup of V. The groups\n$V_{(G,\\theta)}$ where $\\theta$ is not the identity homomorphism do not appear\nto have obvious embeddings into V, and may therefore be considered possible\ncounterexamples to the conjecture.\n  Demonstrative subgroups of $V$, which were introduced by Bleak and\nSalazar-Diaz, can be used to construct embeddings of certain wreath products\nand amalgamated free products into $V$. We extend the class of known finitely\ngenerated demonstrative subgroups of V to include all virtually cyclic groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 14:53:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 20:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-04"}

A distinct gravitationally self-bound solitonic core is found at the\ncenter of every halo, with a profile quite different from cores modeled in the\nwarm or self-interacting dark matter scenarios. Furthermore, we show that each\nsolitonic core is surrounded by an extended halo composed of large fluctuating\ndark matter granules which modulate the halo density on a scale comparable to\nthe diameter of the solitonic core. The scaling symmetry of the SP equation and\nthe uncertainty principle tightly relate the core mass to the halo specific\nenergy, which, in the context of cosmological structure formation, leads to a\nsimple scaling between core mass ($M_c$) and halo mass ($M_h$), $M_c \\propto\na^{-1/2} M_h^{1/3}$, where $a$ is the cosmic scale factor.

This 90-90-90 target would mean that, by\n2020, 90% of all those living with HIV should know their status, 90% of these\nwould be on treatment and 90% of these would have fully suppressed plasma viral\nloads. To reach this target in the next five years presents a major logistical\nchallenge. However, the prevalence of HIV varies greatly by risk groups, age,\ngender, geography and social conditions. For reasons of effectiveness and\nimpact the focus must first be on those who are most likely to be infected with\nHIV and therefore most likely to infect others. In Kenya the prevalence of HIV\nin adults varies by two orders of magnitude among the counties. The effective\nimplementation of 90-90-90 will depend on first providing ART where the\nprevalence of infection is greatest, then to those that are most easily reached\nin large numbers and finally to the whole population. Here we use routine data\nfrom ante-natal clinics and national survey data to assess the variation of the\nprevalence of HIV among counties in Kenya; we suggest reasons for this\nvariation, and estimate the effectiveness of targeting the role out of ART. The\nhighest prevalence occurs in some of the counties bordering Lake Victoria and\nthese are most in need of ART. These districts in Nyanza Province, account for\n31% of all cases in Kenya but make up 10% of the population and cover 1.8% of\nthe land-area. The highest concentrations of HIV cases are in Nairobi and\nMombasa which account for a further 18% of all cases in Kenya but make up 12%\nof the population and cover 0.1% of the land-area. Providing ART in these two\ncities will be relatively straightforward given their small geographical area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 16:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-30"}

The modified Psi-formalism developed here discards the\noriginal constraints of zero-vorticity by allowing for vertical vorticity which\nis the case of most interest for coastal dynamics. The problem is reformulated\nin terms of two dynamical equations on the boundary supplemented by one\nequation that represents a kinematic constraint in the interior of the domain.\nIn this framework, the kinematic constraint can be solved to express Psi in\nterms of canonically-conjugated variables. The formalism is demonstrated for\nhorizontally homogeneous flows over mild topography, where asymptotic\nformulations for the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian functions are derived based on\nthe Helmholz-Hodge decomposition. For potential flows, the asymptotic form of\nthe Hamiltonian is identical to previous results. The Lagrangian function is\nalso expressed as an expansion in terms of the surface height and its time\nderivative and compared with Zakharov's formalism where agreement is found for\none-dimensional wave scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 19:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-30"}
