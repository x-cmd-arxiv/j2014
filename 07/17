The main new result is\nthat the zeros on the critical line are in one-to-one correspondence with the\nzeros of the cosine function, and this leads to a transcendental equation for\nthe $n$-th zero on the critical line that depends only on $n$. If there is a\nunique solution to this equation for every $n$, then if $N_0 (T)$ is the number\nof zeros on the critical line, then $N_0(T) = N(T)$, i.e. all zeros are on the\ncritical line.

While long-standing\ntheoretical approaches have addressed the problem of inter-filament forces from\nthe limit of infinitely rigid rods, the ability of flexible filaments to deform\nintra-filament shape in response to changes in inter-filament geometry has a\nprofound affect on the nature of cohesive interactions. In this paper, we study\ntwo theoretical models of inter-filament cohesion in the opposite limit, in\nwhich filaments are sufficiently flexible to maintain cohesive contact along\ntheir contours, and address, in particular, the role played by\nhelical-interfilament geometry in defining interactions. Specifically, we study\nmodels of featureless, tubular filaments interacting via 1) pair-wise\nLennard-Jones (LJ) interactions between surface elements and 2)\ndepletion-induced filament binding stabilized by electrostatic surface\nrepulsion. Analysis of these models reveals a universal preference for cohesive\nfilament interactions for non-zero helical skew, and further, that in the\nasymptotic limit of vanishing interaction range relative to filament diameter,\nthe skew-dependence of cohesion approaches a geometrically defined limit\ndescribed purely by the close-packing geometry of twisted tubular filaments. We\nfurther analyze non-universal features of the skew-dependence of cohesion at\nsmall-twist for both potentials, and argue that in the LJ model the pair-wise\nsurface attraction generically destabilizes parallel filaments, while in the\nsecond model, pair-wise electrostatic repulsion in combination with\nnon-pairwise additivity of depletion leads to a meta-stable parallel state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 16:15:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 19:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We also check that the instability in the sector of\nflexural phonons takes place without the development of an in-plane static\ndistortion, which is avoided due to the significant reduction of the\nelectron-phonon couplings for in-plane phonons at large momenta.

At\nlow radio frequencies (<100 MHz), the Sun has not been imaged extensively\nbecause of the instrumental limitations of previous radio telescopes. Here, the\ncombined high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution of the Low Frequency\nArray (LOFAR) was used to study solar Type III radio bursts at 30-90 MHz and\ntheir association with CMEs. The Sun was imaged with 126 simultaneous\ntied-array beams within 5 solar radii of the solar centre. This method offers\nbenefits over standard interferometric imaging since each beam produces high\ntemporal (83 ms) and spectral resolution (12.5 kHz) dynamic spectra at an array\nof spatial locations centred on the Sun. LOFAR's standard interferometric\noutput is currently limited to one image per second. Over a period of 30\nminutes, multiple Type III radio bursts were observed, a number of which were\nfound to be located at high altitudes (4 solar radii from the solar center at\n30 MHz) and to have non-radial trajectories. These bursts occurred at altitudes\nin excess of values predicted by 1D radial electron density models. The\nnon-radial high altitude Type III bursts were found to be associated with the\nexpanding flank of a CME. The CME may have compressed neighbouring streamer\nplasma producing larger electron densities at high altitudes, while the\nnon-radial burst trajectories can be explained by the deflection of radial\nmagnetic fields as the CME expanded in the low corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 16:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

The model\nexhibits two branches of the critical curve crossing in a transcritical\nbifurcation scenario. We discuss two thresholds due to immediate and delayed\nexchange of stability effects; and we derive algebraic relationships for\nparameters of the periodic solution in the limit of the infinite ratio of the\ntime scales. Flukes parasitise cockles and in turn are hyperparasitised by the\nmicrosporidian Unikaryon legeri; the life cycle of flukes includes several life\nstages and a number of different hosts.

A population dynamics\nmodel which accounts for such multi-species interactions and includes the\nfluke-hyperparasite model in a cockle as a subsystem is presented. We provide\nevidence that the threshold effect we observed in the flukes-hyperparasite\nsubsystem remains apparent in the multi-species system. Assuming that flukes\ndamage cockles, and taking into account that the hyperparasite is detrimental\nto flukes, it is natural to suggest that the hyperparasitism may support the\nabundance of cockles and, thereby, the persistence of the ecosystem, including\nshellfish and birds.

EXCEDE is a 0.7m space telescope concept designed\nto achieve raw contrasts of 1e6 at an inner working angle of 1.2 l/D and 1e7 at\n2 l/D and beyond. This will allow it to directly detect and spatially resolve\nlow surface brightness circumstellar debris disks as well as image giant\nplanets as close as in the habitable zones of their host stars. In addition to\ndoing fundamental science on debris disks, EXCEDE will also serve as a\ntechnological and scientific precursor for any future exo-Earth imaging\nmission. EXCEDE uses a Starlight Suppression System (SSS) based on the PIAA\ncoronagraph, enabling aggressive performance.\n  We report on our continuing progress of developing the SSS for EXCEDE, and in\nparticular (a) the reconfiguration of our system into a more flight-like\nlayout, with an upstream deformable mirror and an inverse PIAA system, as well\nas a LOWFS, and (b) testing this system in a vacuum chamber, including IWA,\ncontrast, and stability performance. The results achieved so far are 2.9e-7\ncontrast between 1.2-2.0 l/D and 9.7e-8 contrast between 2.0-6.0 l/D in\nmonochromatic light; as well as 1.4e-6 between 2.0-6.0 l/D in a 10% band, all\nwith a PIAA coronagraph operating at an inner working angle of 1.2 l/D. This\nconstitutes better contrast than EXCEDE requirements (in those regions) in\nmonochromatic light, and progress towards requirements in broadband light. Even\nthough this technology development is primarily targeted towards EXCEDE, it is\nalso germane to any exoplanet direct imaging space-based telescopes because of\nthe many challenges common to different coronagraph architectures and mission\nrequirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 17:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We extend our sample to\nhigh redshifts (z > 1) by including 35 (sub)-millimeter selected dusty star\nforming galaxies from the literature with robust CO observations. The addition\nof luminous starbursts at high redshifts enlarge the range of the FIR-CO\nluminosity relations towards the high-IR-luminosity end while also\nsignificantly increasing the small amount of mid-/high-J CO line data available\nprior to Herschel. This new data-set (both in terms of IR luminosity and\nJ-ladder) reveals linear FIR-CO luminosity relations ($\\alpha \\sim 1$) for\nJ=1-0 up to J=5-4, with a nearly constant normalisation ($\\beta \\sim 2$).

A key observation in indoor environment is that distinct functional\nareas are typically controlled by separate HVAC and lighting systems and room\nlevel localization is sufficient to provide a powerful tool for energy usage\nreduction by occupancy-based actuation of the building facilities. Based upon\nthis observation, this paper focuses on identifying the room where a person or\na mobile device is physically present. Existing room localization methods,\nhowever, require special infrastructure to annotate rooms.\n  SoundLoc is a room-level localization system that exploits the intrinsic\nacoustic properties of individual rooms and obviates the needs for\ninfrastructures. As we show in the study, rooms' acoustic properties can be\ncharacterized by Room Impulse Response (RIR). Nevertheless, obtaining precise\nRIRs is a time-consuming and expensive process. The main contributions of our\nwork are the following. First, a cost-effective RIR measurement system is\nimplemented and the Noise Adaptive Extraction of Reverberation (NAER) algorithm\nis developed to estimate room acoustic parameters in noisy conditions. Second,\na comprehensive physical and statistical analysis of features extracted from\nRIRs is performed. Also, SoundLoc is evaluated using the dataset consisting of\nten (10) different rooms.

Often, one uses inverse probability weighted (IPW)\nestimators to estimate population effects in such studies. However, these\nestimators are inefficient relative to estimators that make additional\nassumptions about the data generating mechanism. We propose a class of\nestimators for the effect of risk factors on a secondary outcome in\ncase-control studies, when the mean is modeled using either the identity or the\nlog link. The proposed estimator combines IPW with a mean zero control function\nthat depends explicitly on a model for the primary disease outcome. The\nefficient estimator in our class of estimators reduces to standard IPW when the\nmodel for the primary disease outcome is unrestricted, and is more efficient\nthan standard IPW when the model is either parametric or semiparametric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 18:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

Principal Component Analysis (PCA), is the classical way of\ndimensional reduction. However, traditional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\nbased PCA fails to model data which largely deviates from Gaussian\ndistribution. The Bregman Divergence was recently introduced to achieve a\ngeneralized PCA framework. If the random variable under dimensional reduction\nfollows Bernoulli distribution, which occurs in many emerging fields, the\ngeneralized PCA is called Logistic PCA (LPCA). In this paper, we extend the\nbatch LPCA to a sequential version (i.e. SLPCA), based on the sequential convex\noptimization theory. The convergence property of this algorithm is discussed\ncompared to the batch version of LPCA (i.e. BLPCA), as well as its performance\nin reducing the dimension for multivariate binary-state systems. Its\napplication in building energy end-use profile modeling is also investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 19:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

The majority of the\nrefractory elements are produced in supernova explosions but it is unclear how\nand where dust grains condense and grow, and how they avoid destruction in the\nharsh environments of star-forming galaxies. The recent detection of 0.1-0.5\nsolar masses of dust in nearby supernova remnants suggests in situ dust\nformation, while other observations reveal very little dust in supernovae the\nfirst few years after explosion. Observations of the bright SN 2010jl have been\ninterpreted as pre-existing dust, dust formation or no dust at all. Here we\nreport the rapid (40-240 days) formation of dust in its dense circumstellar\nmedium.

We use the adaptive mesh refinement code Enzo to simulate the\ncollapse of gas at high redshift, including a nine species chemical model of H,\nHe, and H$_2$. The direct collapse model requires that the gas cools\npredominantly via atomic hydrogen. To this end we simulate the effect of an\nanisotropic radiation source on the collapse of a halo at high redshift. The\nradiation source is placed at a distance of 3 kpc (physical) from the\ncollapsing object. The source is set to emit monochromatically in the center of\nthe Lyman-Werner (LW) band only at $12.8 \\ \\rm{eV}$. The LW radiation emitted\nfrom the high redshift source is followed self-consistently using ray tracing\ntechniques. We find that, due to self-shielding, a small amount of H$_2$ is\nable to form at the very center of the collapsing halo even under very strong\nLW radiation. Furthermore, we find that a radiation source, emitting $>\n10^{54}\\ (\\sim10^3\\ \\rm{J_{21}})$ photons per second is required to cause the\ncollapse of a clump of $\\rm{M \\sim 10^5}$ M$_{\\odot}$.

Similar strong correlations can affect or even destabilize\nthe two-dimensional metallic state of topological origin at the crystal\nboundary. Here we construct the minimal lattice model of the correlated\nboundary of topological Kondo insulators, and make phenomenological predictions\nfor its possible ground states. Depending on the microscopic properties of the\ninterface between the topological Kondo material and a conventional insulator,\nthe boundary metal can exhibit a varied degree of hybridization between the $d$\nand $f$ orbitals of the rare earth element, yielding a rich two-dimensional\nheavy fermion phenomenology. A pronounced participation of the $f$ orbitals is\nexpected to create a heavy fermion Dirac metal, possibly unstable to a spin\ndensity wave, electron localization or even superconductivity. The opposite\nlimit of \"localized magnetic moments\" helped by the partial Kondo screening on\nthe crystal boundary can bring about a non-Fermi liquid of $d$ electrons that\nexhibits two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics, or other unconventional\nstates. In addition, ultra-thin films made from topological Kondo insulators\ncould open the possibility of creating exotic incompressible quantum liquids\nwith non-Abelian fractional excitations, whose dynamics shaped by the strong\nRashba spin-orbit coupling resembles that of fractional quantum Hall systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 20:08:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 00:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

An open question about\ncollisionless shocks is whether electrons and ions each establish their own\npost-shock temperature, or whether they quickly equilibrate in the shock\nregion. Here we provide simple relations for the minimal amount of\nequilibration to expect. The basic assumption is that the enthalpy-flux of the\nelectrons is conserved separately, but that all particle species should undergo\nthe same density jump across the the shock. This assumption results in an\nanalytic treatment of electron-ion equilibration that agrees with observations\nof collisionless shocks: at low Mach numbers ($<2$) the electrons and ions are\nclose to equilibration, whereas for Mach numbers above $M \\sim 60$ the\nelectron-ion temperature ratio scales with the particle masses $T_e/T_i =\nm_e/m_i$. In between these two extremes the electron-ion temperature ratio\nscales as $T_e/T_i \\propto 1/M_s^2$. This relation also hold if adiabatic\ncompression of the electrons is taken into account. For magnetised plasmas the\ncompression is governed by the magnetosonic Mach number, whereas the\nelectron-ion temperatures are governed by the sonic Mach number. The derived\nequations are in agreement with observational data at low Mach numbers, but for\nsupernova remnants the relation requires that the inferred Mach numbers for the\nobservations are over- estimated, perhaps as a result of upstream heating in\nthe cosmic-ray precursor.

By analyzing these effects and the strength of the\nformalism to distinguish between different reaction mechanisms in benchmark\nreactions involving $^{40}$K and $^{87}$Rb species, we argue that statistical\npredictions will help understanding product formation and control, and lead\ndevelopments to realize the full potential of ultracold chemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 21:27:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 2014 14:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

These data indicate that the Moon and\nthe terrestrial planets have been bombarded by two populations of objects.\nPopulation 1, dominating at early times, had nearly the same size distribution\nas the present-day asteroid belt, and produced the heavily cratered surfaces\nwith a complex, multi-sloped crater size-frequency distribution. Population 2,\ndominating since about 3.8-3.7 Ga, has the same size distribution as near-Earth\nobjects (NEOs), had a much lower impact flux, and produced a crater size\ndistribution characterized by a differential -3 single-slope power law in the\ncrater diameter range 0.02 km to 100 km. Taken together with the results from a\nlarge body of work on age-dating of lunar and meteorite samples and theoretical\nwork in solar system dynamics, a plausible interpretation of these data is as\nfollows. The NEO population is the source of Population 2 and it has been in\nnear-steady state over the past ~3.7-3.8 gigayears; these objects are derived\nfrom the main asteroid belt by size-dependent non-gravitational effects that\nfavor the ejection of smaller asteroids. However, Population 1 were main belt\nasteroids ejected from their source region in a size-independent manner,\npossibly by means of gravitational resonance sweeping during giant planet orbit\nmigration; this caused the so-called Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). The LHB\nbegan some time before ~3.9 Ga, peaked and declined rapidly over the next ~100\nto 300 megayears, and possibly more slowly from about 3.8-3.7 Ga to ~2 Ga. A\nthird crater population (Population S) consists of secondary impact craters\nthat can dominate the cratering record at small diameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 22:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Simultaneously, we test the current calibrations of Te and luminosity for\nthe Ap/Bp star members, and identify clearly blue stragglers in the clusters\nstudied. Methods: We explore the possibility that isochrone fitting in the\ntheoretical Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (i.e. log (L/L&sun;) vs. log Te),\nrather than in the conventional colour-magnitude diagram, can provide more\nprecise and accurate cluster ages, with well-defined uncertainties.

Our age determinations are all within the range of previously\ndetermined values, but the associated uncertainties are considerably smaller\nthan the spread in recent age determinations from the literature. Furthermore,\nexamination of proper motions and HR diagrams confirms that the Ap stars\nidentified in these clusters are members, and that the presently accepted\ntemperature scale and bolometric corrections for Ap stars are approximately\ncorrect.

Jet veto introduces a second mass\nscale pT(veto) to the problem in addition to the invariant mass of the WW pair.\nThis gives rise to large logarithms of the ratio of the two scales that need to\nbe resummed. Such resummation may not be properly accounted for by the Monte\nCarlo simulations used in the ATLAS and CMS studies. Those logarithms are also\naccompanied by large pi^2 terms when the standard, positive sign is chosen for\nthe squared renormalization scale. We analytically resum the large logarithms\nincluding the pi^2 terms in the framework of soft collinear effective theory\n(SCET), and demonstrate that the SCET calculation not only reduces the scale\nuncertainties of the SM prediction significantly but also renders the theory\nprediction well compatible with the experiment. We find that resummation of the\nlarge logarithms and that of the pi^2 terms are both comparably important.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 02:07:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 15:52:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 15:48:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 17:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-07"}

Lei et al. (2013a, 2013b) studied the effect of this kind of\nwind on HB morphology in details, and their results indicated that binary is a\npossible secondparameter (2P) candidate in GCs. Binary fraction is an very\nimportant fact in the tidally-enhanced-stellar-wind model. In this paper, we\nstudied the effect of binary fraction on HB morphology by removing the effects\nof metallicity and age. Five different binary fractions (i.e., 10%, 15%, 20%,\n30% and 50%) are adopted in our model calculations. The synthetic HB\nmorphologies with different binary fractions are obtained at different\nmetallicities and ages. We found that, due to the great influence of\nmetallicity and age, the effect of binary fraction on HB morphology may be\nmasked by these two parameters. However, when the effects of metallicity and\nage are removed, the tendency that HB morphologies become bluer with increasing\nof binary fractions is clearly presented. Furthermore, we compared our results\nwith the observation by Milone et al. (2012). Our results are consistent well\nwith the observation at metalrich and metal-poor GCs. For the GCs with\nintermediate metallicity, when the effect of age on HB morphology is removed, a\nweak tendency that HB morphologies become bluer with increasing of binary\nfractions is presented in all regions of GCs, which is consistent with our\nresults obtained in this metallicity range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 02:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This suggests that some fraction of young binary systems which\npossess massive circumbinary disks (CB) may be in the midst of planet\nformation. However, there are very few CB disks detected. We revisit one of the\nknown CB disks, the UY Aurigae system, and probe 13CO 2-1, C18O 2-1, SO\n5(6)-4(5) and 12CO 3-2 line emission and the thermal dust continuum. Our new\nresults confirm the existence of the CB disk. In addition, the circumstellar\n(CS) disks are clearly resolved in dust continuum at 1.4 mm. The spectral\nindices between the wavelengths of 0.85 mm and 6 cm are found to be\nsurprisingly low, being 1.6 for both CS disks. The deprojected separation of\nthe binary is 1.26\" based on our 1.4 mm continuum data. This is 0.07\" (10 AU)\nlarger than in earlier studies. Combining the fact of the variation of UY Aur B\nin $R$ band, we propose that the CS disk of an undetected companion UY Aur Bb\nobscures UY Aur Ba. A very complex kinematical pattern inside the CB disk is\nobserved due to a mixing of Keplerian rotation of the CB disk, the infall and\noutflow gas. The streaming gas accreting from the CB ring toward the CS disks\nand possible outflows are also identified and resolved. The SO emission is\nfound to be at the bases of the streaming shocks. Our results suggest that the\nUY Aur system is undergoing an active accretion phase from the CB disk to the\nCS disks.

Super-AGB stars are expected to\nhave slow winds with high mass-loss rates, so their wind density is high. The\nexplosions of super-AGB stars are therefore presumed to occur in this dense\nwind. We provide the first synthetic light curves (LCs) for such events by\nexploding realistic electron-capture supernova (ecSN) progenitors within their\nsuper-AGB winds. We find that the early LC, i.e. before the recombination wave\nreaches the bottom of the H-rich envelope of SN ejecta (the plateau phase), is\nnot affected by the dense wind. However, after the plateau phase, the\nluminosity remains higher when the super-AGB wind is taken into account. We\ncompare our results to the historical LC of SN 1054, the progenitor of the Crab\nNebula, and show that the explosion of an ecSN within an ordinary super-AGB\nwind can explain the LC features. We conclude that SN 1054 could have been a\nType IIn SN without any extra extreme mass loss which was previously suggested\nto be necessary to account for its early high luminosity. We also show that our\nLCs match Type IIn SNe with an early plateau phase (`Type IIn-P') and suggest\nthat they are ecSNe within super-AGB winds. Although some ecSNe can be bright\nin the optical spectral range due to the large progenitor radius, their X-ray\nluminosity from the interaction does not necessarily get as bright as other\nType IIn SNe whose optical luminosities are also powered by the interaction.\nThus, we suggest that optically-bright X-ray-faint Type IIn SNe can emerge from\necSNe. Optically-faint Type IIn SNe, such as SN 2008S, can also originate from\necSNe if their H-rich envelope masses are small. Some of them can be observed\nas `Type IIn-b' SNe due to the small H-rich envelope mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 05:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-02"}

Fine scale structures in\nsunspots, called umbral dots (UDs), have become one of the hottest topics in\nterms of the close observation of the magnetoconvection.\n  In this paper, a brief review of observed properties of UDs is given based on\nthe recent literature. UDs born in the periphery of the umbra exhibit inward\nmigration, and their speeds are positively correlated with the magnetic field\ninclination. Longer-lasting UDs are tend to be larger and brighter, while\nlifetimes of UDs show no relation with their background magnetic field\nstrength. UDs tend to disappear or stop its proper motion by colliding with the\nlocally strong field region. The spatial distribution of UD is not uniform over\nan umbra but is preferably located at boundaries of cellular patterns. From our\n2-dimensional correlation analysis, we measured the characteristic width of the\ncell boundaries (~0.5\") and the size of the cells (~6\").\n  Then we performed a simplified analysis to get statistics how the UD\ndistribution is random or clustered using the Hinode blue continuum images.

However, there are\nintermediate regimes when only the electron beam size or the electron beam\ndivergence dominate. In this asymptotic cases the geometrical optics approach\nis still applicable, and the brightness definition used here yields back once\nmore the maximum photon flux density in phase space. In these intermediate\nregimes we find a significant numerical disagreement between exact calculations\nand the approximation for undulator brightness currently used in literature. We\nextend the WD formalism to a satisfactory theory for the brightness of a\nbending magnet. We find that in the intermediate regimes the usually accepted\napproximation for bending magnet brightness turns out to be inconsistent even\nparametrically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 07:50:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-18"}

Depending on the\ncriticality index of the situation, the system should dynamically focus or\nwiden its analysis and reasoning scope. A naive -why have less when you can\nhave more- approach would consist in systematically sampling the context at a\nvery high rate and triggering the reasoning process regularly. This reasoning\nprocess would then need to mine a huge amount of data, extract a relevant view,\nand finally analyze this adequate view. This overall process would require some\nheavy resources and/or be time-consuming, conflicting with the (near) real-time\nresponse time requirements of intelligent systems. We claim that a continuous\nand more flexible navigation into context models, in space and in time, can\nsignificantly improve reasoning processes. This paper thus introduces a novel\nmodeling approach together with a navigation concept, which consider time and\nlocality as first-class properties crosscutting any model element, and enable\nthe seamless navigation of models in this space-time continuum. In particular,\nwe leverage a time-relative navigation (inspired by the space-time and\ndistortion theory [7]) able to efficiently empower continuous reasoning\nprocesses. We integrate our approach into an open-source modeling framework and\nevaluate it on a smart grid reasoning engine for electric load prediction.

All\ncurrent experimental programs to search for neutrinoless double beta decay are\nfacing with the technical and financial challenge of increasing the\nexperimental mass while maintaining incredibly low levels of spurious\nbackground. The new concept described in this paper could be the answer which\ncombines all the features of an ideal experiment: energy resolution, low cost\nmass scalability, isotope choice flexibility and many powerful handles to make\nthe background negligible. The proposed technology is based on the use of\narrays of silicon detectors cooled to 120 K to optimize the collection of the\nscintillation light emitted by ultra-pure crystals. It is shown that with a 54\nkg array of natural CaMoO4 scintillation detectors of this type it is possible\nto yield a competitive sensitivity on the half-life of the neutrinoless double\nbeta decay of 100Mo as high as ~10E24 years in only one year of data taking.\nThe same array made of 40CaMoO4 scintillation detectors (to get rid of the\ncontinuous background coming from the two neutrino double beta decay of 48Ca)\nwill instead be capable of achieving the remarkable sensitivity of ~10E25 years\non the half-life of 100Mo neutrinoless double beta decay in only one year of\nmeasurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 09:18:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The probability of using a specific word in a sentence strongly\ndepends on the 'history' of word-usage earlier in that sentence. We study a\nsimple history-dependent model of text generation assuming that the\nsample-space of word usage reduces along sentence formation, on average. We\nfirst show that the model explains the approximate Zipf law found in word\nfrequencies as a direct consequence of sample-space reduction. We then\nempirically quantify the amount of sample-space reduction in the sentences of\nten famous English books, by analysis of corresponding word-transition tables\nthat capture which words can follow any given word in a text. We find a highly\nnested structure in these transition tables and show that this `nestedness' is\ntightly related to the power law exponents of the observed word frequency\ndistributions. With the proposed model it is possible to understand that the\nnestedness of a text can be the origin of the actual scaling exponent, and that\ndeviations from the exact Zipf law can be understood by variations of the\ndegree of nestedness on a book-by-book basis. On a theoretical level we are\nable to show that in case of weak nesting, Zipf's law breaks down in a fast\ntransition. Unlike previous attempts to understand Zipf's law in language the\nsample-space reducing model is not based on assumptions of multiplicative,\npreferential, or self-organised critical mechanisms behind language formation,\nbut simply used the empirically quantifiable parameter 'nestedness' to\nunderstand the statistics of word frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 09:38:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 07:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

This allows\nus to determine the scale height with a 25% accuracy for samples of 38 clusters\nor more. We apply our method to investigate the temporal evolution of cluster\nscale height, using homogeneously selected sub-samples of Kharchenko et al.\n(MWSC), Dias et al.

The scale height increases\nfrom about 40pc at 1Myr to 75pc at 1Gyr, most likely due to internal evolution\nand external scattering events. After 1Gyr, there is a marked change of the\nbehaviour, with the scale height linearly increasing with log(age/yr) to about\n550pc at 3.5Gyr. The most likely interpretation is that the surviving clusters\nare only observable because they have been scattered away from the mid-plane in\ntheir past. A detailed understanding of this observational evidence can only be\nachieved with numerical simulations of the evolution of cluster samples in the\nGalactic Disk.\n  Furthermore, we find a weak trend of an age-independent increase in scale\nheight with galactocentric distance.

It is apparently centred on the young\nstellar cluster -whose most massive representative is the triple system HR8119-\ninside the HII region Sh 2-129. The driving source, the nature, and the\ndistance of Ou4 are not known. Deep narrow-band imagery of the whole nebula at\narcsec resolution was obtained to study its morphology. Long-slit spectroscopy\nof the tips of the bipolar lobes was secured to determine the gas ionization\nmechanism, physical conditions, and line-of-sight velocities. An estimate of\nthe proper motions at the tip of the south lobe using archival images is\nattempted. The existing multi-wavelength data for Sh 2-129 and HR 8119 are also\ncomprehensively reviewed. The morphology of Ou4, its emission-line spatial\ndistribution, line flux ratios, and the kinematic modelling adopting a\nbow-shock parabolic geometry, illustrate the expansion of a shock-excited fast\ncollimated outflow. The radial velocities and reddening are consistent with\nthose of Sh 2-129 and HR 8119. The improved determination of the distance to\nHR8119 (composed of two B0 V and one B0.5 V stars) and Sh 2-129 is 712 pc. We\nidentify in WISE images a 5 arcmin-radius (1 pc at the distance above) bubble\nof emission at 22 micron emitted by hot (107 K) dust, located inside the\ncentral part of Ou4 and corresponding to several [O III] features of Ou4. The\napparent position and the properties studied in this work are consistent with\nthe hypothesis that Ou4 is located inside the Sh 2-129 HII region, suggesting\nthat it was launched some 90 000 yrs ago by HR8119. The outflow total kinetic\nenergy is estimated to be ~4e47~ergs. However, the alternate possibility that\nOu4 is a bipolar planetary nebula, or the result of an eruptive event on a\nmassive AGB or post-AGB star not yet identified, cannot be ruled out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 10:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}

In\ndirected multiplex networks, we distinguish a set of different giant components\nbased on the existence of directed paths of different types between their\nvertices, such that for each type of edges, the paths run entirely through only\nedges of that type. If, in particular, $m=2$, we define a strongly viable\ncomponent as a set of vertices, in which for each type of edges, each two\nvertices are interconnected by at least two directed paths in both directions,\nrunning through the edges of only this type. We show that in this case, a\ndirected multiplex network contains, in total, $9$ different giant components\nincluding the strongly viable component.

While Paper I concentrated on deriving age,\nmass, and extinction of star clusters for one fixed metallicity, we here derive\nthese parameters in case when metallicity is let free to vary. The results were\nobtained using several different filter systems ($UBVRI$, $UBVRIJHK$,\nGALEX+$UBVRI$), which allowed to optimally reduce the different degeneracies\nbetween the cluster physical parameters. The age, mass, and extinction of a\nsample of artificial star clusters were derived by comparing their broad-band\nintegrated magnitudes with the magnitudes of a large grid of cluster models\nwith various metallicities. A large collection of artificial clusters was\nstudied to model the different degeneracies in the age, mass, extinction, and\nmetallicity parameter space when stochasticity is taken into account in the\ncluster models. We show that, without prior knowledge on the metallicity, the\noptical bands ($UBVRI$) fail to allow a correct derivation of the age, mass,\nand extinction because of the strong degeneracies between models of different\nmetallicities. Adding near-infrared information ($UBVRI$+$JHK$) slightly helps\nin improving the parameter derivation, except for the metallicity. Adding\nultraviolet data (GALEX+$UBVRI$) helps significantly in deriving these\nparameters and allows constraining the metallicity when the photometric errors\nhave a Gaussian distribution with standard deviations 0.05 mag for $UBVRI$ and\n0.15 mag for the GALEX bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 11:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-10"}

We present a theoretical study of the IR spectra\nof PAHs containing (5,7)-member ring defects, focusing on pyrene and coronene.\nUsing density functional theory, we investigate the effects of such defects on\nthe IR spectra of pyrene and coronene and their cations and anions. In\naddition, we explore parts of the potential energy surface of the neutral\nspecies and discuss alternative formation pathways. The addition of\n(5,7)-membered ring defects in pyrene and coronene results in a change of the\nIR spectra, both molecules lose their typical spectroscopic signature. We find\nshifts in the positions of the band as well as different intensities and a rise\nin the number of features.

Investigation of\nthe minimal energy pathway leads to a result of 8.21 eV for pyrene and 8.41 eV\nfor coronene as minimum activation barriers for the transformation from ground\nstate to defected state. Whereas pyrene retains some of its symmetry due to the\nsymmetry exhibited by the Stone-Wales defect itself, coronene loses much more\nof its symmetry. The formation of these (5,7)-ring defects in PAHs may be well\nsupported in AGB stars or PNe. Those environments strongly enable the\ntransition from the ground state to the defect state.

In this thesis, I\nanalyze the role of the prior information available in facing such problems,\nand consider scenarios where the information regarding the possible states is\nincomplete. In front of a complete ignorance of the possible states' identity,\nI discuss a quantum \"programmable\" discrimination machine for qubit states that\naccepts this information as input programs using a quantum encoding, rather\nthan as a classical description. The optimal performance of these machines is\nstudied for general qubit states when several copies are provided, in the\nschemes of unambiguous, minimum-error, and error-margin discrimination. Then,\nthis type of automation in discrimination tasks is taken further. By realizing\na programmable machine as a device that is trained through quantum information\nto perform a specific task, I propose a quantum \"learning\" machine for\nclassifying qubit states that does not require a quantum memory to store the\nqubit programs and, nevertheless, performs as good as quantum mechanics\npermits. Such learning machine thus allows for several optimal uses with no\nneed for retraining. A similar learning scheme is also discussed for coherent\nstates of light.

An\nalternative statement of the theorem is that terminating reduction relations\nare precisely those having a \"disjunctively well-founded transition invariant\".\nFrom this result the same authors and Byron Cook designed an algorithm checking\na sufficient condition for termination for a while-if program. The algorithm\nlooks for a disjunctively well-founded transition invariant, made of\nwell-founded relations of height omega, and if it finds it, it deduces the\ntermination for the while-if program using the Termination Theorem.\n  This raises an interesting question: What is the status of reduction\nrelations having a disjunctively well-founded transition invariant where each\nrelation has height omega? An answer to this question can lead to a\ncharacterization of the set of while-if programs which the termination\nalgorithm can prove to be terminating.

Besides, if all the relations in the transition invariant are\nprimitive recursive and the reduction relation is the graph of the restriction\nto some primitive recursive set of a primitive recursive map, then a final\nstate is computable by some primitive recursive map in the initial state.\n  As a corollary we derive that the set of functions, having at least one\nimplementation in Podelski Rybalchenko while-if language with a well-founded\ndisjunctively transition invariant where each relation has height omega, is\nexactly the set of primitive recursive functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 14:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-18"}

They all coincide in\nthe Keplerian case. Such a degeneracy is removed, in general, when a\npost-Keplerian acceleration is present. We analytically work out the\ncorrections to such otherwise Keplerian periods which are induced by general\nrelativity (Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring) and, at the Newtonian level, by\nthe quadrupole of the primary. In many astronomical and astrophysical systems,\nlike exoplanets, one of the most accurately determined quantities is just the\ntime span characterizing the orbital revolution, which is often measured\nindependently with different techniques like the transit photometry and the\nradial velocities. Thus, our results could be useful, in principle, to either\nconstrain the physical properties of the central body and/or perform new tests\nof general relativity, especially when no other standard observables like,\ne.g., the orbital precessions are accessible to observations. The difference of\ntwo independently measured periods would cancel out the common Keplerian term\nleaving just a post-Keplerian correction. Furthermore, by comparing the\ntheoretically predicted post-Keplerian expressions $T^{(\\textrm{pK})}$ with the\nexperimental accuracy $\\sigma_{T_\\textrm{exp}}$ in measuring the orbital\nperiod(s) it is possible to identify those systems whose observations should be\nre-processed with genuine post-Keplerian models if\n$T^{(\\textrm{pK})}>\\sigma_{T_\\textrm{exp}}$. It seems just the case for WASP-33\nb since $\\sigma_{T_\\textrm{exp}}=0.04$ s, while $3$ s$\\leq\nT_\\textrm{dra}^{(J_2)}\\leq 9.5$ s, $T_\\textrm{dra}^{(\\textrm{GE)}}=0.36$ s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 15:04:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 18:10:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 14:31:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 19:31:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

In this paper, we show that, to the first post-Newtonian level,\nthere is also a gravitolectric clock effect induced by the static component of\nthe gravitational field of a non-rotating body. Indeed, the difference of the\ndraconitic periods of two test particles moving in opposite directions along\nidentical quasi-circular orbits turns out to be non-vanishing. It depends on\nthe shape, the size and the pericenter location of the orbit, but it is\nindependent of the initial position along it. On the contrary, the\ngravitoelectric corrections to the anomalistic periods turn out to be the same\nfor both prograde and retrograde orbital motions. For a hypothetical pair of\nEarth satellites in Supertundra-like orbits, the gravitoelectric draconitic\nclock effect could be as large as 46 $\\mu$s, while a Juno-like orbital\nconfiguration around Jupiter would allow to reach about $0.01$ s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 15:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-21"}

Staring from the 3-D nonlinear elasticity (with both\ngeometrical and material nonlinearity) and by a series expansion, we deduce a\nvector plate equation with three unknowns, which exhibits the local\nforce-balance structure. The success relies on using the 3-D field equations\nand bottom traction condition to derive exact recursion relations for the\ncoefficients. Associated weak formulations are considered, leading to a 2-D\nvirtual work principle. An alternative approach based on a 2-D truncated energy\nis also provided, which is less consistent than the first plate theory but has\nthe advantage of the existence of a 2-D energy function. As an example, we\nconsider the pure bending problem of a hyperelastic block. The comparison\nbetween the analytical plate solution and available exact one shows that the\nplate theory gives second-order correct results. Comparing with existing plate\ntheories, it appears that the present one has a number of advantages, including\nthe consistency, order of correctness, generality of the loadings,\napplicability to finite-strain problems and no involvement of unphysical\nquantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 03:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

To this end, this paper proposes\nMetamaterial-enhanced Magnetic Induction (M$^2$I) communication mechanism,\nwhere a MI coil antenna is enclosed by a metamaterial shell that can enhance\nthe magnetic fields around the MI transceivers. As a result, the M$^2$I\ncommunication system can achieve tens of meters communication range by using\npocket-sized antennas.

Both a novel Virial\ntheorem analysis, and detailed classical and quantum energy calculations for\n3-space circular and elliptical orbits indicate that they have no orbital\nbinding energy in greater than 3-space. The same energy equation also excludes\nthe possibility of atom-like bodies in strictly 1 and 2-dimensions. A\nprediction is made that in the search for deviations from r^-2 of the\ngravitational force at sub-millimeter distances such a deviation must occur at\n< ~ 10^-10 m (or < ~10^-12 m considering muoniom), since atoms would\ndisintegrate if the curled up dimensions of string theory were larger than\nthis. Callender asserts that the often-repeated claim in previous work that\nstable orbits are possible in only three dimensions is not even remotely\nestablished. The binding energy analysis herein avoids the pitfalls that\nCallender points out, as it circumvents stability issues.
