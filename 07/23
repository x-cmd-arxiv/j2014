So called\nresolution-limit-free quality functions do not have this limit. This property\nwas previously introduced for hard clustering, that is, graph partitioning.\n  We investigate the resolution-limit-free property in the context of\nNon-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for hard and soft graph clustering. To\nuse NMF in the hard clustering setting, a common approach is to assign each\nnode to its highest membership cluster. We show that in this case symmetric NMF\nis not resolution-limit-free, but that it becomes so when hardness constraints\nare used as part of the optimization. The resulting function is strongly linked\nto the Constant Potts Model. In soft clustering, nodes can belong to more than\none cluster, with varying degrees of membership. In this setting\nresolution-limit-free turns out to be too strong a property. Therefore we\nintroduce locality, which roughly states that changing one part of the graph\ndoes not affect the clustering of other parts of the graph. We argue that this\nis a desirable property, provide conditions under which NMF quality functions\nare local, and propose a novel class of local probabilistic NMF quality\nfunctions for soft graph clustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 16:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

The valley-mixing and the spin-degeneracy lifting are the main\nrequirements. These are possible by wedging in the requisite ingredients in the\ndescription, viz. the atomically sharp scatterers and the strong spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC). The latter can possibly be achieved in graphene folding a\nsheet; the higher curvature of deformations correspond to stronger values of\nthe coupling. In silicene, the buckled structure of the system generates a\nstaggered sub-lattice potential between silicon atoms at A sites and B sites\nfor an applied electric field perpendicular to its plane. The stronger SOC in\nsilicene has its origin also in the buckled structure of the system. Tuning of\nelectric field, allows for rich behavior varying from a topological insulator\nto a normal insulator with a valley spin-polarized metal (VSPM) at a critical\nvalue in between. The VSPM stage is characterized by the valley-spin locking,\ni.e. the opposite spin polarization at different valleys. We shall see that in\nthis phase, if the inter-valley scattering process and the real spin-flip\nprocess in moderation are allowed to take place, we have the right condition\nfor capturing Majoranas in the proximity of a s-wave superconductor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 16:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

Some models assume that open\nmagnetic field lines are heated by Alfven waves driven by photospheric motions\nand dissipated after undergoing a turbulent cascade. Other models posit that\nmuch of the solar wind's mass and energy is injected via magnetic reconnection\nfrom closed coronal loops. The latter idea is motivated by observations of\nreconnecting jets and also by similarities of ion composition between closed\nloops and the slow wind. Wave/turbulence models have also succeeded in\nreproducing observed trends in ion composition signatures versus wind speed.\nHowever, the absolute values of the charge-state ratios predicted by those\nmodels tended to be too low in comparison with observations. This letter\nrefines these predictions by taking better account of weak Coulomb collisions\nfor coronal electrons, whose thermodynamic properties determine the ion charge\nstates in the low corona. A perturbative description of nonlocal electron\ntransport is applied to an existing set of wave/turbulence models. The\nresulting electron velocity distributions in the low corona exhibit mild\nsuprathermal tails characterized by \"kappa\" exponents between 10 and 25. These\nsuprathermal electrons are found to be sufficiently energetic to enhance the\ncharge states of oxygen ions, while maintaining the same relative trend with\nwind speed that was found when the distribution was assumed to be Maxwellian.\nThe updated wave/turbulence models are in excellent agreement with solar wind\nion composition measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 17:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In view of\nuniversality of one hidden layer network at approximating functions under weak\nconstraints, the benefit of multiple layers is to enlarge the space of\ndynamical systems approximated or, given the space, reduce the number of units\nrequired for a certain error. Traditionally shallow networks with manually\nengineered features are used, back-propagation extent is limited to one and\nattempt to choose a large number of hidden units to satisfy the Markov\ncondition is made. In case of Markov models, it has been shown that many\nsystems need to be modeled as higher order.

A new point of view\nis offered for the solution of constrained optimization problems. Some\nclassical optimization techniques on Euclidean space are generalized to\nRiemannian manifolds. Several algorithms are presented and their convergence\nproperties are analyzed employing the Riemannian structure of the manifold.\nSpecifically, two apparently new algorithms, which can be thought of as\nNewton's method and the conjugate gradient method on Riemannian manifolds, are\npresented and shown to possess, respectively, quadratic and superlinear\nconvergence. Examples of each method on certain Riemannian manifolds are given\nwith the results of numerical experiments. Rayleigh's quotient defined on the\nsphere is one example. It is shown that Newton's method applied to this\nfunction converges cubically, and that the Rayleigh quotient iteration is an\nefficient approximation of Newton's method. The Riemannian version of the\nconjugate gradient method applied to this function gives a new algorithm for\nfinding the eigenvectors corresponding to the extreme eigenvalues of a\nsymmetric matrix. Another example arises from extremizing the function\n$\\mathop{\\rm tr} {\\Theta}^{\\scriptscriptstyle\\rm T}Q{\\Theta}N$ on the special\northogonal group.

We obtained near-IR and mid-IR interferometric\nobservations of V838 Mon with the AMBER and MIDI recombiners located at the\nVery Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) array.

A significant new result is the\ndetection of a compact structure around V838 Mon, as seen from MIDI data.

With the compact array, the central star is\nunresolved ($\\Theta\\leq2.5$\\,mas), but a flattened dusty environment of $8\n\\times 11$ mas is discovered whose flux increases from about $\\sim$20% in the\n$H$ band to reach about $\\sim$50% at 2.3$\\micron$, which indicates hot\n(T$\\sim$1500\\,K) dust in the close vicinity of the star.

State-of-the-art methods show performance of 79%\nsensitivity or true-positive (TP) rate, at 10 false-positives (FP) per volume.\nWe design a two-tiered coarse-to-fine cascade framework to first operate a\nhighly sensitive candidate generation system at a maximum sensitivity of ~92%\nbut with high FP level (~50 per patient). Regions of interest (ROI) for lesion\ncandidates are generated in this step and function as input for the second\ntier. In the second tier we generate N 2D views, via scale, random\ntranslations, and rotations with respect to each ROI centroid coordinates.\nThese random views are used to train a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nclassifier. In testing, the CNN is employed to assign individual probabilities\nfor a new set of N random views that are averaged at each ROI to compute a\nfinal per-candidate classification probability. This second tier behaves as a\nhighly selective process to reject difficult false positives while preserving\nhigh sensitivities. We validate the approach on CT images of 59 patients (49\nwith sclerotic metastases and 10 normal controls). The proposed method reduces\nthe number of FP/vol. from 4 to 1.2, 7 to 3, and 12 to 9.5 when comparing a\nsensitivity rates of 60%, 70%, and 80% respectively in testing.

Based on statistical changepoint detection\nmethodology, we develop three algorithms: the Exhaustive Search (ES), the\nmixture, and the Hierarchical Mixture (H-Mix) methods. Performance of these\nmethods is evaluated by the average run length (ARL), which captures the\nfrequency of false alarms, and the detection delay. Numerical comparisons show\nthat the ES method performs the best; however, it is exponentially complex. The\nmixture method is polynomially complex by exploiting the fact that the size of\nthe community is typically small in a large network. However, it may react to a\ngroup of active edges that do not form a community. This issue is resolved by\nthe H-Mix method, which is based on a dendrogram decomposition of the network.\nWe present an asymptotic analytical expression for ARL of the mixture method\nwhen the threshold is large. Numerical simulation verifies that our\napproximation is accurate even in the non-asymptotic regime. Hence, it can be\nused to determine a desired threshold efficiently.

It has been\nfound that systems of the same symmetry, previously thought of as equivalent,\nmay in fact be distinguished by their topological properties. Moreover, the\nnon-trivial topology found in some insulators and superconductors has profound\nphysical implications that can be observed experimentally and can potentially\nbe used for applications. However, characterizing a system's topology is not\nalways a simple task, even for a theoretical model. When translation and other\nsymmetries are present in a quadratic model the topological invariants are\nreadily defined and easily calculated in a variety of symmetry classes.\nHowever, once interactions or disorder come into play the task becomes\ndifficult, and in many cases prohibitively so. The goal of this paper is to\nsuggest alternatives to the topological invariants which are based on the\nentanglement spectrum and entanglement entropy. Using quadratic models of\nsuperconductors we demonstrate that these entanglement properties are sensitive\nto changes in topology. We choose quadratic models since the topological phase\ndiagram can be mapped using the topological invariants and then compared to the\nentanglement entropy/spectrum features.

It was first observed by the EUV Variability Experiment\n(EVE) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The late phase emission\noriginates from a second set of longer loops (late phase loops) that are higher\nthan the main flaring loops. It is suggested as being caused by either\nadditional heating or long-lasting cooling. In this paper, we study the role of\nlong-lasting cooling and additional heating in producing the EUV late phase\nusing the \"enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops\" (EBTEL) model. We find\nthat a long cooling process in late phase loops can well explain the presence\nof the EUV late phase emission, but we cannot exclude the possibility of\nadditional heating in the decay phase. Moreover, we provide two preliminary\nmethods based on the UV and EUV emissions from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly\n(AIA) on board SDO to determine whether an additional heating plays some role\nor not in the late phase emission. Using nonlinear force-free field modeling,\nwe study the magnetic configuration of the EUV late phase.

We start with a full comparison of the phonon\npolarizations and energy dispersions as given by a fifth-nearest-neighbor\nforce-constant model (5NNFCM) and by elasticity theory of continuum membranes\n(ETCM). For free-edges ribbons we discuss the behavior of an additional\nacoustic edge-localized flexural mode, known as fourth acoustic branch (4ZA),\nwhich has a small gap when it is obtained by the 5NNFCM. Then, we show that\nribbons with supported-edges have a sample-size dependent energy gap in the\nphonon spectrum which is particularly large for in-plane modes. Irrespective to\nthe calculation method and the boundary condition, the dependence of the energy\ngap for the low-energy optical phonon modes against the ribbon width W is found\nto be proportional to 1/W for in-plane, and 1/W$^2$ for out-of-plane phonon\nmodes. Using the 5NNFCM, the ballistic thermal conductance and its\ncontributions from every single phonon mode are then obtained by the non\nequilibrium Green's function technique. We found that, while edge and central\nlocalized single atomic vacancies do not affect the low-energy transmission\nfunction of in-plane phonon modes, they reduce considerably the contributions\nof the flexural modes. On the other hand, in-plane modes contributions are\nstrongly dependent on the boundary conditions and at low temperatures can be\nhighly reduced in supported-edges samples. These findings could open a route to\nengineer graphene based devices where it is possible to discriminate the\nrelative contribution of polarized phonons and to tune the thermal transport on\nthe nanoscale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 21:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-24"}

The absence of off-diagonal long-range order, when lattice degrees\nof freedom are involved, challenges that excitons in these materials form a\nsuperfluid condensate of Bose particles or Cooper pairs composed of electrons\nand holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 22:21:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2014 17:48:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 14:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The idea of breaking field line connectivity by stochasticity as a\nmechanism for fast reconnection is tested with numerical simulations based on\nreduced magnetohydrodynamics equations with a strong guide field line-tied to\ntwo perfectly conducting end plates. Starting from an ideally stable force-free\nequilibrium, the system is allowed to undergo resistive relaxation. Two\ndistinct phases are found in the process of resistive relaxation. During the\nquasi-static phase, rapid change of field line connectivity and strong induced\nflow are found in regions of high field line exponentiation. However, although\nthe field line connectivity of individual field lines can change rapidly, the\noverall pattern of field line mapping appears to deform gradually. From this\nperspective, field line exponentiation appears to cause enhanced diffusion\nrather than reconnection. In some cases, resistive quasi-static evolution can\ncause the ideally stable initial equilibrium to cross a stability threshold,\nleading to formation of intense current filaments and rapid change of field\nline mapping into a qualitatively different pattern. It is in this onset phase\nthat the change of field line connectivity is more appropriately designated as\nmagnetic reconnection. Our results show that rapid change of field line\nconnectivity appears to be a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for fast\nreconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 23:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}

The successes and failures of model fluxes in\nreproducing the observed magnitudes are highlighted. Overall, extant synthetic\nfluxes predict quite realistic broad-band colours and bolometric corrections,\nespecially at optical and longer wavelengths: further improvements of the\npredictions for the blue and ultraviolet spectral regions await the use of\nhydrodynamic models where the microturbulent velocity is not treated as a free\nparameter. We show how the morphology of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD)\nchanges for different values of [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]; in particular, how\nsuitable colour combinations can easily discriminate between red giant branch\nand lower main sequence populations with different [alpha/Fe], due to the\nconcomitant loops and swings in the CMD. We also provide computer programs to\nproduce tables of synthetic bolometric corrections as well as routines to\ninterpolate in them. These colour-Teff-metallicity relations may be used to\nconvert isochrones for different chemical compositions to various bandpasses\nassuming observed reddening values, thus bypassing the standard assumption of a\nconstant colour excess for stars of different spectral type. We also show how\nsuch an assumption can lead to significant systematic errors.

Recently researchers developed the\nquasi-potential theory to represent the Waddington's landscape. The\nQuasi-potential U(x), derived from interactions in the gene regulatory network\n(GRN) of a cell, quantifies the relative stability of network states, which\ndetermine the effort required for state transitions in a multi-stable dynamical\nsystem. However, quasi-potential landscapes, originally developed for\ncontinuous systems, are not suitable for discrete-valued networks which are\nimportant tools to study complex systems. In this paper, we provide a framework\nto quantify the landscape for discrete Boolean networks (BNs). We apply our\nframework to study pancreas cell differentiation where an ensemble of BN models\nis considered based on the structure of a minimal GRN for pancreas development.\nWe impose biologically motivated structural constraints (corresponding to\nspecific type of Boolean functions) and dynamical constraints (corresponding to\nstable attractor states) to limit the space of BN models for pancreas\ndevelopment. In addition, we enforce a novel functional constraint\ncorresponding to the relative ordering of attractor states in BN models to\nrestrict the space of BN models to the biological relevant class. We find that\nBNs with canalyzing/sign-compatible Boolean functions best capture the dynamics\nof pancreas cell differentiation. This framework can also determine the genes'\ninfluence on cell state transitions, and thus can facilitate the rational\ndesign of cell reprogramming protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 07:06:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2015 13:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-09"}

As an analogy to the\nclassical proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin approach, PSD is\ndesigned to build a symplectic subspace to fit empirical data, while the\nsymplectic Galerkin projection constructs a reduced Hamiltonian system on the\nsymplectic subspace. For practical use, we introduce three algorithms for PSD,\nwhich are based upon: the cotangent lift, complex singular value decomposition,\nand nonlinear programming. The proposed technique has been proven to preserve\nsystem energy and stability. Moreover, PSD can be combined with the discrete\nempirical interpolation method to reduce the computational cost for nonlinear\nHamiltonian systems. Owing to these properties, the proposed technique is\nbetter suited than the classical POD-Galerkin approach for model reduction of\nHamiltonian systems, especially when long-time integration is required.

However, proof obligations from verifying programs with\niterative loops and multiple function calls often do not succumb to this\nparadigm. Our contribution is a proof method which -- beyond U+M -- performs\nautomatic formula re-writing by treating previously encountered obligations in\neach proof path as possible induction hypotheses. This enables us, for the\nfirst time, to systematically reason about a wide range of obligations, arising\nfrom practical program verification. We demonstrate the power of our proof\nrules on commonly used lemmas, thereby close the remaining gaps in existing\nstate-of-the-art systems. Another impact, probably more important, is that our\nmethod regains the power of compositional reasoning, and shows that the usage\nof user-provided lemmas is no longer needed for the existing set of benchmarks.\nThis not only removes the burden of coming up with the appropriate lemmas, but\nalso significantly boosts up the verification process, since lemma\napplications, coupled with unfolding, often induce very large search space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 08:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-24"}

We used new\nobservational data from the WISE satellite (Masiero et al., 2011) to construct\nthe observed SFDs.

To explain the observed SFDs in the size range D = 1 to 10 km we\nhave to also account for dynamical depletion due to the Yarkovsky effect. The\nassumption of (purely) rubble-pile asteroids leads to a significantly worse fit\nto the observed data, so that we can conclude that majority of main-belt\nasteroids are rather monolithic.

The goal\nof the infostation cache controller (CC) is to store the most popular content\nin the cache memory such that the maximum amount of traffic is offloaded to the\ninfostation. In practice, the popularity profile of the files is not known by\nthe CC, which observes only the instantaneous demands for those contents stored\nin the cache. Hence, the cache content placement is optimised based on the\ndemand history and on the cost associated to placing each content in the cache.\nBy refreshing the cache content at regular time intervals, the CC gradually\nlearns the popularity profile, while at the same time exploiting the limited\ncache capacity in the best way possible.

We show that the spin-glass transition temperature is largely\nenhanced by the spin-lattice coupling $b$ in the weakly disordered regime. This\nenhancement is ascribed to the suppression of thermal fluctuations in\nsemidiscrete degenerate manifold formed in the presence of the spin-lattice\ncoupling. We also find that, as increasing the strength of disorder, the system\nshows a concomitant transition of the nematic order and spin glass at a\ntemperature determined by $b$, being almost independent of bond disorder.\nAlthough further-neighbor exchange interactions originating in the cooperative\nlattice distortions result in the spin-lattice order in the weakly disordered\nregime, the concomitant transition remains robust.

In particular, for the large class of matter couplings considered\nin this paper, matter must possess an R-symmetry, which is gauged by the vector\nfield which becomes dynamical in the \"new minimal\" completion of the $R+\\alpha\nR^2$ theory. Thus, in the dual formulation of the theory, where the gauge\nvector is part of a massive vector multiplet, the inflaton is the superpartner\nof the massive vector of a nonlinearly realized R-symmetry. The F-term\npotential of this theory is of no-scale type, while the inflaton potential is\ngiven by the D-term of the gauged R-symmetry. The absolute minimum of the\npotential is always exactly supersymmetric, so in this class of models if\nrealistic vacua exist, they must be always metastable.

The transition from fluid to solid -at\nthe so-called jamming density- features a multitude of complex mechanisms, but\nthere is no unified theoretical framework that explains them all. In this\nstudy, a simple yet quantitative and predictive model is presented, which\nallows for a variable, changing jamming density, encompassing the memory of the\ndeformation history and explaining a multitude of phenomena at and around\njamming. The jamming density, now introduced as a new state-variable, changes\ndue to the deformation history and relates the system's macroscopic response to\nits microstructure. The packing efficiency can increase logarithmically slow\nunder gentle repeated (isotropic) compression, leading to an increase of the\njamming density. In contrast, shear deformations cause anisotropy, changing the\npacking efficiency exponentially fast with either dilatancy or compactancy. The\nmemory of the system near jamming can be explained by a microstatistical model\nthat involves a multiscale, fractal energy landscape and links the microscopic\nparticle picture to the macroscopic continuum description, providing a unified\nexplanation for the qualitatively different flow-behavior for different\ndeformation modes. To complement our work, a recipe to extract the\nhistory-dependent jamming density from experimentally accessible data is\nproposed, and alternative state-variables are compared.

Field studies suggest that, for large\nfailures, the frequencies of these two quantities decrease as power laws of the\nrespective magnitudes, defining two different decay exponents. Moreover, the\nhorizontal area increases as a power law of the maximum local retreat,\nidentifying a third exponent. Such observation suggests that the geometry of\ncliff failures are statistically similar for different magnitudes. Power laws\nare familiar in the physics of critical systems. The corresponding exponents\nsatisfy precise relations and are proven to be universal features, common to\nvery different systems. Following the approach typical of statistical physics,\nwe propose a \"scaling hypothesis\" resulting in a relation between the three\nabove exponents: there is a precise, mathematical relation between the\ndistributions of magnitudes of erosion events and their geometry. Beyond its\ntheoretical value, such relation could be useful for the validation of field\ncatalogs analysis. Pushing the statistical physics approach further, we develop\na numerical model of marine erosion that reproduces the observed failure\nstatistics. Despite the minimality of the model, the exponents resulting from\nextensive numerical simulations fairly agree with those measured on the field.\nThese results suggest that the mathematical theory of percolation, which lies\nbehind our simple model, can possibly be used as a guide to decipher the\nphysics of rocky coast erosion and could provide precise predictions to the\nstatistics of cliff collapses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 11:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-24"}

We report on\nthe compilation of a consistent sample of fully convective stars within two of\nthe most well-studied and youngest, nearby regions of star formation: the Orion\nNebula Cluster (ONC) and Taurus-Auriga. We calculate the average specific\nstellar AM ($j_{\\star}$) assuming solid body rotation, using surface rotation\nperiods gathered from the literature and new estimates of stellar radii and\nages. We use published Spitzer IRAC fluxes to classify our stars as Class II or\nClass III and compare their $j_{\\star}$ evolution. Our results suggest that\ndisc dispersal is a rapid process that occurs at a variety of ages. We find a\nconsistent $j_{\\star}$ reduction rate between the Class II and Class III PMS\nstars which we interpret as indicating a period of accretion disc-regulated AM\nevolution followed by near-constant AM evolution once the disc has dissipated.\nFurthermore, assuming our observed spread in stellar ages is real, we find the\nremoval rate of $j_{\\star}$ during the Class II phase is more rapid than\nexpected by contraction at constant stellar rotation rate. A much more\nefficient process of AM removal must exist, most likely in the form of an\naccretion-driven stellar wind or other outflow from the star-disc interaction\nregion or extended disc surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 13:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Channel-resolved above-threshold\nionization measurements reveal that strong-field ionization opens four\nchannels. Two of them, identified by monitoring the ellipticity dependence of\nthe high-harmonic emission, are found to dominate the harmonic signal. A switch\nfrom the HOMO-3 to the HOMO-1 channel at 26 eV is confirmed by a phase jump in\nthe harmonic emission, and by the differing dynamical responses to molecular\nvibrations.

It is found that we can conclude\nthat surface electrostatic charge distributions indeed contribute to the\nstructural stability of wild-type RaPrPC; this may be useful for the medicinal\ntreatment of prion diseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 14:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-25"}

Aims: We wish to\nexploit the unmatched combination of high angular resolution, high sensitivity,\nhigh-imaging fidelity, and spectral coverage provided by ALMA to shed light on\nthe complex kinematics of the innermost central regions of HH212. Methods: We\nmapped the inner 10\" (4500 AU) of the HH212 system at about 0.5 arcsec\nresolution in several molecular tracers and in the 850 $\\mu$m dust continuum\nusing the ALMA interferometer in band 7 in the extended configuration of the\nEarly Science Cycle 0 operations. Results: Within a single ALMA spectral\nset-up, we simultaneously identify all the crucial ingredients known to be\ninvolved in the star formation recipe namely: (i) the fast, collimated bipolar\nSiO jet driven by the protostar, (ii) the large-scale swept-up CO outflow,\n(iii) the flattened rotating and infalling envelope, with bipolar cavities\ncarved by the outflow (in C$^{17}$O(3--2)), and (iv) a rotating wide-angle flow\nthat fills the cavities and surrounding the axial jet (in C$^{34}$S(7--6)).

In this paper, we address each of these issues, resulting in a\ncomputationally and memory-bounded solution. First, we introduce a dynamic\nversion of the successive shortest-path algorithm which solves the data\nassociation problem optimally while reusing computation, resulting in\nsignificantly faster inference than standard solvers. Second, we address the\noptimal solution to the data association problem when dealing with an incoming\nstream of data (i.e., online setting). Finally, we present our main\ncontribution which is an approximate online solution with bounded memory and\ncomputation which is capable of handling videos of arbitrarily length while\nperforming tracking in real time.

An unusually broad\nin-plane dielectric relaxation is detected below about 60 K; it slows down much\nfaster than the dc conductivity following an Arrhenius law. At around 17 K we\ncan identify a pronounced dielectric anomaly concomitantly with anomalous\nfeatures in the mean relaxation time and spectral broadening.

The first gamma-ray pulsars to be detected were the most\nintense and/or those with narrow pulses. Aims: As the Fermi mission progresses,\nprogressively fainter objects can be studied. In addition to more distant\npulsars (thus probing a larger volume of the Galaxy), or ones in high\nbackground regions (thus improving the sampling uniformity across the Galactic\nplane), we detect pulsars with broader pulses or lower luminosity. Adding\npulsars to our catalog with inclination angles that are rare in the observed\nsample, and/or with lower spindown power, will reduce the bias in the currently\nknown gamma-ray pulsar population. Methods: We use rotation ephemerides derived\nfrom radio observations to phase-fold gamma rays recorded by the Fermi Large\nArea Telescope, to then determine the pulse profile properties. Spectral\nanalysis provides the luminosities and, when the signal-to-noise ratio allows,\nthe cutoff energies. We constrain the pulsar distances by different means in\norder to minimize the luminosity uncertainties. Results: We present six new\ngamma-ray pulsars with an eclectic mix of properties. Three are young, and\nthree are recycled.

During its eleven day science flight in\nthe Austral Summer of 2012, it operated 955 spider-web transition edge sensor\n(TES) bolometers separated into bands at 150, 250 and 410 GHz. This is the\nfirst time that an array of TES bolometers has been used on a balloon platform\nto conduct science observations. Polarization sensitivity was provided by a\nwire grid and continuously rotating half-wave plate. The balloon implementation\nof the bolometer array and readout electronics presented unique development\nrequirements. Here we present an outline of the readout system, the remote\ntuning of the bolometers and Superconducting QUantum Interference Device\n(SQUID) amplifiers, and preliminary current noise of the bolometer array and\nreadout system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 18:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In order to decrease the time\ncomplexity of the original SynC algorithm, we combine grid cell partitioning\nmethod and Red-Black tree to construct the near neighbor point set of every\npoint. By simulated experiments of some artificial data sets and several real\ndata sets, we observe that FSynC algorithm can often get less time than SynC\nalgorithm for many kinds of data sets. At last, it gives some research\nexpectations to popularize this algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 09:14:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}

The general form of the non-Galilean transformation is\ndeduced in the paper. For the non-Galilean transformation time is different in\nthe rotating and resting frame. This transformation contains a constant, with\nthe dimension of time. The constant is assumed to be fundamental. The\ntransformation forms the necessary condition for the existence of periodic,\nbounded and square integrable solutions in both the rotating and resting frame.\nVariety of such solutions exists. Among the solutions massless states are\nidentified. They describe localized neutrinos with invariable spin. The states\nin the resting frame are not stationary but they have a good chance to be\nstable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Jul 2014 19:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-01"}
