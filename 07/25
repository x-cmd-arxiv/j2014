In this article we aim to address this question by explicitly\nconnecting the optimal wealth allocation to the minimal martingale measure. We\nachieve this by using a \"trick\" of observing this problem in the context of\nmodel uncertainty via a two person zero sum stochastic differential game\nbetween the investor and an antagonistic market that provides a probability\nmeasure. We obtain some startling insights. Firstly, if short-selling is not\npermitted and if the factor process evolves under the minimal martingale\nmeasure then the investor's optimal strategy can only be to invest in the\nriskless asset (i.e. the no-regret strategy). Secondly, if the factor process\nand the stock price process have independent noise, then even if the market\nallows short selling, the optimal strategy for the investor must be the\nno-regret strategy while the factor process will evolve under the minimal\nmartingale measure .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 16:58:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 21:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

We describe the\ntransmission of the occulter as a sum of basis functions. For each element of\nthe basis, we numerically computed the Fresnel diffraction at the aperture of\nthe telescope and the complex amplitude at its focus. The basis functions are\ncircular disks that are linearly apodized over a few centimeters (truncated\ncones). We complemented the numerical calculation of the Fresnel diffraction\nfor these functions by a comparison with pure circular discs (cylinder) for\nwhich an analytical expression, based on a decomposition in Lommel series, is\navailable. The technique of deriving the optimal transmission for a given\nspectral bandwidth is a classical regularized quadratic minimization of\nintensities, but linear optimizations can be used as well. Minimizing the\nintegrated intensity on the aperture of the telescope or for selected regions\nof the focal plane leads to slightly different transmissions for the occulter.\nFor the focal plane optimization, the resulting residual intensity is\nconcentrated behind the geometrical image of the occulter, in a blind region\nfor the observation of an exoplanet, and the level of background residual\nstarlight becomes very low outside this image. Finally, we provide a tolerance\nanalysis for the alignment of the occulter to the telescope which also favors\nthe focal plane optimization.This means that telescope offsets of a few\ndecimeters do not strongly reduce the efficiency of the occulter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 17:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-24"}

In this Letter, we provide a thorough assessment of\ntheir nature for the general case of normal and oblique plane wave incidence,\nhighlighting when a Fano resonance is affected by the mutual coupling in an\narray and its capability to support free modal solutions. We analyze the\nrepresentative case of a metasurface of plasmonic nanoshells at ultraviolet\nfrequencies and compute its absorption under TE- and TM-polarized, oblique\nplane-wave incidence. In particular, we find that plasmonic metasurfaces\ndisplay two distinct types of resonances observable as absorption peaks: one is\nrelated to the Mie, dipolar resonance of each nanoparticle; the other is due to\nthe forced excitation of free modes with small attenuation constant, usually\nfound at oblique incidence. The latter is thus an array-induced collective Fano\nresonance. This realization opens up to manifold flexible designs at optical\nfrequencies mixing individual and collective resonances. We explain the\nphysical origin of such Fano resonances using the modal analysis, which allows\nto calculate the free modes with complex wavenumber supported by the\nmetasurface. We define equivalent array dipolar polarizabilities that are\ndirectly related to the absorption physics at oblique incidence and show a\ndirect dependence between array modal phase and attenuation constant and Fano\nresonances. We thus provide a more complete picture of Fano resonances that may\nlead to the design of filters, energy-harvesting devices, photodetectors, and\nsensors at ultraviolet frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 17:28:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 17:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

FLRW manifold is covered by global coordinates (t,y^i),\nwhere t is the cosmic time coinciding with the proper time of the Hubble\nobservers. We introduce local inertial coordinates x^a=(x^0,x^i) in the\nvicinity of a world line of a Hubble observer with the help of a special\nconformal transformation. The local inertial metric is Minkowski flat and is\nmaterialized by the congruence of time-like geodesics of static observers being\nat rest with respect to the local spatial coordinates x^i. We consider geodesic\nmotion of test particles and notice that the local coordinate time x^0=x^0(t)\ntaken as a parameter along the world line of particle, is a function of the\nHubble's observer time t. This function changes smoothly from x^0=t for a\nparticle at rest (observer's clock), to x^0=t+1/2 Ht^2 for photons, where H is\nthe Hubble constant. Thus, motion of a test particle is non-uniform when its\nworld line is parametrized by time t. NASA JPL Orbit Determination Program\npresumes that motion of light (after the Shapiro delay is excluded) is uniform\nwith respect to the time t but it does not comply with the non-uniform motion\nof light on cosmological manifold. For this reason, the motion of light in the\nsolar system analysed with the Orbit Determination Program appears as having a\nsystematic blue shift of frequency, of radio waves circulating in the\nEarth-spacecraft radio link. The magnitude of the anomalous blue shift of\nfrequency is proportional to the Hubble constant H that may open an access to\nthe measurement of this fundamental cosmological parameter in the solar system\nradiowave experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 17:48:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 01:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-23"}

The laser metrology system of GRAVITY is at the heart of its\nastrometric mode, which must measure the distance of 2 stars with a precision\nof 10 micro-arcseconds. This means the metrology has to measure the optical\npath difference between the two beam combiners of GRAVITY to a level of 5 nm.\nThe metrology design presents some non-common paths that have consequently to\nbe stable at a level of 1 nm. Otherwise they would impact the performance of\nGRAVITY. The various tests we made in the past on the prototype give us hints\non the components responsible for this error, and on their respective\ncontribution to the total error. It is however difficult to assess their exact\norigin from only OPD measurements, and therefore, to propose a solution to this\nproblem. In this paper, we present the results of a semi-empirical modeling of\nthe fibered metrology system, relying on theoretical basis, as well as on\ncharacterisations of key components. The modeling of the metrology system\nregarding various effects, e.g., temperature, waveguide heating or mechanical\nstress, will help us to understand how the metrology behave. The goals of this\nmodeling are to 1) model the test set-ups and reproduce the measurements (as a\nvalidation of the modeling), 2) determine the origin of the non-common path\nerrors, and 3) propose modifications to the current metrology design to reach\nthe required 1nm stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 18:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-07"}

The strength of the alignment is dependent on the properties of both the\nsatellites and centrals. Theoretical studies using dissipationless N-body\nsimulations are limited by their inability to directly predict the shape of\nCGs. Using hydrodynamical simulations including gas cooling, star formation,\nand feedback, we carry out a study of galaxy alignment and its dependence on\nthe galaxy properties predicted directly from the simulations.We found that the\nobserved alignment signal is well produced, as is the color dependence: red\nsatellites and red centrals both show stronger alignments than their blue\ncounterparts. The reason for the stronger alignment of red satellites is that\nmost of them stay in the inner region of the dark matter halo where the shape\nof the CG better traces the dark matter distribution. The dependence of\nalignment on the color of CGs arises from the halo mass dependence, since the\nalignment between the shape of the central stellar component and the inner halo\nincreases with halo mass. We also find that the alignment of satellites is most\nstrongly dependent on their metallicity, suggesting that the metallicity of\nsatellites, rather than color, is a better tracer of galaxy alignment on small\nscales. This could be tested in future observational studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 20:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2014 20:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-08"}

They thus play a crucial role in the study\nof the formation of bipolar Planetary Nebulae (PNe). To date, 14 water fountain\nnebulae have been identified. The identification of more sources in this unique\nstage of stellar evolution will enable us to study the origin of bipolar PNe\nmorphologies in more detail. We present the results of seven sources observed\nwith the JVLA that were identified as water fountain candidates in an\nEffelsberg 100m telescope survey of 74 AGB and early post-AGB stars. We find\nthat our sample of water fountain candidates displays strong variability in\ntheir 22 GHz H2O maser spectra. The JVLA observations show an extended bipolar\nH2O maser outflow for one source, the OH/IR star IRAS 18455+0448. This source\nwas previously classified as a 'dying' OH/IR star based on the exponential\ndecrease of its 1612 MHz OH maser and the lack of H2O masers. We therefore also\nre-observed the 1612, 1665, and 1667 MHz OH masers. We confirm that the 1612\nMHz masers have not reappeared and find that the 1665/1667 MHz masers have\ndecreased in strength by several orders of magnitude during the last decade.\nThe OH/IR star IRAS 18455+0448 is confirmed to be a new addition to the class\nof water fountain nebulae. Its kinematic age is approximately 70 yr, but could\nbe lower, depending on the distance and inclination. Previous observations\nindicate, with significant uncertainty, that IRAS 18455+0448 has a surprisingly\nlow mass compared to available estimates for other water fountain nebulae.

The skewon contribution to\nthe Minkowski vacuum is a subject that does not arise in the ordinary models of\nLorentz violation based on a modified Lagrangian. We derive the covector\nparametrization of the skewon optic tensor and discuss its $U(1)$-gauge\nsymmetry.

Except\nfor direct plasma simulations, all modeling efforts must rely on a given form\nof the diffusion coefficient, a key parameter that embodies the interactions of\nenergetic charged particles with the magnetic turbulence. The so-called Bohm\nlimit is commonly employed. In this paper we revisit the question of\nacceleration at perpendicular shocks, by employing a realistic model of\nperpendicular diffusion. Our coefficient reduces to a power-law in momentum for\nlow momenta (of index $\\alpha$), but becomes independent of the particle\nmomentum at high momenta (reaching a constant value $\\kappa_{\\infty}$ above\nsome characteristic momentum $p_{\\rm c}$). We first provide simple analytical\nexpressions of the maximum momentum that can be reached at a given time with\nthis coefficient. Then we perform time-dependent numerical simulations to\ninvestigate the shape of the particle distribution that can be obtained when\nthe particle pressure back-reacts on the flow.

Of particular interest, low values of $p_{\\rm c}$ tend to remove the\nconcavity once thought to be typical of non-linear DSA, and result in steep\nspectra, as required by recent high-energy observations of Galactic SNRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 20:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In combination with Time\nDivision Duplex and with simple per-cell processing, it achieves large\nthroughput per cell, low latency, and attractive power efficiency performance.\nFollowing the current wireless technology trend of moving to higher frequency\nbands and denser small cell deployments, a large number of antennas can be\nimplemented within a small form factor even in small cell base stations. In a\nheterogeneous network formed by large (macro) and small cell BSs, a key system\noptimization problem consists of \"load balancing\", that is, associating users\nto BSs in order to avoid congested hot-spots and/or under-utilized\ninfrastructure.

By modeling the\noperations and their interactions as a graph, one can identify the independent\noperations by solving a graph coloring problem. Many efficient sequential\nalgorithms are known for this NP-Complete problem, but they are typically\nunsuitable when the operations and their interactions are distributed in the\nmemory of large parallel computers. On top of an existing distributed-memory\ngraph coloring algorithm, we investigate two compatible techniques in this\npaper for fast and scalable distributed-memory graph coloring. First, we\nintroduce an improvement for the distributed post-processing operation, called\nrecoloring, which drastically improves the number of colors. We propose a novel\nand efficient communication scheme for recoloring which enables it to scale\ngracefully. Recoloring must be seeded with an existing coloring of the graph.\nOur second contribution is to introduce a randomized color selection strategy\nfor initial coloring which quickly produces solutions of modest quality. We\nextensively evaluate the impact of our new techniques on existing distributed\nalgorithms and show the time-quality tradeoffs. We show that combining an\ninitial randomized coloring with multiple recoloring iterations yields better\nquality solutions with the smaller runtime at large scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 22:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-28"}

Generally, transfer characteristics of field-effect\ntransistors show no dependence on the length of the source/drain contacts\nbecause charge carrier injection occurs mainly at the edges of the contact.\nHowever, the shape of the transfer characteristics of devices fabricated using\nNi contacts is found to be dependent on the length of the contact. This\npeculiar behavior was attributed to charge carrier injection from near the\ncenter of the contacts. This is because of oxygen diffusion and the resultant\nformation of an interfacial oxide layer of non-uniform thickness. The observed\ncontact length dependent transfer characteristics were reproduced using a model\ncalculation that includes charge carrier injection from the center of the\nelectrode and subsequent charge transport underneath the metal contact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 22:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-28"}

Both the center and radius functions of these confidence spheres are\nflexible functions of the data.

Since both the coverage probability and the scaled expected volume are\nfunctions of the Euclidean norm of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, it is feasible to\noptimize the performance of the recentered confidence sphere by numerically\ncomputing both the center and radius functions so as to optimize some clearly\nspecified criterion.

These three indicators generally agree in\nvelocity and direction, and are consistent with a simple picture in which the\ngas is stationary or slowly outflowing at a few hundred km/s from the embedded\ngalaxies. The absence of stronger outflows is not a projection effect: the\ncovering fraction for our sample is limited to <1/8 (13%). The outflow\nvelocities exclude models in which star formation or AGN produce \"super\" or\n\"hyper\" winds of up to ~1000km/s. The Dv_Lya offsets here are smaller than\ntypical of LBGs, but similar to those of compact LAEs. The latter suggests that\noutflow speed cannot be a dominant factor in driving extended Lya emission. For\none Lya blob (CDFS-LAB14), whose Lya profile and metal absorption line offsets\nsuggest no significant bulk motion, we use a simple radiative transfer model to\nmake the first column density measurement of gas in an embedded galaxy, finding\nit consistent with a DLA system.

Given\npairwise dissimilarities between the elements of a `source set' and a `target\nset,' we consider the problem of finding a subset of the source set, called\nrepresentatives or exemplars, that can efficiently describe the target set. We\nformulate the problem as a row-sparsity regularized trace minimization problem.\nSince the proposed formulation is, in general, NP-hard, we consider a convex\nrelaxation. The solution of our optimization finds representatives and the\nassignment of each element of the target set to each representative, hence,\nobtaining a clustering. We analyze the solution of our proposed optimization as\na function of the regularization parameter. We show that when the two sets\njointly partition into multiple groups, our algorithm finds representatives\nfrom all groups and reveals clustering of the sets. In addition, we show that\nthe proposed framework can effectively deal with outliers. Our algorithm works\nwith arbitrary dissimilarities, which can be asymmetric or violate the triangle\ninequality. To efficiently implement our algorithm, we consider an Alternating\nDirection Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework, which results in quadratic\ncomplexity in the problem size. We show that the ADMM implementation allows to\nparallelize the algorithm, hence further reducing the computational time.\nFinally, by experiments on real-world datasets, we show that our proposed\nalgorithm improves the state of the art on the two problems of scene\ncategorization using representative images and time-series modeling and\nsegmentation using representative~models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 08:30:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2016 03:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

A\nvolumetric velocimetry system based on Defocused Digital Particle Image\nVelocimetry is used to show that above a critical visual concentration of\nparticles in the images, the concentration and accuracy of the final\ninstantaneous raw velocity vector field drop. The critical concentration\ndepends on physical parameters as well as on the processing algorithms. Three\ndistinct regimes are identified.

Finally, we review a mean-field approach derived from first\nprinciples, which provides a theoretical framework for the density instability\ncausing the phase separation in active colloids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 09:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-03"}

The vibrational modes that are internal to WO4 tetrahedra\noccur at the highest energies consistent with the relative stability of WO4\ntetrahedra. The neutron data and the ab-initio calculations are found to be in\nexcellent agreement. The neutron and structural data are used to develop and\nvalidate an interatomic potential model. The model is used for classical\nmolecular dynamics simulations to study their response to high pressure. We\nhave calculated the enthalpies of the scheelite and fergusonite phases as a\nfunction of pressure, which confirms that the scheelite to fergusonite\ntransition is second order in nature. With increase in pressure, there is a\ngradual change in the AO8 polyhedra, while there is no apparent change in the\nWO4 tetrahedra. We found that that all the four tungstates amorphize at high\npressure. This is in good agreement with available experimental observations\nwhich show amorphization at around 45 GPa in BaWO4 and 40 GPa in CaWO4. On\namorphization, there is an abrupt increase in the coordination of the W atom\nwhile the bisdisphenoids around A atom are considerably distorted. The pair\ncorrelation functions of the various atom pairs corroborate these observations.\nOur observations aid in predicting the pressure of amorphization in SrWO4 and\nPbWO4, which have not been experimentally reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 10:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

A\ncrucial question is to understand what is the mutual interaction between birds\ngenerating such nontrivial correlations. Here we use the Maximum Entropy (ME)\napproach to infer from experimental data of natural flocks the effective\ninteractions between birds.

The NIbc/NII ratio is higher in a broad\nbin of early-type hosts. The NIa/NCC ratio is nearly constant when changing\nfrom normal, perturbed to interacting galaxies, then declines in merging\ngalaxies, whereas it jumps to the highest value in post-merging/remnant\ngalaxies. In contrast, the NIbc/NII ratio jumps to the highest value in merging\ngalaxies and slightly declines in post-merging/remnant subsample. The\ninterpretation is that the star formation rates and morphologies of galaxies,\nwhich are strongly affected in the final stages of interaction, have an impact\non the number ratios of SNe types. The NIa/NCC (NIbc/NII) ratio increases\n(decreases) from star-forming to active galactic nuclei (AGN) classes of\ngalaxies.

Thus, when the effect of heat fluxes is\nnot profound acoustic waves will grow due to the velocity shear, while at\nsupercritical heat fluxes the flow reveals compressible thermal instability.\nAnisotropic thermal instability should be also important in astrophysical\nenvironments, where it will limit the maximal value of magnetic field that a\nlow density ionized anisotropic flow can sustain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 15:34:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 06:28:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2015 18:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

X-rays, given\ntheir penetrating power, provide the most secure way for finding these AGN. The\nXMM-Newton serendipitous source catalog is the largest catalog of X-ray sources\never produced; it contains about half a million detections. These sources are\nmostly AGN. We have derived X-ray spectral fits for very many 3XMM-DR4 sources\n($\\gtrsim$ 114 000 observations, corresponding to $\\sim$ 77 000 unique\nsources), which contain more than 50 source photons per detector. Here, we use\na subsample of $\\simeq$ 1000 AGN in the footprint of the SDSS area (covering\n120 deg$^2$) with available spectroscopic redshifts. We searched for highly\nobscured AGN by applying an automated selection technique based on X-ray\nspectral analysis that is capable of efficiently selecting AGN. The selection\nis based on the presence of either a) flat rest-frame spectra; b) flat observed\nspectra; c) an absorption turnover, indicative of a high rest-frame column\ndensity; or d) an Fe K$\\alpha$ line with an equivalent width > 500 eV. We found\n81 highly obscured candidate sources. Subsequent detailed manual spectral fits\nrevealed that 28 of them are heavily absorbed by column densities higher than\n10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. Of these 28 AGN, 15 are candidate Compton-thick AGN on the\nbasis of either a high column density, consistent within the 90% confidence\nlevel with N$_{\\rm H}$ $>$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, or a large equivalent width\n(>500 eV) of the Fe K$\\alpha$ line. Another six are associated with\nnear-Compton-thick AGN with column densities of $\\sim$ 5$\\times$10$^{23}$\ncm$^{-2}$.
