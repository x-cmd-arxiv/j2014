Intelligence agencies exploit\ninformation obtained from the analysis of large amounts of heterogeneous data\nderiving from various informative sources including the records of phone\ntraffic, the social networks, surveillance data, interview data, experiential\npolice data, and police intelligence files, to acquire knowledge about criminal\nnetworks and initiate accurate and destabilizing actions. In this context,\nvisual representation techniques coordinate the exploration of the structure of\nthe network together with the metrics of social network analysis. Nevertheless,\nthe utility of visualization tools may become limited when the dimension and\nthe complexity of the system under analysis grow beyond certain terms. In this\npaper we show how we employ some interactive visualization techniques to\nrepresent criminal and terrorist networks reconstructed from phone traffic\ndata, namely foci, fisheye and geo-mapping network layouts. These methods allow\nthe exploration of the network through animated transitions among visualization\nmodels and local enlargement techniques in order to improve the comprehension\nof interesting areas. By combining the features of the various visualization\nmodels it is possible to gain substantial enhancements with respect to classic\nvisualization models, often unreadable in those cases of great complexity of\nthe network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 16:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-11"}

However, in the latest years,\nthe widespread adoption of XML in the most disparate application fields pushed\na growing number of researchers to design XML-specific Schema Matching\napproaches, called XML Matchers, aiming at finding semantic matchings between\nconcepts defined in DTDs and XSDs. XML Matchers do not just take well-known\ntechniques originally designed for other data models and apply them on\nDTDs/XSDs, but they exploit specific XML features (e.g., the hierarchical\nstructure of a DTD/XSD) to improve the performance of the Schema Matching\nprocess. The design of XML Matchers is currently a well-established research\narea. The main goal of this paper is to provide a detailed description and\nclassification of XML Matchers. We first describe to what extent the\nspecificities of DTDs/XSDs impact on the Schema Matching task.

However, this theory does not describe how the auctioneer comes to\npossess this information. Recently, Cole and Roughgarden [2014] showed that an\napproximation based on a finite sample of independent draws from each bidder's\ndistribution is sufficient to produce a near-optimal auction. In this work, we\nconsider the problem of learning bidders' valuation distributions from much\nweaker forms of observations. Specifically, we consider a setting where there\nis a repeated, sealed-bid auction with $n$ bidders, but all we observe for each\nround is who won, but not how much they bid or paid. We can also participate\n(i.e., submit a bid) ourselves, and observe when we win. From this information,\nour goal is to (approximately) recover the inherently recoverable part of the\nunderlying bid distributions. We also consider extensions where different\nsubsets of bidders participate in each round, and where bidders' valuations\nhave a common-value component added to their independent private values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 16:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-11"}

Our results include\n  - a classification of embedded harmonic ends of small total curvature,\n  - the construction of examples of embedded ends of arbitrarily large total\ncurvature,\n  - a classification of complete embedded harmonic surfaces of small total\ncurvature in the spirit of the corresponding classification of minimal surfaces\nof small total curvature, and\n  - the largely experimental construction of complete embedded harmonic\nsurfaces with non-trivial topology that incorporate some of the new harmonic\nends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 17:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-11"}

Recent progress has taken advantage of random\ngeometric graph theory to show how asymptotic optimality can also be achieved\nwith these methods. Achieving this desirable property for systems with dynamics\nrequires solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) in the state space of\nthe underlying dynamical system. It is difficult, however, if not impractical,\nto generate a BVP solver for a variety of important dynamical models of robots\nor physically simulated ones.

The\nradio emission is typically well characterized by the free-free emission\nprocess. Most models to date have assumed spherical symmetry for the eruption,\nalthough it has been known for as long as there have been radio observations of\nthese systems, that spherical eruptions are to simplistic a geometry. In this\npaper, we build bipolar models of the nova eruption, assuming the free-free\nprocess, and show the effects of varying different parameters on the radio\nlight curves. The parameters considered include the ratio of the minor- to\nmajor-axis, the inclination angle and shell thickness (further parameters are\nprovided in the appendix). We also show the uncertainty introduced when fitting\nspherical model synthetic light curves to bipolar model synthetic light curves.\nWe find that the optically thick phase rises with the same power law ($S_{\\nu}\n\\propto t^2$) for both the spherical and bipolar models. In the bipolar case\nthere is a \"plateau\" phase -- depending on the thickness of the shell as well\nas the ratio of the minor- to major-axis -- before the final decline, that\nfollows the same power law ($S_{\\nu} \\propto t^{-3}$) as in the spherical case.\nFinally, fitting spherical models to the bipolar model synthetic light curves\nrequires, in the worst case scenario, doubling the ejected mass, more than\nhalving the electron temperature and reducing the shell thickness by nearly a\nfactor of 10. This implies that in some systems we have been over predicting\nthe ejected masses and under predicting the electron temperature of the ejecta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-18"}

We discuss how both results can be reconciled. Our\nfindings indicate that the cluster was either primordially mass-segregated\nand/or used to be significantly more compact in the past. For the latter case,\nwe propose tidal shocks as the mechanism driving the cluster's expansion, which\nwould imply that Palomar 14 is on a highly eccentric orbit. Conversely, if the\ncluster formed already extended and with primordial mass segregation, this\ncould support an accretion origin of the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 20:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}

This survey presents counting\nresults for some special classes of multivariate polynomials over a finite\nfield, namely the the reducible ones, the s-powerful ones (divisible by the\ns-th power of a nonconstant polynomial), the relatively irreducible ones\n(irreducible but reducible over an extension field), the decomposable ones, and\nalso for reducible space curves.

It is intuitively clear that the decomposable\npolynomials form a small minority among all polynomials. The tame case, where\nthe characteristic p of Fq does not divide n = deg f, is fairly\nwell-understood, and we obtain closely matching upper and lower bounds on the\nnumber of decomposable polynomials. In the wild case, where p does divide n,\nthe bounds are less satisfactory, in particular when p is the smallest prime\ndivisor of n and divides n exactly twice.

We study the connected sigma models in\nthe large-N limit finding supersymmetric vacua and determining the particle\nspectrum. While the Witten index vanishes in all the models under\nconsideration, in these special cases of connected models one can use a\npermutation symmetry to define a modification of the Witten index which does\nnot vanish. This eliminates the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry. We then\nexamine the exact beta functions of our connected (0,2) sigma models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 22:08:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 22:34:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

Although asteroseismology has been\nshown to be able to deliver the most precise constraints so far, the number of\ndetailed seismic studies delivering quantitative results is limited. Our goal\nis to extend this limited sample with an in-depth case study and provide a\nwell-constrained set of asteroseismic parameters, contributing to the ongoing\nmapping efforts of the instability strips of the beta Cep and SPB stars. We\nderived fundamental parameters from high-resolution spectra using spectral\nsynthesis techniques.

In such cases, the unneeded external power is\nwasted, and the signal is additionally degraded by noise and distortions that\naccompany active gain processes. We show noiseless, intensity amplification of\nrepetitive optical pulse waveforms with a gain from 2 to ~20 without using\nactive gain, by recycling energy already stored in the input repetitive signal.\nThis \"green\" method uses dispersion-induced self-imaging (Talbot) effects to\nprecisely re-distribute the original signal energy into fewer replica\nwaveforms.

This is consistent with previous results deduced from semi-empirical\nmodels and confirms that a local heating occurs in the lower atmosphere during\nthe appearance of EBs. We also find that the optical depths can increase to\nsome extent in both the lower and upper clouds, which may result from either a\ndirect heating in the lower cloud, or illumination by an enhanced radiation on\nthe upper cloud. The velocities derived from this method, however, are\ndifferent from those obtained using the traditional bisector method, implying\nthat one should be cautious when interpreting this parameter. The two-cloud\nmodel can thus be used as an efficient method to deduce the basic physical\nparameters of EBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 07:24:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-12"}

A novel ingredient is that such a Fermi surface encloses a Weyl\npoint with definite chirality, referred to as a chiral Fermi surface, which can\narise from breaking of either time reversal or inversion symmetry in systems\nwith strong spin-orbit coupling, responsible for both Berry curvature and\nchiral anomaly. As a result, electromagnetic properties of the Weyl metallic\nstate are described not by conventional Maxwell equations but by axion\nelectrodynamics, where Maxwell equations are modified with a\ntopological-in-origin spatially modulated $\\theta(\\bm{r}) \\bm{E} \\cdot \\bm{B}$\nterm.

It is\nshown that fluxes at 8 and 24 micron characterizing the emission of polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and hot dust grains decrease with age, but their\nratio increases. This implies that the relative PAH contribution to the total\ninfrared flux increases with age. It is suggested that the detected increase in\nthe ratio of the fluxes at 8 and 24 micron is related to the growth in the PAH\nmass due to destruction of larger grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 08:42:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-14"}

When mutations\nare rare, the community evolves on the mutational scale according to a\nMarkovian jump process.

We then assume that mutations have a small impact on\nphenotypes and consider the evolution of monomorphic prey and predator\npopulations. The limit of small mutation steps leads to a system of two\ndifferential equations which is a version of the canonical equation of adaptive\ndynamics for the prey-predator coevolution.

We also detect an intervening Ca II absorption doublet in the\nspectrum of MH 2136-428 that is ascribed to the the halo of a nearby giant\nelliptical galaxy at \\sim 100 kpc of projected distance. Conclusions. Under the\nhypothesis that all BL Lacs are hosted by luminous bulge dominated galaxies,\nthe present state of art spectroscopic observations of bright BL Lacs indicate\nthat these objects are likely sources with extremely beamed nuclear emission .\nWe present simulations to show under which circustances it will be possible to\nprobe this hypothesis from the detection of very weak absorptions using the\nnext generation of extremely large optical telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 09:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}

The primary focus of regression\ntesting should be on code associated with: a) earlier bug fixes; and b)\nparticular application scenarios considered to be important by the tester.\nExisting coverage criteria do not enable such focus, e.g., 100% branch coverage\ndoes not guarantee that a given bug fix is exercised or a given application\nscenario is tested. Therefore, there is a need for a complementary coverage\ncriterion in which the user can define a test requirement characterizing a\ngiven behavior to be covered as opposed to choosing from a pool of pre-defined\nand generic program elements. We propose UCov, a user-defined coverage\ncriterion wherein a test requirement is an execution pattern of program\nelements and predicates. Our proposed criterion is not meant to replace\nexisting criteria, but to complement them as it focuses the testing on\nimportant code patterns that could go untested otherwise. UCov supports test\ncase intent verification. For example, following a bug fix, the testing team\nmay augment the regression suite with the test case that revealed the bug.\nHowever, this test case might become obsolete due to code modifications not\nrelated to the bug. But if an execution pattern characterizing the bug was\ndefined by the user, UCov would determine that test case intent verification\nfailed. We implemented our methodology for the Java platform and applied it\nonto two real life case studies. Our implementation comprises the following: 1)\nan Eclipse plugin allowing the user to easily specify non-trivial test\nrequirements; 2) the ability of cross referencing test requirements across\nsubsequent versions of a given program; and 3) the ability of checking whether\nuser-defined test requirements were satisfied, i.e., test case intent\nverification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 10:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-14"}

The main objective of\nthis paper is to show how tensor networks can be used to solve a wide class of\nbig data optimization problems (that are far from tractable by classical\nnumerical methods) by applying tensorization and performing all operations\nusing relatively small size matrices and tensors and applying iteratively\noptimized and approximative tensor contractions.\n  Keywords: Tensor networks, tensor train (TT) decompositions, matrix product\nstates (MPS), matrix product operators (MPO), basic tensor operations,\ntensorization, distributed representation od data optimization problems for\nvery large-scale problems: generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD),\nPCA/SVD, canonical correlation analysis (CCA).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 12:08:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 11:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-25"}

Cooling by an applied charge current is a\nparticularly simple and hence attractive strategy to this effect. Here, we\nexplore this phenomenon in the context of the general theory of\nthermoelectrics. In linear response, this theory describes thermoelectric\nrefrigerators in terms of their cooling efficiency and figure of merit ZT. We\nshow that both concepts carry over to phonon cooling in nanoelectromechanical\nsystems. As an important consequence, this allows us to discuss the efficiency\nof phonon refrigerators in relation to the fundamental Carnot efficiency. We\nillustrate these general concepts by thoroughly investigating a simple\ndouble-quantum-dot model with the dual advantage of being quite realistic\nexperimentally and amenable to a largely analytical analysis theoretically.\nSpecifically, we obtain results for the efficiency, the figure of merit, and\nthe effective temperature of the vibrational motion in two regimes. In the\nquantum regime in which the vibrational motion is fast compared to the\nelectronic degrees of freedom, we can describe the electronic and phononic\ndynamics of the model in terms of master equations. In the complementary\nclassical regime of slow vibrational motion, the dynamics is described in terms\nof an appropriate Langevin equation. Remarkably, we find that the efficiency\ncan approach the maximal Carnot value in the quantum regime, with large\nassociated figures of merit. In contrast, the efficiencies are typically far\nfrom the Carnot limit in the classical regime. Our theoretical results should\nprovide guidance to implementing efficient vibrational cooling of\nnanoelectromechanical systems in the laboratory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 12:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

In\nparticular, quantum sensors based on the spin-dependent photoluminescence of\nNitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have recently been used to detect\nnanoscale ensembles of external nuclear spins.

To address this problem, we formulate and study a mathematical model of\nspatio-temporal tumor dynamics where different responses to local cell density\nmediate the go-or-grow dichotomy. Our analysis reveals that two dynamic regimes\ncan be distinguished. If cell motility is allowed to increase with local cell\ndensity, any tumor cell population will persist in time, irrespective of its\ninitial size. On the contrary, if cell motility is assumed to decrease with\nrespect to local cell density, an Allee effect emerges, so that any tumor\npopulation below a certain size threshold eventually extinguishes.

We focus on different\nregimes of quasi-spherical accretion onto a NS: supersonic (Bondi) accretion,\nwhich takes place when the captured matter cools down rapidly and falls\nsupersonically towards the NS magnetosphere, and subsonic (settling) accretion\nwhich occurs when the plasma remains hot until it meets the magnetospheric\nboundary. The two regimes are separated by a limit in X-ray luminosity at about\n4 10^{36} erg/s. In subsonic accretion, which works a hot quasi-spherical shell\nmust form around the magnetosphere, and the actual accretion rate onto the NS\nis determined by the ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere due to\nthe Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Two regimes of subsonic accretion are\npossible, depending on the plasma cooling mechanism (Compton or radiative) near\nthe magnetopshere. The transition from the high-luminosity regime with Compton\ncooling to the low-luminosity (L_x < 3\\times 10^35 erg/s) regime with radiative\ncooling can be responsible for the onset of the 'off' states repeatedly\nobserved in several X-ray pulsars, such as Vela X-1, GX 301-2 and 4U 1907+09.\nThe triggering of the transition may be due to a switch in the X-ray beam\npattern in response to a change in the optical depth in the accretion column\nwith changing luminosity. We also show that in the settling accretion theory,\nbright X-ray flares (10^{38}-10^{40} ergs) observed in SFXT may be produced by\nsporadic capture of magnetized stellar-wind plasma. At sufficiently low\naccretion rates, magnetic reconnection can enhance the magnetospheric plasma\nentry rate, resulting in copious production of X-ray photons, strong Compton\ncooling and ultimately in unstable accretion of the entire shell. A bright\nflare develops on the free-fall time scale in the shell, and the typical energy\nreleased in an SFXT bright flare corresponds to the mass of the shell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 14:02:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 08:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-16"}

If Y satisfies weak algebraic conditions with a single\nbinary operation then a stable set of functions forms an object generalizing an\nideal of a ring. Calling such sets ideals there is a concept of a prime ideal.\nThe ideal of functions vanishing on a quasi-component are prime ideals of\nC(X,Y). If Y has a zero set that is open then these prime ideals are min- max\nimplying that when Y is a ring all of the prime ideals of C(X,Y) are of this\nform and min-max. However this is a study of C(X,Y) and its ideals beginning\nwith a few algebraic hypothesis on Y and adding to them as needed. So there are\nconditions when a prime ideal is minimal, when the set of quasi-components is\nin bijective correspondence with the set of prime ideals of functions which\nvanish on them, when C(X,Y) can not be like a local ring, when the prime (nil)\nradical is trivial, and when the corresponding Spec(C(X,Y)) is a disconnected\ntopological space.

Aims. The aim of this work is to study the dynamics of\nthe prominence fine structures in multiple wavelengths to understand their\nformation. Methods. The spectrographs IRIS and MSDP provided line profiles with\na high cadence in Mg II and in Halpha lines. Results. The magnetic field is\nfound to be globally horizontal with a relatively weak field strength (8-15\nGauss). The Ca II movie reveals turbulent-like motion that is not organized in\nspecific parts of the prominence. On the other hand, the Mg II line profiles\nshow multiple peaks well separated in wavelength. Each peak corresponds to a\nGaussian profile, and not to a reversed profile as was expected by the present\nnon-LTE radiative transfer modeling. Conclusions. Turbulent fields on top of\nthe macroscopic horizontal component of the magnetic field supporting the\nprominence give rise to the complex dynamics of the plasma. The plasma with the\nhigh velocities (70 km/s to 100 km/s if we take into account the transverse\nvelocities) may correspond to condensation of plasma along more or less\nhorizontal threads of the arch-shape structure visible in 304 A. The steady\nflows (5 km/s) would correspond to a more quiescent plasma (cool and\nprominence-corona transition region) of the prominence packed into dips in\nhorizontal magnetic field lines. The very weak secondary peaks in the Mg II\nprofiles may reflect the turbulent nature of parts of the prominence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 14:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

Sunspots\nare believed to result from the eruption of magnetic flux-tubes rising from the\ndeep interior of the Sun.

Using molecular\ndynamics simulations we probe the healing of polymer films and compare the\nresults with those for thermal welding of homopolymer slabs. The two processes\ndiffer in their interfacial structure since damage leads to increased\npolydispersity and more short chains. A polymer sample was cut into two\nseparate films that were then held together in the melt state. The recovery of\nthe damaged film was followed as time elapsed and polymer molecules diffused\nacross the interface. The mass uptake and formation of entanglements, as\nobtained from primitive path analysis, are extracted and correlated with the\ninterfacial strength obtained from shear simulations. We find that the\ninterdiffusion is significantly faster in the damaged film compared to welding\nbecause of the presence of short chains. Though interfacial entanglements\nincrease more rapidly for the damaged films, a large fraction of them are near\nchain ends. As a result, the interfacial strength of the healing film increases\nmore slowly than for welding. For both healing and welding, the interfacial\nstrength saturates as the bulk entanglement density is recovered across the\ninterface. However, the saturation strength of the damaged film is below the\nbulk strength for the polymer sample. At saturation, cut chains remain near the\nhealing interface. They are less entangled and thus mechanically weaken the\ninterface. When the interfacial strength saturates, the number of interfacial\nentanglements scales with the corresponding bulk entanglement density. Chain\nstiffness increases the density of entanglements, which increases the\ninterfacial strength. Our results show that a few entanglements across the\ninterface are sufficient to resist interfacial chain pullout and enhance the\nmechanical strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 15:32:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Here we extend the\nsemi-replication approach of Burgard and Kjaer (2013) and the capital formalism\n(KVA) of Green, Kenyon, and Dennis (2014) to cover credit risk warehousing and\ntax, formalized as double-semi-replication and TVA (Tax Valuation Adjustment)\nto enable quantification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 15:44:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 07:11:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 18:23:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-08"}

Shells appear as glowing arcs around their\nhost galaxy. They are observed up to ~100 kpc. The stars in axially symmetric\nshell systems move in nearly radial orbits. The radial distributions of shell\nlocations and the spectra of stars in shells can be used to constrain the\ngravitational potential of their host galaxy. The symmetrical shell systems,\nbeing especially suitable for these studies, occur in approximately 3% of all\nearly-type galaxies. Hence the shells substantially increase the number of\nellipticals in which MOND can be tested up to large radii. In this paper, we\nreview our work on shell galaxies in MOND. We summarize the paper B\\'{i}lek et\nal. (2013), where we demonstrated the consistency of shell radii in an\nelliptical NGC 3923 with MOND, and the work B\\'{i}lek et al. (2014), in which\nwe predicted a giant (~200 kpc), as yet undiscovered shell of NGC 3923. We\nexplain the shell identification method, which was used in these two papers.

When it is implemented into a legged robot's locomotion control as a\ncentral pattern generator (CPG), sophisticated gait patterns arise so that the\nrobot can perform various walking behaviors. However, such a single chaotic CPG\ncontroller has difficulties dealing with leg malfunction. Specifically, in the\nscenarios presented here, its movement permanently deviates from the desired\ntrajectory. To address this problem, we extend the single chaotic CPG to\nmultiple CPGs with learning. The learning mechanism is based on a simulated\nannealing algorithm. In a normal situation, the CPGs synchronize and their\ndynamics are identical. With leg malfunction or disability, the CPGs lose\nsynchronization leading to independent dynamics. In this case, the learning\nmechanism is applied to automatically adjust the remaining legs' oscillation\nfrequencies so that the robot adapts its locomotion to deal with the\nmalfunction. As a consequence, the trajectory produced by the multiple chaotic\nCPGs resembles the original trajectory far better than the one produced by only\na single CPG. The performance of the system is evaluated first in a physical\nsimulation of a quadruped as well as a hexapod robot and finally in a real\nsix-legged walking machine called AMOSII. The experimental results presented\nhere reveal that using multiple CPGs with learning is an effective approach for\nadaptive locomotion generation where, for instance, different body parts have\nto perform independent movements for malfunction compensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 14:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-02"}
