Using red clump stars as near-infrared\nstandard candles, this work presents the first attempt to decompose the line of\nsight structure of the sky-projected Galactic magnetic field. Two example\nlines-of-sight are decomposed: toward a field with many red clump stars and\ntoward a field with few red clump stars. A continuous estimate of magnetic\nfield orientation over several kiloparsecs of distance is possible in the field\nwith many red clump stars, while only discrete estimates are possible in the\nsparse example. toward the Outer Galaxy, there is a continuous field\norientation with distance that shows evidence of perturbation by the Galactic\nwarp. toward the Inner Galaxy, evidence for a large-scale change in the\nmagnetic field geometry is consistent with models of magnetic field reversals,\nindependently derived from Faraday rotation studies. A photo-polarimetric\nmethod for identifying candidate intrinsically polarized stars is also\npresented.

As a simple example of the construction of the\nperturbed gravitational field with this formalism, we consider the\ngravitational field produced by a rotating circular ring around a Schwarzschild\nblack hole. In the CCK method, the metric is constructed in a radiation gauge\nvia the Hertz potential, which is obtained from the solution of the Teukolsky\nequation.

The ADM algorithms\nare typically short and easy to implement yet exhibit (nearly) state-of-the-art\nperformance for large-scale optimization problems.\n  To apply ADM, we first formulate a given problem into the \"ADM-ready\" form,\nso the final algorithm depends on the formulation.

Specifically, we show that ADM applied to a primal formulation is\nequivalent to ADM applied to its Lagrange dual; ADM is equivalent to a\nprimal-dual algorithm applied to the saddle-point formulation of the same\nproblem. These results are surprising since the primal and dual variables in\nADM are seemingly treated very differently, and some previous work exhibit\npreferences in one over the other on specific problems. In addition, when one\nof the two objective functions is quadratic, possibly subject to an affine\nconstraint, we show that swapping the update order of the two primal variables\nin ADM gives the same algorithm.

An\nentropy function $\\bf h$ is called $p$-symmetrical if for all ${\\cal A},{\\cal\nB} \\subset {\\cal N}$, $\\bf{h}({\\cal A}) = \\bf{h}({\\cal B})$ whenever $|{\\cal A}\n\\cap {\\cal N}_i| = |{\\cal B} \\cap {\\cal N}_i|$, $i = 1, \\cdots,t$. The set of\nall the $p$-symmetrical entropy functions, denoted by $\\Psi^*_p$, is called\n$p$-symmetrical entropy function region. We prove that $\\overline{\\Psi^*_p}$,\nthe closure of $\\Psi^*_p$, is completely characterized by Shannon-type\ninformation inequalities if and only if $p$ is the $1$-partition or a\n$2$-partition with one of its blocks being a singleton.\n  The characterization of the partition-symmetrical entropy functions can be\nuseful for solving some information theory and related problems where symmetry\nexists in the structure of the problems.\n  Keywords: entropy, entropy function, information inequality, polymatroid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 13:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 06:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-29"}

The first\napproach is the standard one and is based on evolution on Cauchy hypersurfaces\nwith artificial timelike boundary. The well posedness of a set of\nconstraint-preserving boundary conditions for the Einstein equations in\ngeneralised harmonic gauge is analysed, their numerical performance is compared\nwith various alternate methods, and improved absorbing boundary conditions are\nconstructed and implemented. In the second approach, one solves the Einstein\nequations on hyperboloidal (asymptotically characteristic) hypersurfaces.

We show how the formally singular\nterms arising in a $3+1$ reduction of the equations can be evaluated at future\nnull infinity, present stable numerical evolutions of vacuum axisymmetric black\nhole spacetimes and study late-time power-law tails of matter fields in\nspherical symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 13:24:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}

The rapid increase in computational power has made it\npossible to probe increasingly complex systems, yet extracting accurate free\nenergies from these simulations remains a major challenge. Fully exploring the\nfree energy landscape of, say, a biological macromolecule typically requires\nsampling large conformational changes and slow transitions. Often, the only\nfeasible way to study such a system is to simulate it using an enhanced\nsampling method. The accelerated weight histogram (AWH) method is a new,\nefficient extended ensemble sampling technique which adaptively biases the\nsimulation to promote exploration of the free energy landscape. The AWH method\nuses a probability weight histogram which allows for efficient free energy\nupdates and results in an easy discretization procedure. A major advantage of\nthe method is its general formulation, making it a powerful platform for\ndeveloping further extensions and analyzing its relation to already existing\nmethods. Here, we demonstrate its efficiency and general applicability by\ncalculating the potential of mean force along a reaction coordinate for both a\nsingle dimension and multiple dimensions. We make use of a non-uniform, free\nenergy dependent target distribution in reaction coordinate space so that\ncomputational efforts are not wasted on physically irrelevant regions.

These weaker guarantees allow programs to exhibit\nbehaviours where the program statements appear to have executed out of program\norder. Fortunately, modern architectures provide memory barriers (fences) to\nenforce the program order between a pair of statements if needed. Due to the\nintricate semantics of weak memory models, the placement of fences is\nchallenging even for experienced programmers. Too few fences lead to bugs\nwhereas overuse of fences results in performance degradation. This motivates\nautomated placement of fences. Tools that restore sequential consistency in the\nprogram may insert more fences than necessary for the program to be correct.\nTherefore, we propose a property-driven technique that introduces\n\"reorder-bounded exploration\" to identify the smallest number of program\nlocations for fence placement. We implemented our technique on top of CBMC;\nhowever, in principle, our technique is generic enough to be used with any\nmodel checker. Our experimental results show that our technique is faster and\nsolves more instances of relevant benchmarks as compared to earlier approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 15:27:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 18:21:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 20:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

We start with\na scheme inspired by Auto-Context, but that is suitable in situations where the\nlack of large training sets poses a potential problem of overfitting. The aim\nis to capture the interactions between neighboring image pixels to better\nregularize the boundaries of segmented regions. As in Auto-Context [Tu et al.,\nPAMI 2009] the segmentation process is iterative and, at each iteration, the\nsegmentation results for the previous iterations are taken into account in\nconjunction with the image itself. However, unlike in [Tu et al., PAMI 2009],\nwe organize our recursion so that the classifiers can progressively focus on\ndifficult-to-classify locations. This lets us exploit the power of the\ndecision-tree paradigm while avoiding over-fitting. In the context of this\narchitecture, KernelBoost represents a powerful building block due to its\nability to learn on the score maps coming from previous iterations. We first\nintroduce two important mechanisms to empower the KernelBoost classifier,\nnamely pooling and the clustering of positive samples based on the appearance\nof the corresponding ground-truth. These operations significantly contribute to\nincrease the effectiveness of the system on biomedical images, where texture\nplays a major role in the recognition of the different image components. We\nthen present some other techniques that can be easily integrated in the\nKernelBoost framework to further improve the accuracy of the final\nsegmentation.

This paper addresses the\napplication of non-parametric image registration techniques to precisely align\nimages obtained from multimodal imaging, which is critical for the successful\nidentification of individual trees using object recognition approaches.\nNon-parametric image registration, in particular the technique of optimizing\none objective function containing data fidelity and regularization terms,\nprovides flexible algorithms for image registration. Using a survey of\nwoodlands in southern Spain as an example, we show that non-parametric image\nregistration can be successful at fusing datasets when there is little prior\nknowledge about how the datasets are interrelated (i.e. in the absence of\nground control points). The validity of non-parametric registration methods in\nairborne remote sensing is demonstrated by a series of experiments. Precise\ndata fusion is a prerequisite to accurate recognition of objects within\nairborne imagery, so non-parametric image registration could make a valuable\ncontribution to the analysis pipeline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 11:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}
