The continuum\nemission shows an unresolved source for which we estimate a mass of gas and\ndust of 30 Mjup, and the CO(3-2) line reveals a compact bipolar outflow centred\non SMM2E, and barely seen also in 13CO(2-1). In addition, C18O(2-1) emission\nreveals hints of a possible rotating envelope/disk perpendicular to the\noutflow, for which we infer a dynamical mass of ~16 Mjup. In order to further\nconstrain the accreted mass of the object, we gathered data from Spitzer,\nHerschel, and new and archive submillimetre observations, and built the\nSpectral Energy Distribution (SED). The SED can be fitted with one single\nmodified black-body from 70 micron down to 2.1 cm, using a dust temperature of\n~24 K, a dust emissivity index of 0.8, and an envelope mass of ~35 Mjup. The\nbolometric luminosity is 0.10 Lsun, and the bolometric temperature is 35 K.\nThus, SMM2E is comparable to the known Class 0 objects in the stellar domain.\nAn estimate of the final mass indicates that SMM2E will most likely remain\nsubstellar, and the SMM2E outflow force matches the trend with luminosity known\nfor young stellar objects. Thus, SMM2E constitutes an excellent example of a\nClass 0 proto-brown dwarf candidate which forms as a scaled-down version of\nlow-mass stars. Finally, SMM2E seems to be part of a wide (~2400 AU) multiple\nsystem of Class 0 sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 16:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Basic properties of individual HI clouds (spin\ntemperature, optical depth, and the column density of the cold and warm neutral\nmedium, CNM and WNM) in and around Perseus are very similar to those found for\nrandom interstellar lines of sight sampled by the Millennium HI survey. This\nsuggests that the neutral gas found in and around molecular clouds is not\natypical.

Our estimated\noptical depth and spin temperature are in stark contrast with the recent\nattempt at using Planck data to estimate properties of the optically thick HI.\nOnly ~15% of lines of sight in our study have a column density weighted average\nspin temperature lower than 50 K, in comparison with >85% of Planck's sky\ncoverage. The observed CNM fraction is inversely proportional to the\noptical-depth weighted average spin temperature, in excellent agreement with\nthe recent numerical simulations by Kim et al. While the CNM fraction is on\naverage higher around Perseus relative to a random interstellar field, it is\ngenerally low, 10-50%.

Small cells enhance the spectrum efficiency and\nthus enlarge the capacity of mobile networks. Although SCBSs consume much less\npower than macro BSs (MBSs) do, the overall power consumption of a large number\nof SCBSs is phenomenal. As the energy harvesting technology advances, base\nstations (BSs) can be powered by green energy to alleviate the on-grid power\nconsumption. For mobile networks with high BS density, traffic load balancing\nis critical in order to exploit the capacity of SCBSs. To fully utilize\nharvested energy, it is desirable to incorporate the green energy utilization\nas a performance metric in traffic load balancing strategies. In this paper, we\nhave proposed a traffic load balancing framework that strives a balance between\nnetwork utilities, e.g., the average traffic delivery latency, and the green\nenergy utilization. Various properties of the proposed framework have been\nderived. Leveraging the software-defined radio access network architecture, the\nproposed scheme is implemented as a virtually distributed algorithm, which\nsignificantly reduces the communication overheads between users and BSs.

More specifically, the\nnetwork's MIMO channels are mathematically decomposed into several effective\nmultiple-input--single-output (MISO) channels, which are essentially spatially\nmultiplexed for transmission. Hence, these effective MISO channels are referred\nto as spatial multiplexing components (SMCs). For the sake of improving the\nSE/ESE performance attained, the SMCs are grouped using a pair of proposed\ngrouping algorithms. The first is optimal in the sense that it exhaustively\nevaluates all the possible combinations of SMCs satisfying both the\nsemi-orthogonality criterion and other relevant system constraints, whereas the\nsecond is a lower-complexity alternative. Corresponding to each of the two\ngrouping algorithms, the pair of SE and ESE maximization problems are\nformulated, thus the optimal SMC groups and optimal power control variables can\nbe obtained for each subcarrier block. These optimization problems are proven\nto be concave, and the dual decomposition approach is employed for obtaining\ntheir solutions. Relying on these optimization solutions, the impact of various\nsystem parameters on both the attainable SE and ESE is characterized. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that under certain conditions the lower-complexity\nSMC grouping algorithm achieves 90% of the SE/ESE attained by the\nexhaustive-search based optimal grouping algorithm, while imposing as little as\n3.5% of the latter scheme's computational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 17:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

The rationale behind the method is the following: (i) had one\nknown the clusters (classes) within the data, one could facilitate further\nanalysis and reduce space dimension by projecting the data to the Fisher's\nlinear subspace, which -- by definition -- preserves the structure of the given\nclasses best (ii) under some reasonable assumptions, this can be done, albeit\napproximately, without the prior knowledge of the clusters (classes). In the\npaper, we show how this approach works. We present a method of preliminary data\ntransformation that brings the directions of largest overall variability close\nto the directions of the best between-class separation.

In the intermediate regime,\nkinematically inferred masses experience an additional radial dependence with\nrespect to the underlying distribution of matter, which is caused by the\nincrement of gravitational forces with increasing distance from the Milky Way\ncenter. The same effect can influence the internal kinematics of subhalos and\ncause cuspy matter distributions to appear core-like. Specializing to the\nchameleon model as a worked example, we demonstrate this effect by tracing the\nscalar field from the outskirts of the Milky Way halo to its interior,\nsimultaneously fitting observed velocity dispersions of chemo-dynamically\ndiscriminated red giant populations in the Fornax and Sculptor dwarf\nspheroidals. Whereas in standard gravity these observations suggest that the\nmatter distribution of the dwarfs is cored, we find that in the presence of a\nchameleon field the assumption of a cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White profile becomes\nperfectly compatible with the data. Importantly, chameleon models also predict\nthe existence of slopes between two stellar subcomponents that in Newtonian\ngravity would be interpreted as a depletion of matter in the dwarf center.\nHence, an observation of such an apparently pathological scenario may serve as\na smoking gun for the presence of a chameleon field or a similar modification\nof gravity, independent of baryonic feedback effects. In general, measuring the\ndynamic mass profiles of the Milky Way dwarfs provides stronger constraints\nthan those inferred from the screening scale of the Solar System since these\nare located at greater distances from the halo center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 20:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-16"}

This demonstrates that the\nprocesses that characterize the canonical star-like mode of formation apply to\nisolated objects down to a few Jupiter masses. We detected in VLT/SINFONI\nspectra that OTS44 has strong, broad, and variable Paschen beta emission. This\nis the first evidence for active accretion of a free-floating planet. The\nobject allows us to study accretion and disk physics at the extreme and can be\nseen as free-floating analog of accreting planets that orbit stars. Our\nanalysis of OTS44 shows that the mass-accretion rate decreases continuously\nfrom stars of several solar masses down to free-floating planets.

We find that planet engulfment during the\nRed Giant Branch is not very sensitive to the stellar mass or mass-loss rates\nadopted in the calculations, but quite sensitive to the planetary mass. The\nrange of initial separations for planet engulfment increases with decreasing\nmass-loss rates or stellar mass and increasing planetary masses. Regarding the\nplanet's orbital eccentricity, we find that as the star evolves into the red\ngiant phase, stellar tides start to dominate over planetary tides. As a\nconsequence, a transient population of moderately eccentric close-in Jovian\nplanets is created, that otherwise would have been expected to be absent from\nmain sequence stars. We find that very eccentric and distant planets do not\nexperience much eccentricity decay, and that planet engulfment is primarily\ndetermined by the pericenter distance and the maximum stellar radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 20:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Reconstructions can be propagated in a form of target\npropagation playing a role similar to back-propagation but helping to reduce\nthe reliance on derivatives in order to perform credit assignment across many\nlevels of possibly strong non-linearities (which is difficult for\nback-propagation). A regularized auto-encoder tends produce a reconstruction\nthat is a more likely version of its input, i.e., a small move in the direction\nof higher likelihood. By generalizing gradients, target propagation may also\nallow to train deep networks with discrete hidden units. If the auto-encoder\ntakes both a representation of input and target (or of any side information) in\ninput, then its reconstruction of input representation provides a target\ntowards a representation that is more likely, conditioned on all the side\ninformation. A deep auto-encoder decoding path generalizes gradient propagation\nin a learned way that can could thus handle not just infinitesimal changes but\nlarger, discrete changes, hopefully allowing credit assignment through a long\nchain of non-linear operations. In addition to each layer being a good\nauto-encoder, the encoder also learns to please the upper layers by\ntransforming the data into a space where it is easier to model by them,\nflattening manifolds and disentangling factors. The motivations and theoretical\njustifications for this approach are laid down in this paper, along with\nconjectures that will have to be verified either mathematically or\nexperimentally, including a hypothesis stating that such auto-encoder mediated\ntarget propagation could play in brains the role of credit assignment through\nmany non-linear, noisy and discrete transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 23:32:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 18:34:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 13:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-19"}

The following data were included in analyses: neighborhood-level\ngeoreferenced dengue cases, national census data, and entomological\nsurveillance data from 2010; time series of weekly dengue cases (aggregated to\nthe city-level) and meteorological data from 2003 to 2012. We applied LISA and\nMorans I to analyze the spatial distribution of the 2010 dengue cases, and\ndeveloped multivariate logistic regression models through a multi-model\nselection process to identify census variables and entomological covariates\nassociated with the presence of dengue at the neighborhood level. Using data\naggregated at the city-level, we conducted a time-series (wavelet) analysis of\nweekly climate and dengue incidence (2003-2012) to identify significant time\nperiods (e.g., annual, biannual) when climate co-varied with dengue, and to\ndescribe the climate conditions associated with the 2010 outbreak. We found\nsignificant hotspots of dengue transmission near the center of Machala. The\nbest-fit model to predict the presence of dengue included older age and female\ngender of the head of the household, greater access to piped water in the home,\npoor housing condition, and less distance to the central hospital. Wavelet\nanalyses revealed that dengue transmission co-varied with rainfall and minimum\ntemperature at annual and biannual cycles, and we found that anomalously high\nrainfall and temperatures were associated with the 2010 outbreak. Our findings\nhighlight the importance of geospatial information in dengue surveillance and\nthe potential to develop a climate-driven spatiotemporal prediction models to\ninform disease prevention and control interventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 01:04:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 00:45:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 17:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

These rules were extended by Macdonald to his now famous\nsymmetric function basis. The original form of these rules had a forbidding\ncomplexity that made them difficult to use in explicit calculations. In the\nearly 90's it was discovered that, due to massive cancellations, the dual rule,\nwhich expresses skewing by $e_1$ the modified Macdonald polynomial ${\\tilde\nH}_\\mu[X;q,t]$, can be given a very simple combinatorial form in terms of\ncorner weights of the Ferrers' diagram of $\\mu$. A similar formula was later\nobtained by the last named author for the multiplication of ${\\tilde\nH}_\\mu[X;q,t]$ by $e_1$, but never published. In the years that followed we\nhave seen some truly remarkable uses of these two Pieri rules in establishing\nhighly non trivial combinatorial results in the Theory of Macdonald\npolynomials. This theory has recently been spectacularly enriched by various\nAlgebraic Geometrical results in the works of Hikita, Schiffmann,\nSchiffmann-Vasserot, A. Negut and Gorsky-Negut.

The\nadvantage is that in the preliminary ABP phase we produce a symbolic plan that\nis a pattern to direct the search of the concrete plan. This can be seen as a\nkind of informed search where the preliminary backward phase is useful to\ndiscover properties of the state-space that can be used to direct the\nsubsequent forward phase.

For small amplitudes, when the instability is in the linear regime, we\ncompare its position and shape to the analytic prediction.

Especially, the\nrole of vegetation in the process of river pattern formation has been explored\nand demonstrated mostly experimentally and numerically until now. In the\npresent work, we shed light on this subject by performing a linear stability\nanalysis on a simple model for riverbed vegetation dynamics coupled with the\nset of classical river morphodynamic equations. The vegetation model only\naccounts for logistic growth, local positive feedback through seeding and\nresprouting, and mortality by means of uprooting through flow shear stress. Due\nto the simplicity of the model, we can transform the set of equations into an\neigenvalue problem and assess the stability of the linearized equations when\nslightly perturbated away from a spatially homogeneous solution. If we couple\nvegetation dynamics with a 1D morphodynamic framework, we observe that\ninstability towards long sediment waves is possible due to competitive\ninteraction between vegetation growth and mortality. Moreover, the domain in\nthe parameter space where perturbations are amplified was found to be simply\nconnected. Subsequently, we proceed to the analysis of vegetation dynamics\ncoupled with a 2D morphodynamic framework, which can be used to evaluate\ninstability towards alternate and multiple bars. It is found that two kinds of\ninstabilities, which are discriminated mainly by the Froude number, occur in a\nconnected domain in the parameter space. At lower Froude number, instability is\nmainly governed by sediment dynamics and leads to the formation of alternate\nand multiple bars while at higher Froude number instability is driven by\nvegetation dynamics, which only allows for alternate bars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 06:17:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 14:06:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-10"}

Such a relation, inspired by an energy landscape analysis,\nimplies that the microcanonical density of states of an O$(n)$ spin model on a\nlattice can be effectively approximated in terms of the density of states of an\nIsing model defined on the same lattice and with the same interactions.

The parent LaSiFe$_{12}$\nalloy has a shallow, double-well free energy function that is the basis of\nitinerant metamagnetism. On increasing the dopant concentration, the resulting\nlattice expansion causes an initial increase in magnetisation for all\ninterstitials that is only maintained at higher levels of doping in the case of\nhydrogen. Strong s-p band hybridisation occurs at high B,C and N\nconcentrations. We thus find that the electronic effects of hydrogen doping are\nmuch less pronounced than those of other interstitials, and result in the\ndouble-well structure of the free energy function being least sensitive to the\namount of hydrogen. This microscopic picture accounts for the vanishing first\norder nature of the transition by B,C, and N dopants as observed\nexperimentally. We use our calculated electronic density of states for\nLaSiFe$_{12}$ and the hydrogenated alloy to infer changes in magneto-elastic\ncoupling and in phonon entropy on heating through $T_C$ by calculating the\nfermionic entropy due to the itinerant electrons.

CALR\nassociated with negative index materials was discovered by Milton and\nNicorovicci in [21] and attracted a lot attention in the scientific community.\nTwo key figures of this phenomenon are the localized resonance, i.e., the\nfields blow up in some regions and remain bounded in some others, and the\nconnection between the localized resonance and the blow up of the power of the\nfields as the loss goes to 0. An important class of negative index materials\nfor which the localized resonance might appear is the class of reflecting\ncomplementary media introduced in [24]. It was showed in [29] that\ncomplementary property of media is not enough to ensure a connection between\nthe blow up of the power and the localized resonance. In this paper, we study\nCALR for a subclass of complementary media called the class of doubly\ncomplementary media. This class is rich enough to allow us to cloak an\narbitrary source concentrating on an arbitrary smooth bounded manifold of\ncodimension 1 placed in an arbitrary medium via anomalous localized resonance.\nThe following three properties are established for doubly complementary media:\n1) CALR appears if and only if the power blows up; 2) The power blows up if the\nsource is near the plasmonic structure; 3) The power remains bounded if the\nsource is far away from the plasmonic structure.

Clear trends were observed across the series.\nSolute-defect interactions were strongly correlated to the solute size factors,\nconsistent with local strain field effects. Strong correlations with results in\nferrite show insensitivity to the underlying crystal structure in Fe. Oversized\nsolutes act as strong traps for vacancy and self-interstitial defects and as\nnucleation sites for the development of proto-voids and small self-interstitial\nloops. The reduction in defect mobility and net defect concentrations explains\nthe observed radiation-damage resistance in austenitic steels doped with\noversized solutes. Oversized solutes remaining dissolved in oxide\ndispersion-strengthened (ODS) steels could contribute to their radiation-damage\nresistance. Ni and Co diffuse more slowly than Fe, along with any vacancy flux\nproduced under irradiation below a critical temperature, which is 400 K for Co\nand their concentrations should be enhanced at defect sinks. Cr and Cu diffuse\nmore quickly than Fe, against a vacancy flux and will be depleted at defect\nsinks. Oversized solutes early in the transition metal series form\nhighly-stable solute-centred divacancy (SCD) defects with a nearest-neighbour\nvacancy. The vacancy-mediated diffusion of these solutes is dominated by the\ndissociation and reassociation of the SCDs, with a lower activation energy than\nfor self-diffusion, which has important implications for the nucleation and\ngrowth of complex oxide nanoparticles containing these solutes in ODS steels.\nInterstitial-mediated solute diffusion is energetically disfavoured for all\nexcept Cr, Mn, Co and Ni.

Here, we examined whether slow oscillations can be effectively\ninduced by rhythmic acoustic stimulation. Human subjects were examined in three\nconditions: (i) with tones presented at a rate of 0.8 Hz (`0.8-Hz\nstimulation'); (ii) with tones presented at a random sequence (`random\nstimulation'); and (iii) with no tones presented in a control condition\n(`sham').

Sleep after the 90-min period of\nstimulation did not differ between the conditions. Our data show that rhythmic\nacoustic stimulation can be used to effectively enhance slow oscillation\nactivity. However, the effect depends on the brain state, requiring the\npresence of stable non-rapid eye movement sleep.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 11:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-31"}

Some people write their passwords down but these records can\neasily be lost or stolen. The option we explore is to find a way to cue\npasswords securely. The specific cueing technique we report on in this paper\nemploys images as cues. The idea is to elicit textual descriptions of the\nimages, which can then be used as passwords. We have defined a set of metrics\nfor the kind of image that could function effectively as a password cue. We\nidentified five candidate image types and ran an experiment to identify the\nimage class with the best performance in terms of the defined metrics.\n  The first experiment identified inkblot-type images as being superior. We\ntested this image, called a cueblot, in a real-life environment. We allowed\nusers to tailor their cueblot until they felt they could describe it, and they\nthen entered a description of the cueblot as their password. The cueblot was\ndisplayed at each subsequent authentication attempt to cue the password.\nUnfortunately, we found that users did not exploit the cueing potential of the\ncueblot, and while there were a few differences between textual descriptions of\ncueblots and non-cued passwords, they were not compelling. Hence our attempts\nto alleviate the difficulties people experience with passwords, by giving them\naccess to a tailored cue, did not have the desired effect. We have to conclude\nthat the password mechanism might well be unable to benefit from bolstering\nactivities such as this one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 11:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 2014 09:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-12"}

The provision of\ncues that would only be helpful to the PIN owner is challenging because the cue\nshould only make sense to the legitimate user, and not to a random observer. In\nthis paper we report on an empirical study where we added colour to the PINpad\nto provide an implicit memory cue to PINpad users.

Given a classification problem, and a classifier trained on a small\nnumber of labelled examples, consider the selection of a single further\nexample. This example will be labelled by the oracle and then used to retrain\nthe classifier. This example selection raises a central question: given a fully\nspecified stochastic description of the classification problem, which example\nis the optimal selection? If optimality is defined in terms of loss, this\ndefinition directly produces expected loss reduction (ELR), a central quantity\nwhose maximum yields the optimal example selection. This work presents a new\ntheoretical approach to AL, example quality, which defines optimal AL behaviour\nin terms of ELR. Once optimal AL behaviour is defined mathematically, reasoning\nabout this abstraction provides insights into AL. In a theoretical context the\noptimal selection is compared to existing AL methods, showing that heuristics\ncan make sub-optimal selections.

Since, in the frictionless case, these markets admit arbitrage,\nwe aim to determine the size of the transaction costs needed to eliminate the\narbitrage from these models. To gain more insight, we first consider only\n1-step trading strategies and we prove that arbitrage opportunities appear when\nthe transaction costs are of order $o(1/\\sqrt{N})$. Next, we characterize the\nasymptotic behavior of the smallest transaction costs $\\lambda_c^{(N)}$, called\n\"critical\" transaction costs, starting from which the arbitrage disappears.\nSince the fractional Black-Scholes model is arbitrage-free under arbitrarily\nsmall transaction costs, one could expect that $\\lambda_c^{(N)}$ converges to\nzero. However, the true behavior of $\\lambda_c^{(N)}$ is opposed to this\nintuition. More precisely, we show, with the help of a new family of trading\nstrategies, that $\\lambda_c^{(N)}$ converges to one. We explain this apparent\ncontradiction and conclude that it is appropriate to see the fractional binary\nmarkets as a large financial market and to study its asymptotic arbitrage\nopportunities. Finally, we construct a $1$-step asymptotic arbitrage in this\nlarge market when the transaction costs are of order $o(1/N^H)$, whereas for\nconstant transaction costs, we prove that no such opportunity exists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 14:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-05"}

This approach minimises the\nparallelisation overhead yet displays highly desirable theoretical properties.\nUnder very mild assumptions, we analyse the mean square error (MSE) of the\nestimators of 1-dimensional statistics of the optimal filtering distribution\nand show explicitly the effect of parallelisation scheme on the convergence\nrate. Specifically, we study the decomposition of the MSE into variance and\nbias components, to show that the former decays as $\\frac{1}{MN}$, i.e.,\nlinearly with the total number of particles, while the latter converges towards\n$0$ as $\\frac{1}{N^2}$.

In 2009, the same author introduced a new class of zeta\nfunctions, called `distance zeta functions', which since then, has enabled us\nto extend the existing theory of zeta functions of fractal strings and sprays\nto arbitrary bounded (fractal) sets in Euclidean spaces of any dimension. A\nnatural and closely related tool for the study of distance zeta functions is\nthe class of 'tube zeta functions', defined using the tube function of a\nfractal set. These three classes of zeta functions, under the name of 'fractal\nzeta functions', exhibit deep connections with Minkowski contents and upper box\ndimensions, as well as, more generally, with the complex dimensions of fractal\nsets. Further extensions include zeta functions of relative fractal drums, the\nbox dimension of which can assume negative values, including minus infinity. We\nalso survey some results concerning the existence of the meromorphic extensions\nof the spectral zeta functions of fractal drums, based in an essential way on\nearlier results of the first author on the spectral (or eigenvalue) asymptotics\nof fractal drums. It follows from these results that the associated spectral\nzeta function has a (nontrivial) meromorphic extension, and we use some of our\nresults about fractal zeta functions to show the new fact according to which\nthe upper bound obtained for the corresponding abscissa of meromorphic\nconvergence is optimal.

The currents\nare induced by magnetic fluxes running along the cosmic string and enclosed by\nthe compact dimension.

By using the Abel-Plana summation formula, the\nazimuthal and axial currents are explicitly decomposed into two parts: the\nfirst one corresponds to the geometry of a straight cosmic string and the\nsecond one is induced by the compactification of the string along its axis. For\nthe axial current the first part vanishes and the corresponding topological\npart is an even periodic function of the magnetic flux along the string axis\nand an odd periodic function of the flux enclosed by the compact dimension with\nthe periods equal to the flux quantum. The azimuthal current density is an odd\nperiodic function of the flux along the string axis and an even periodic\nfunction of the flux enclosed by the compact dimension with the same period.\nDepending on the magnetic fluxes, the planar angle deficit can either enhance\nor reduce the azimuthal and axial currents. The influence of the background\ngravitational field on the vacuum currents is crucial at distances from the\nstring larger than the de Sitter curvature radius.

Existing models either (i) describe\nprotocell architecture and dynamics, given the existence of sets of\ncollectively self-replicating molecules for granted, or (ii) describe the\nemergence of the aforementioned sets from an ensemble of random molecules in a\nsimple experimental setting (e.g. a closed system or a steady-state flow\nreactor) that does not properly describe a protocell. In this paper we present\na model that goes beyond these limitations by describing the dynamics of sets\nof replicating molecules within a lipid vesicle. We adopt the simplest possible\nprotocell architecture, by considering a semi-permeable membrane that selects\nthe molecular types that are allowed to enter or exit the protocell and by\nassuming that the reactions take place in the aqueous phase in the internal\ncompartment. As a first approximation, we ignore the protocell growth and\ndivision dynamics. The behavior of catalytic reaction networks is then\nsimulated by means of a stochastic model that accounts for the creation and the\nextinction of species and reactions. While this is not yet an exhaustive\nprotocell model, it already provides clues regarding some processes that are\nrelevant for understanding the conditions that can enable a population of\nprotocells to undergo evolution and selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 15:53:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-01"}

These wireless mesh networks, formed by\nlow-power radio transceivers, continuously measure the received signal strength\n(RSS) of the links. Radio Tomographic Imaging (RTI) is a technique that\ngenerates 2D images of the change in the electromagnetic field inside the area\ncovered by the radio transceivers to spot the presence and movements of\nanimates (e.g., people, large animals) or large metallic objects (e.g., cars).\nHere, we present a RTI system for localizing and tracking people outdoors.\nDifferently than in indoor environments where the RSS does not change\nsignificantly with time unless people are found in the monitored area, the\noutdoor RSS signal is time-variant, e.g., due to rainfalls or wind-driven\nfoliage. We present a novel outdoor RTI method that, despite the nonstationary\nnoise introduced in the RSS data by the environment, achieves high localization\naccuracy and dramatically reduces the energy consumption of the sensing units.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the system accurately detects and tracks\na person in real-time in a large forested area under varying environmental\nconditions, significantly reducing false positives, localization error and\nenergy consumption compared to state-of-the-art RTI methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 09:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-01"}
