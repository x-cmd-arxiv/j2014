Here we\nstudied NGC6705, that is a young and massive open cluster located towards the\ninner region of the Milky Way. This cluster is located inside the solar circle.\nThis makes it an important tracer of the inner disk abundance gradient. This\nstudy makes use of BVI and ri photometry and comparisons with theoretical\nisochrones to derive the age of NGC6705. We study the density profile of the\ncluster and the mass function to infer the cluster mass. Based on abundances of\nthe chemical elements distributed in the first internal data release of the\nGaia-ESO Survey, we study elemental ratios and the chemical homogeneity of the\nred clump stars. Radial velocities enable us to study the rotation and internal\nkinematics of the cluster.\n  The estimated ages range from 250 to 316Myr, depending on the adopted stellar\nmodel. Luminosity profiles and mass functions show strong signs of mass\nsegregation. We derive the mass of the cluster from its luminosity function and\nfrom the kinematics, finding values between 3700 M$_{\\odot}$ and 11 000\nM$_{\\odot}$. After selecting the cluster members from their radial velocities,\nwe obtain a metallicity of [Fe/H]=0.10$\\pm$0.06 based on 21 candidate members.\nMoreover, NGC6705 shows no sign of the typical correlations or\nanti-correlations between Al, Mg, Si, and Na, that are expected in multiple\npopulations. This is consistent with our cluster mass estimate, which is lower\nthan the required mass limit proposed in literature to develop multiple\npopulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jul 2014 16:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-10"}

For example, magnetic resonance imaging is based on\nthe dependence of the spin relaxation times of protons in water molecules in a\nhost's tissue. Here we show that the excitation energy of a single spin, which\nis determined by magnetocrystalline anisotropy and controls its stability and\nsuitability for use in magnetic data storage devices, can be modified by\nvarying the exchange coupling of the spin to a nearby conductive electrode.\nUsing scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we observe variations up\nto a factor of two of the spin excitation energies of individual atoms as the\nstrength of the spin's coupling to the surrounding electronic bath changes.\nThese observations, combined with calculations, show that exchange coupling can\nstrongly modify the magnetic anisotropy. This system is thus one of the few\nopen quantum systems in which the energy levels, and not just the excited-state\nlifetimes, can be controllably renormalized.

It may indicate that either LBs do not affect umbral\noscillations, or umbral oscillations at different umbral cores share the same\nsource. Also, it indicates that LBs are rather shallow objects situated in the\nupper part of the umbra. We found that umbral flashes follow the life cycles of\numbral oscillations with much larger amplitudes. They cannot propagate across\nLBs. Umbral flashes dominate the 3-min oscillation power within each core,\nhowever, they do not disrupt the phase of umbral oscillation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jul 2014 20:50:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In this paper, we\nreport studies on the resilience or robustness of this modular structure: under\nsystematic erosion of connectivity in the network under thresholding, how\nresilient is the modularity and hub structure? The results show that the\nnetwork shows show strong resilience properties, with the modularity and hub\nstructure maintaining itself over a large range of connection strengths. Then,\nat a certain critical threshold that falls very close to 0, the connectivity,\nthe modularity, and hub structure suddenly break down, showing a phase\ntransition like property. Additionally, the spatial and topological\norganization of erosion of connectivity at all levels was found to be\nhomogenous rather than heterogenous; i.e., no \"structural holes\" of any\nsignificant sizes were found, and no gradual increases in numbers of components\nwere detected. Any loss of connectivity is homogenously spread out across the\nnetwork.

Presently, molecule-based devices are also considered for quantum\ncomputation hardware. The recent studies have shown the molecule connected to\nmetal leads can perform the qubit-based logic operation. This is an interesting\nquestion of why experimental progress is still very slow even when the scope of\nmolecule-based devices may govern the advancement of next-generation logic and\nmemory devices for the highest possible computer technologies. Molecules have\nthe potential to be unmatched device elements as chemists can mass-produce an\nendless variety of molecules with novel optical, magnetic, and charge transport\ncharacteristics. However, the biggest challenge is to connect two metal leads\nto target molecules and develop a robust and versatile device fabrication\ntechnology that can be adopted for commercial-scale mass production. This paper\ndiscusses the distinct advantages of utilizing commercially successful magnetic\ntunnel junctions as a vehicle for developing molecular electronics and\nmolecular spintronics devices. We describe the use of a tunnel junction with\nthe exposed sides as a testbed for molecular devices. On the exposed sides of a\ntunnel, junction molecules are bridged across an insulator by chemically\nbonding with the two metal electrodes; sequential growth of\nmetal-insulator-metal layers ensures that separation between two metal\nelectrodes is controlled by the insulator thickness to the molecular device\nlength scale. Here we also strongly emphasize a need for close collaboration\nbetween chemists and magnetic tunnel junction researchers. Such partnerships\nwill have a strong potential to develop magnetic tunnel junction based\nmolecular devices for the futuristic areas such as memory devices, magnetic\nmetamaterials, and high sensitivity biosensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Jul 2014 22:15:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 2019 10:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-04"}

This chapter delivers a review of recent\nadvances in the field where the regularization prior promotes solutions\nconforming to some notion of simplicity/low-complexity.

Of interest is the\npotential to leverage on such latent flexibility in demand to absorb\nvariability in power supplied from intermittent renewable generation. The\nchallenge, however, lies in designing incentives to reliably induce the desired\nresponse in demand. With an eye to electric vehicle charging, we propose a\nnovel forward market for differentiated electric power services, where\nconsumers consent to deferred service of pre-specified loads in exchange for a\nreduced per-unit price for energy. The longer a consumer is willing to defer,\nthe larger the reduction in price. The proposed forward contract provides a\nguarantee on the aggregate quantity of energy to be delivered by a\nconsumer-specified deadline. Under the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling\npolicy, which is shown to be optimal for the supplier, we explicitly\ncharacterize a non-discriminatory, deadline-differentiated pricing scheme that\nyields an efficient competitive equilibrium between the supplier and consumers.\nWe further show that this efficient pricing scheme, in combination with EDF\nscheduling, is incentive compatible (IC) in that every consumer would like to\nreveal her true deadline to the supplier, regardless of the actions taken by\nother consumers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 07:01:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 05:11:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 05:55:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2016 13:31:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2016 12:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-23"}

This entails that in the\nWilsonian RG approach, the decimation is effectuated in the baryonic sector to\nthe Fermi surface while in the meson sector to the origin. In writing the\nkaon-baryon (KN) coupling, we will take a generalized hidden local symmetry\nLagrangian for the meson sector endowed with a \"mended symmetry\" that has the\nunbroken symmetry limit at high density in which the Goldstone $\\pi$, scalar\n$s$, and vectors $\\rho$ (and $\\omega$) and $a_1$ become massless. The vector\nmesons $\\rho$ (and $\\omega$) and $a_1$ can be identified as emergent (hidden)\nlocal gauge fields and the scalar $s$ as the dilaton field of the spontaneously\nbroken scale invariance at chiral restoration. In matter-free space, when the\nvector mesons and the scalar meson -- whose masses are much greater than that\nof the pion -- are integrated out, then the resulting KN coupling Lagrangian\nconsists of the leading chiral order ($O(p^1)$) Weinberg-Tomozawa term and the\nnext chiral order ($O(p^2)$) $\\Sigma_{KN}$ term. In addressing kaon\ncondensation in dense nuclear matter in chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), one\nmakes an expansion in the \"small\" Fermi momentum $k_F$. We argue that in the\nWilsonian RG formalism with the Fermi-liquid fixed point, the expansion is on\nthe contrary in $1/k_F$ with the \"large\" Fermi momentum $k_F$. The\nkaon-quasinucleon interaction resulting from integrating out the massive mesons\nconsists of a \"relevant\" term from the scalar exchange (analog to the\n$\\Sigma_{KN}$ term) and an \"irrelevant\" term from the vector-meson exchange\n(analog to the Weinberg-Tomozawa term).

In this paper we discuss\nthe influence of two physical phenomena, interstellar magnetic fields and the\npresence of interstellar dust grains on the observable shape of the bow shocks\nof massive stars.\n  We find that the interstellar magnetic field, though too weak to restrict the\ngeneral shape of the bow shock, reduces the size of the instabilities that\nwould otherwise be observed in the bow shock of a red supergiant. The\ninterstellar dust grains, due to their inertia can penetrate deep into the bow\nshock structure of a main sequence O-supergiant, crossing over from the ISM\ninto the stellar wind. Therefore, the dust distribution may not always reflect\nthe morphology of the gas. This is an important consideration for infrared\nobservations, which are dominated by dust emission.\n  Our models clearly show, that the bow shocks of massive stars are useful\ndiagnostic tools that can used to investigate the properties of both the\nstellar wind as well as the interstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 08:31:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Prior\nwork has demonstrated the benefits of in-network content caching in a wired,\nInternet context. We investigate the problem of developing optimal routing and\ncaching policies in a hybrid network supporting in-network caching with the\ngoal of minimizing overall content-access delay. Here, needed content may\nalways be accessed at a back-end server via the cellular infrastructure;\nalternatively, content may also be accessed via cache-equipped \"cluster\" nodes\nwithin the MANET. To access content, MANET nodes must thus decide whether to\nroute to in-MANET cluster nodes or to back-end servers via the cellular\ninfrastructure; the in-MANET cluster nodes must additionally decide which\ncontent to cache. We model the cellular path as either i) a\ncongestion-insensitive fixed-delay path or ii) a congestion-sensitive path\nmodeled as an M/M/1 queue. We demonstrate that under the assumption of\nstationary, independent requests, it is optimal to adopt static caching (i.e.,\nto keep a cache's content fixed over time) based on content popularity. We also\nshow that it is optimal to route to in-MANET caches for content cached there,\nbut to route requests for remaining content via the cellular infrastructure for\nthe congestion-insensitive case and to split traffic between the in-MANET\ncaches and cellular infrastructure for the congestion-sensitive case.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the polarization properties of the synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC)\nprocess from a highly relativistic jet. A magnetic-dominated, baryon-loaded jet\nejected from the central engine travels with a large Lorentz factor. Shells\nwith slightly different velocities collide with each other and produce shocks.\nThe shocks accelerate electrons to power-law distribution, and at the same\ntime, magnify the magnetic field. Electrons move in the magnetic field and\nproduce synchrotron photons. The synchrotron photons suffer from the Compton\nscattering (CS) process and then are detected by an observer locating slightly\noff-axis. We derive analytically the formulae of photon polarization in the SSC\nprocess in two magnetic configurations: magnetic field in the shock plane and\nperpendicular to the shock plane. We show that photons induced by the SSC\nprocess can be highly polarized, with the maximum polarization $\\Pi \\sim 24\\%$\nin the energy band $[0.5,5]$ MeV. The polarization depends on the viewing\nangles, peaking in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. In the energy\nband $[0.05,0.5]$ MeV, in which most $\\gamma$-ray polarimeters are active, the\npolarization is about twice of that in the Thomson limit, reaching to $\\Pi\\sim\n20\\%$.

However, lack of sufficient flow-level\nmeasurements as well as potential anomalies pose major challenges towards this\ngoal. Leveraging the spatiotemporal correlation of nominal traffic, and the\nsparse nature of anomalies, this paper brings forth a novel framework to map\nout nominal and anomalous traffic, which treats jointly important network\nmonitoring tasks including traffic estimation, anomaly detection, and traffic\ninterpolation. To this end, a convex program is first formulated with nuclear\nand $\\ell_1$-norm regularization to effect sparsity and low rank for the\nnominal and anomalous traffic with only the link counts and a {\\it small}\nsubset of OD-flow counts. Analysis and simulations confirm that the proposed\nestimator can {\\em exactly} recover sufficiently low-dimensional nominal\ntraffic and sporadic anomalies so long as the routing paths are sufficiently\n\"spread-out\" across the network, and an adequate amount of flow counts are\nrandomly sampled. The results offer valuable insights about data acquisition\nstrategies and network scenaria giving rise to accurate traffic estimation. For\npractical networks where the aforementioned conditions are possibly violated,\nthe inherent spatiotemporal traffic patterns are taken into account by adopting\na Bayesian approach along with a bilinear characterization of the nuclear and\n$\\ell_1$ norms. The resultant nonconvex program involves quadratic regularizers\nwith correlation matrices, learned systematically from (cyclo)stationary\nhistorical data. Alternating-minimization based algorithms with provable\nconvergence are also developed to procure the estimates. Insightful tests with\nsynthetic and real Internet data corroborate the effectiveness of the novel\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 10:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-08"}

However, there are many\nphysical examples where the dynamics is continuous and only approximately\ndiscrete, or where it is favourable to discuss the dynamics on a discretized\nand a continuous level in parallel. An example is the hindered motion of\nparticles through potential landscapes with barriers. In the present paper we\npropose a consistent generalisation of the WTD from the discrete case to\nsituations where the particles perform continuous barrier-crossing\ncharacterised by a finite duration. To this end, we introduce a recipe to\ncalculate the WTD from the Fokker-Planck/Smoluchowski equation. In contrast to\nthe closely related first passage time distribution (FPTD), which is frequently\nused to describe continuous processes, the WTD contains information about the\ndirection of motion. As an application, we consider the paradigmatic example of\nan overdamped particle diffusing through a washboard potential. To verify the\napproach and to elucidate its numerical implications, we compare the WTD\ndefined via the Smoluchowski equation with data from direct simulation of the\nunderlying Langevin equation and find full consistency provided that the jumps\nin the Langevin approach are defined properly. Moreover, for sufficiently large\nenergy barriers, the WTD defined via the Smoluchowski equation becomes\nconsistent with that resulting from the analytical solution of a (two-state)\nmaster equation model for the short-time dynamics developed previous by us [PRE\n86, 061135 (2012)]. Thus, our approach \"interpolates\" between these two types\nof stochastic motion. We illustrate our approach for both symmetric systems and\nsystems under constant force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 11:48:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 09:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-17"}

In this paper we continue the\ndiscussion concerning the effects of non-linear, time-dependent synchrotron\nself-Compton (SSC) cooling. In previous papers we were able to show that the\nnon-linearity{, introduced by a time-dependent electron injection,} has severe\nconsequences for both the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the\nmonochromatic synchrotron light curve. The non-linear cooling introduces novel\nbreaks in the SED, which are usually explained by complicated underlying\nelectron distributions, while the much faster cooling of the SSC process\n{causes significant differences in the synchrotron light curves}. In this paper\nwe calculate the inverse Compton light curves, taking into account both the SSC\nand the external Compton process. The light curves are calculated from the\nmonochromatic intensities by introducing the retardation due to the finite size\nof the emission region and the geometry of the source. Even though some of the\nobvious effects of the SSC cooling are washed out by the retardation, there are\nstill several observational constraints which could help to discriminate\nbetween the non-linear and the usual linear models, such as different flux\nstates, temporal shapes or faster variability of the light curves at different\nenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 12:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In\nparticular, we introduce a novel neural network architecture called KNET that\nleverages both contextual information and morphological word similarity built\nbased on morphological knowledge to learn word embeddings. Meanwhile, the\nlearning architecture is also able to refine the pre-defined morphological\nknowledge and obtain more accurate word similarity.

The LBV phase of evolution\nis poorly understood, and the driving mechanisms for the variability are not\nknown. The most common type of variability, the S Dor instability, occurs on\ntimescales of tens of years. During an S Dor outburst, the visual magnitude of\nthe star increases, while the bolometric magnitude stays approximately\nconstant. In this work, we investigate pulsation as a possible trigger for the\nS Dor type outbursts. We calculate the pulsations of envelope models using a\nnonlinear hydrodynamics code including a time-dependent convection treatment.\nWe initialize the pulsation in the hydrodynamic model based on linear\nnon-adiabatic calculations. Pulsation properties for a full grid of models from\n20 to 85 M$_{\\odot}$ were calculated, and in this paper we focus on the few\nmodels that show either long-period pulsations or outburst-like behaviour, with\nphotospheric radial velocities reaching 70-80 km/s. At the present time, our\nmodels cannot follow mass loss, so once the outburst event begins, our\nsimulations are terminated. Our results show that pulsations alone are not able\nto drive enough surface expansion to eject the outer layers. However, the\noutbursts and long-period pulsations discussed here produce large variations in\neffective temperature and luminosity, which are expected to produce large\nvariations in the radiatively driven mass-loss rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 12:53:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2014 12:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This approach is applicable to not only simple\nlattices but also complex lattices. Firstly, we evaluate the convex hulls for\nbinary alloys with four types of simple lattice. Then we discuss the structures\non the vertices. To examine the accuracy of this approach, we perform a set of\ndensity functional theory calculations and the cluster expansion for Ag-Au\nalloy and compare the formation energies of the vertex structures with those of\nall possible structures. As applications, the ground-state structures of the\nintermetallic compounds CuAu, CuAg, CuPd, AuAg, AuPd, AgPd, MoTa, MoW and TaW\nare similarly evaluated.

A general criterion is provided to easily\nidentify whether given symmetric states are maximally entangled in that respect\nor not. We show that these maximally entangled symmetric (MES) states are the\nonly symmetric states for which the expectation value of the associated\ncollective spin of the system vanishes, as well as in corollary the dipole\nmoment of the Husimi function. We establish the link between this kind of\nmaximal entanglement, the anticoherence properties of spin states, and the\ndegree of polarization of light fields. We analyze the relationship between the\nMES states and the classes of states equivalent through stochastic local\noperations with classical communication (SLOCC).

The 4-qubit system is analyzed exhaustively and all MES\nstates of this system are identified and characterized. Finally the\nentanglement content of MES states is analyzed with respect to the geometric\nand barycentric measures of entanglement, as well as to the generalized\nN-tangle.

When the number of categories of the responses increases,\nthe number of global odds ratios (or their re-parametrizations) to be estimated\nalso increases and estimating the association structure becomes crucial for\nthis type of data. In fact, such data could be too \"rich\" to be fully modelled\nwith an ordinary BOLM while, sometimes, the well-known Dale's model could be\ntoo parsimonious to provide a good fit. In addition, when the cross-tabulation\nof the responses contains some zeros, for a number of model configurations,\nincluding the bivariate version of the partial proportional odds model (PPOM),\nestimation of a BOLM by the Fisher-scoring algorithm may either fail or\nestimate a too \"irregular\" association structure. In this work, we propose to\nuse a nonparametric approach for the maximum likelihood estimation of a BOLM.\nWe apply penalties to the differences between adjacent row and column effects.\nAs a result, estimation is less demanding than an ordinary BOLM, permitting the\nfit of PPOMs and/or the smoothing of the marginal and association parameters by\npolynomial curves and surfaces, with scores chosen by the data. Model selection\nis based on the penalized log-likelihood ratio, whose limiting distribution has\nbeen studied through simulations, and AIC. Our proposal is compared to the\nGoodman's model and the Dale's model, in terms of goodness-of-fit and\nparsimony, on a literature data set. Finally, an application on an original\ndata set of liver disease patients is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 15:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-08"}

Therapies are administered following the 'maximum dose in minimum\ntime' principle, what is the same schedule used for high grade brain tumors.\nUsing mathematical models describing the growth of these tumors in response to\nradiotherapy, we find that a extreme protraction therapeutical strategy, i.e.\nenlarging substantially the time interval between RT fractions, may lead to a\nbetter tumor control. Explicit formulas are found providing the optimal spacing\nbetween doses in a very good agreement with the simulations of the full\nthree-dimensional mathematical model approximating the tumor spatio-temporal\ndynamics. This idea, although breaking the well-stablished paradigm, has\nbiological meaning since in these slowly growing tumors it may be more\nfavourable to treat the tumor as the different tumor subpopulations move to\nmore sensitive phases of the cell cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 14:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-09"}
