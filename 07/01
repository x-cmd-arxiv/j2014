The elimination of the\nunknown boundary values is frequently addressed in the spectral domain via the\nso-called global relation, and types of boundary conditions for which the\nglobal relation can be solved are called \\emph{linearizable}.

In conditions close to molecular condensation, one would expect\nan appearance of a local minimum in the interaction potential between the two\nmolecules. We investigate this situation, introducing an attractive component\ninto the interaction potential, using a model developed for describing such\nexperiments. We consider attraction that does not depend on molecular\nstructure, as well that which depends on a DNA-like helix structure. In\nbraiding experiments, an attractive term may lead to certain effects. A local\nminimum may cause molecules to collapse from a loosely braided configuration\ninto a tight one, occurring at a critical value of the moment applied about the\naxis of the braid. For a fixed number of braid pitches, this may lead to\ncoexistence between the two braiding states, tight and loose. Coexistence\nimplies certain proportions of the braid are in each state, their relative size\ndepending on the number of braid pitches. This manifests itself as linear\ndependence in numerically calculated quantities as functions of the number of\nbraid pitches. Also, in the collapsed state, the braid radius stays roughly\nconstant. Furthermore, if the attractive interaction is helix dependent, the\nleft-right handed braid symmetry is broken. For a DNA like charge distribution,\nusing the Kornyshev-Leikin interaction model, our results suggest that\nsignificant braid collapse and coexistence only occurs for left handed braids.\nRegardless of the interaction model, the study highlights the possible\nqualitative physics of braid collapse and coexistence; and the role helix\nspecific forces might play, if important.

We report DNN classifier performance and final\nspeech recognizer word error rates, and compare DNNs using several metrics to\nquantify factors influencing differences in task performance. Our first set of\nexperiments use the standard Switchboard benchmark corpus, which contains\napproximately 300 hours of conversational telephone speech. We compare standard\nDNNs to convolutional networks, and present the first experiments using\nlocally-connected, untied neural networks for acoustic modeling. We\nadditionally build systems on a corpus of 2,100 hours of training data by\ncombining the Switchboard and Fisher corpora. This larger corpus allows us to\nmore thoroughly examine performance of large DNN models -- with up to ten times\nmore parameters than those typically used in speech recognition systems. Our\nresults suggest that a relatively simple DNN architecture and optimization\ntechnique produces strong results. These findings, along with previous work,\nhelp establish a set of best practices for building DNN hybrid speech\nrecognition systems with maximum likelihood training. Our experiments in DNN\noptimization additionally serve as a case study for training DNNs with\ndiscriminative loss functions for speech tasks, as well as DNN classifiers more\ngenerally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 16:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 07:44:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-21"}

First, R\\'enyi's notion of\ninformation dimension (ID) is generalized to analog stationary processes. This\nprovides a measure of complexity for such processes and is connected to the\nnumber of measurements required for their accurate recovery. Then a minimum\nentropy pursuit (MEP) optimization approach is proposed, and it is proven that\nit can reliably recover any stationary process satisfying some mixing\nconstraints from sufficient number of randomized linear measurements, without\nhaving any prior information about the distribution of the process. It is\nproved that a Lagrangian-type approximation of the MEP optimization problem,\nreferred to as Lagrangian-MEP problem, is identical to a heuristic\nimplementable algorithm proposed by Baron et al. It is shown that for the right\nchoice of parameters the Lagrangian-MEP algorithm, in addition to having the\nsame asymptotic performance as MEP optimization, is also robust to the\nmeasurement noise. For memoryless sources with a discrete-continuous mixture\ndistribution, the fundamental limits of the minimum number of required\nmeasurements by a non-universal compressed sensing decoder is characterized by\nWu et al. For such sources, it is proved that there is no loss in universal\ncoding, and both the MEP and the Lagrangian-MEP asymptotically achieve the\noptimal performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 16:43:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2015 20:53:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 19:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

However, a\nmeaningful graph is not always readily available from the data, nor easy to\ndefine depending on the application domain. In particular, it is often\ndesirable in graph signal processing applications that a graph is chosen such\nthat the data admit certain regularity or smoothness on the graph. In this\npaper, we address the problem of learning graph Laplacians, which is equivalent\nto learning graph topologies, such that the input data form graph signals with\nsmooth variations on the resulting topology. To this end, we adopt a factor\nanalysis model for the graph signals and impose a Gaussian probabilistic prior\non the latent variables that control these signals.

In\nthe first, the problem is dealt with by distinguishing between the 'classical'\napproach and the 'inverse' regression approach. Both of these models are static\nmodels and are used to estimate exact measurements from measurements that are\naffected by error. In the engineering context, the variables of interest are\nconsidered to be taken at the time at which you observe it. The Bayesian time\nseries analysis method of Dynamic Linear Models (DLM) can be used to monitor\nthe evolution of the measures, thus introducing an dynamic approach to\nstatistical calibration. The research presented employs the use of Bayesian\nmethodology to perform statistical calibration. The DLM's framework is used to\ncapture the time-varying parameters that maybe changing or drifting over time.\nTwo separate DLM based models are presented in this paper. A simulation study\nis conducted where the two models are compared to some well known 'static'\ncalibration approaches in the literature from both the frequentist and Bayesian\nperspectives.

The optimum modes for inference on differential rotation are\nidentified along with the best value of the stellar inclination angle.

In addition, it seems unlikely that\nasteroseismology of Sun-like stars will result in inferences on the radial\nprofile of the differential rotation, such as can be done for, e.g., red\ngiants. At best one could possibly obtain the sign of the radial differential\nrotation gradient. Measurements of the extent of the latitudinal differential\nfrom frequency splitting are, however, more promising.

It describes a\nmechanism through which a quantum Hall effect can appear as an intrinsic\nproperty of a band-structure, rather than being caused by an external magnetic\nfield. Although an implementation in a material was considered unlikely, it has\nprovided the conceptual basis for theoretical and experimental research\nexploring topological insulators and superconductors. Here we report on the\nexperimental realisation of the Haldane model and the characterisation of its\ntopological band-structure, using ultracold fermionic atoms in a periodically\nmodulated optical honeycomb lattice. The model is based on breaking\ntime-reversal symmetry as well as inversion symmetry. The former is achieved\nthrough the introduction of complex next-nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms,\nwhich we induce through circular modulation of the lattice position. For the\nlatter, we create an energy offset between neighbouring sites. Breaking either\nof these symmetries opens a gap in the band-structure, which is probed using\nmomentum-resolved interband transitions. We explore the resulting\nBerry-curvatures of the lowest band by applying a constant force to the atoms\nand find orthogonal drifts analogous to a Hall current. The competition between\nboth broken symmetries gives rise to a transition between topologically\ndistinct regimes. By identifying the vanishing gap at a single Dirac point, we\nmap out this transition line experimentally and quantitatively compare it to\ncalculations using Floquet theory without free parameters. We verify that our\napproach, which allows for dynamically tuning topological properties, is\nsuitable even for interacting fermionic systems.

The first\nmechanism is related to an induced Einstein-Hilbert term on warped brane\nworldvolumes, which leads to a shift in the classical volume of the\ncompactification manifold. The resulting corrections are generic and can appear\nat one-loop order on branes and O-planes of various dimensions and for\nconfigurations with or without intersections.

The\nsimulated galaxies formed most of their stars in many $\\sim$10 Myr long bursts.\nThe CDM galaxy has a global SFH, HI abundance and Fe/H and alpha-elements\ndistribution well matched to current observations of dwarf galaxies. These\nresults highlight the importance of directly including `baryon physics' in\nsimulations when 1) comparing predictions of galaxy formation models with the\nkinematics and number density of local dwarf galaxies and 2) differentiating\nbetween CDM and non-standard models with different DM or power spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 20:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 02:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-23"}

We discuss general thermodynamic properties associated to the\nscale invariance, provide criteria for which the internal energy shift density\nis a bounded function of temperature. We then study the internal energy shift\nand deviations from the energy-pressure proportionality in low dimensional\nmodels of gases interpolating between the ideal Bose and the ideal Fermi gases,\nfocusing on the Lieb-Liniger model in 1d and on the anyonic gas in 2d. In 1d\nthe internal energy shift is determined from the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz\nintegral equations and an explicit relation for it is given at high\ntemperature. Our results show that the internal energy shift is positive, it\nvanishes in the two limits of zero and infinite coupling (respectively the\nideal Bose and the Tonks Girardeau gas) and it has a maximum at a finite,\ntemperature depending, value of the coupling. Remarkably, at fixed coupling the\nenergy shift density saturates to a finite value for infinite temperature. In\n2d we consider systems of Abelian anyons and non Abelian Chern-Simons\nparticles: as it can be seen also directly from a study of the virial\ncoefficients, in the usually considered hard-core limit the internal energy\nshift vanishes and the energy is just proportional to the pressure, with the\nproportionality constant being simply the area of the system.

We then trace the evolution of the enriched gas until\nconditions are met to trigger second-generation star formation. To this extent,\nwe quantify the recovery timescale, which measures the time delay between a\nPop~III SN explosion and the appearance of cold, dense gas, out of which\nsecond-generation stars can form. We find that this timescale is highly\nsensitive to the Pop~III progenitor mass, and less so to the halo environment.\nFor more massive progenitors, including those exploding in pair instability\nSNe, second-generation star formation is delayed significantly, for up to a\nHubble time. The dependence of the recovery time on the mass of the SN\nprogenitor is mainly due to the ionizing impact of the progenitor star.\nPhotoionization heating increases the gas pressure and initiates a\nhydrodynamical response that reduces the central gas density, an effect that is\nstronger in more massive. The gas around lower mass Pop~III stars remains\ndenser and hence the SN remnants cool more rapidly, facilitating the subsequent\nre-condensation of the gas and formation of a second generation of stars.

The\ndevelopment of theoretical models beyond \\Lambda, or smooth dark energy, often\ncalled modified gravity, has led to broader insights into a path forward, and a\nhost of observational and experimental tests have been developed. In this\nreview we present the current state of the field and describe a framework for\nanticipating developments in the next decade. We identify the guiding\nprinciples for rigorous and consistent modifications of the standard model, and\ndiscuss the prospects for empirical tests. We begin by reviewing attempts to\nconsistently modify Einstein gravity in the infrared, focusing on the notion\nthat additional degrees of freedom introduced by the modification must screen\nthemselves from local tests of gravity. We categorize screening mechanisms into\nthree broad classes: mechanisms which become active in regions of high\nNewtonian potential, those in which first derivatives become important, and\nthose for which second derivatives are important. Examples of the first class,\nsuch as f(R) gravity, employ the familiar chameleon or symmetron mechanisms,\nwhereas examples of the last class are galileon and massive gravity theories,\nemploying the Vainshtein mechanism. In each case, we describe the theories as\neffective theories. We describe experimental tests, summarizing laboratory and\nsolar system tests and describing in some detail astrophysical and cosmological\ntests. We discuss future tests which will be sensitive to different signatures\nof new physics in the gravitational sector.

In a BM approach, image frames in a video sequence are divided into\nblocks. For each block in the current frame, the best matching block is\nidentified inside a region of the previous frame, aiming to minimize the sum of\nabsolute differences (SAD). Unfortunately, the SAD evaluation is\ncomputationally expensive and represents the most consuming operation in the BM\nprocess. Therefore, BM motion estimation can be approached as an optimization\nproblem, where the goal is to find the best matching block within a search\nspace. The simplest available BM method is the full search algorithm (FSA)\nwhich finds the most accurate motion vector through an exhaustive computation\nof SAD values for all elements of the search window. Recently, several fast BM\nalgorithms have been proposed to reduce the number of SAD operations by\ncalculating only a fixed subset of search locations at the price of poor\naccuracy. In this paper, a new algorithm based on Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)\noptimization is proposed to reduce the number of search locations in the BM\nprocess. In our algorithm, the computation of search locations is drastically\nreduced by considering a fitness calculation strategy which indicates when it\nis feasible to calculate or only estimate new search locations. Since the\nproposed algorithm does not consider any fixed search pattern or any other\nmovement assumption as most of other BM approaches do, a high probability for\nfinding the true minimum (accurate motion vector) is expected. Conducted\nsimulations show that the proposed method achieves the best balance over other\nfast BM algorithms, in terms of both estimation accuracy and computational\ncost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 21:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

The MLA describes accurately correlated\nelectron states from the weak to the intermediate Coulomb interaction regime in\ninfinite dimensions, and works well even in the strongly correlated region by\nintroducing a new starting wavefunction called the hybrid (HB) wavefunction.\nThe MLA-HB is therefore shown to overcome the limitation of the original local\nansatz (LA) wavefunction as well as the Gutzwiller wavefunction. In particular,\nthe calculated quasiparticle weight vs Coulomb interaction curve is shown to be\nclose to that obtained by the numerical renormalization group approach.

The proposed method combines empirical interpolation\n  techniques and local multiscale methods, such as the Generalized\n  Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM). To solve nonlinear\n  equations, the GMsFEM is used to represent the solution on a coarse\n  grid with multiscale basis functions computed offline. Computing\n  the GMsFEM solution involves calculating the residuals on the fine\n  grid. We use empirical interpolation concepts to evaluate the\n  residuals and the Jacobians of the multiscale system with a\n  computational cost which is proportional to the coarse scale problem\n  rather than the fully-resolved fine scale one. Empirical\n  interpolation methods use basis functions and an inexpensive\n  inversion which are computed in the offline stage for finding the\n  coefficients in the expansion based on a limited number of nonlinear\n  function evaluations. The proposed multiscale empirical\n  interpolation techniques: (1) divide computing the nonlinear\n  function into coarse regions; (2) evaluate contributions of\n  nonlinear functions in each coarse region taking advantage of a\n  reduced-order representation of the solution; and (3) introduce\n  multiscale proper-orthogonal-decomposition techniques to find\n  appropriate interpolation vectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness\n  of the proposed methods on several examples of nonlinear multiscale\n  PDEs that are solved with Newton's methods and fully-implicit time\n  marching schemes.

We formulate a one-dimensional model of\nthe two-component accretion flow consisting of thermal particles and\nhigh-energy particles, supposing that some fraction of the released energy is\nconverted to the acceleration of the high-energy particles. The thermal\ncomponent is governed by fluid dynamics while the high-energy particles obey\nthe moment equations of the diffusion-convection equation. By solving the time\nevolution of these equations, we obtain advection dominated flows as the steady\nstate solutions. Effects of the high-energy particles on the flow structures\nturn out to be small even if the pressure of the high-energy particles\ndominates over the thermal pressure. For a model in which the escaping protons\ntake away almost all the released energy, the high-energy particles have large\ninfluence enough to make the flow have the Keplerian angular velocity at the\ninner region. We calculate the luminosities of the escaping particles for these\nsteady solutions. The escaping particles can extract the energy from about\n$10^{-4}\\dot M c^2$ to $10^{-2}\\dot M c^2$, where $\\dot M$ is the mass\naccretion rates.

The spatial correlation of the quantum interference\npattern in disordered normal state conductors is invariably limited by the\nexponential phase relaxation due to inelastic processes. In this paper we\ndevelop a quantitative theory of the mesoscopic noise in the s-wave\nsuperconducting phase of a strongly disordered superconductor (such that the\nsuperconducting coherence length is much longer than the mean free path).

For masses satisfying a certain\nupper bound, the potential displays a negative minimum and possesses a single\nmassless bound state separated from the Kaluza-Klein (KK) massive modes by a\nmass gap defined by the Hubble (expansion scale) parameter of the 3-brane.

Methods: The properties of the dust are derived from the\nwavelength dependence of the continuum polarization observed in four reddened\nType Ia SN: 1986G, 2006X, 2008fp, and 2014J. [...] Results: All four objects\nare characterized by exceptionally low total-to-selective absorption ratios\n(R_V) and display an anomalous interstellar polarization law, characterized by\nvery blue polarization peaks. In all cases the polarization position angle is\nwell aligned with the local spiral structure. While SN~1986G is compatible with\nthe most extreme cases of interstellar polarization known in the Galaxy,\nSN2006X, 2008fp, and 2014J show unprecedented behaviours. The observed\ndeviations do not appear to be connected to selection effects related to the\nrelatively large amounts of reddening characterizing the objects in the sample.\nConclusions: The dust responsible for the polarization of these four SN is most\nlikely of interstellar nature. The polarization properties can be interpreted\nin terms of a significantly enhanced abundance of small grains. The anomalous\nbehaviour is apparently associated with the properties of the galactic\nenvironment in which the SN explode, rather than with the progenitor system\nfrom which they originate. For the extreme case of SN2014J, we cannot exclude\nthe contribution of light scattered by local material; however, the observed\npolarization properties require an ad hoc geometrical dust distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 08:25:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 15:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The equilibrium properties\nof the thermodynamic state of interest (e.g., lowest temperature or unbiased\npotential) can be computed using reweighting estimators such as the weighted\nhistogram analysis method or the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR).\nweighted histogram analysis method and MBAR produce unbiased estimates, the\nsimulation samples from the global equilibria at their respective thermodynamic\nstate--a requirement that can be prohibitively expensive for some simulations\nsuch as a large parallel tempering ensemble of an explicitly solvated\nbiomolecule.

The interplay between the code rate, the\nundetected and total error probabilities is characterized. Using the\ninformation spectrum method, a sequence of codes of increasing blocklengths $n$\nis designed to illustrate this tradeoff. Furthermore, for additive discrete\nmemoryless channels with uniform input distribution, we establish that our\nanalysis is tight with respect to the ensemble average. This is done by\nanalysing the ensemble performance in terms of a tradeoff between the code\nrate, the undetected and the total errors. This tradeoff is parametrized by the\nthreshold in a generalized likelihood ratio test. Two asymptotic regimes are\nstudied. First, the code rate tends to the capacity of the channel at a rate\nslower than $n^{-1/2}$ corresponding to the moderate deviations regime.

More generally, the lack of longitudinal, cross-sectional data\ndemonstrating the evolution of spatial interactions at a meaningful urban scale\nalso hinders us from evaluating the sensitivity of movement indicators,\nlimiting our capacity to understand the evolution of urban mobility in depth.\nUsing very large mobility records distributed over three years we quantify the\nimpact of the completion of a metro line extension: the circle line (CCL) in\nSingapore.

However, one of its main features is a wavelength variation across\nthe field of view, sometimes termed the phase effect. In this work, an\nanomalous phase effect is reported and characterized for the OSIRIS instrument\nat the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias. The transmitted wavelength across the\nfield of view of the instrument depends, not only on the distance to the\noptical centre, but on wavelength. This effect is calibrated for the red\ntunable filter of OSIRIS by measuring both normal-incidence light at laboratory\nand spectral lamps at the telescope at non-normal incidence.\n  This effect can be explained by taking into account the inner coatings of the\netalon. In a high spectral resolution etalon, the gap between plates is much\nlarger than the thickness of the inner reflective coatings. In the case of a\ntunable filter, like that in OSIRIS, the coatings thickness could be of the\norder of the cavity, which changes drastically the effective gap of the etalon.\nWe show that by including thick and dispersive coatings into the interference\nequations, the observed anomalous phase effect can be perfectly reproduced. In\nfact, we find that, for the OSIRIS red TF, a two-coatings model fits the data\nwith a rms of 0.5\\AA\\ at all wavelengths and incidence angles.

The proper motion analysis of individual jet\ncomponents allows us to constrain jet formation and propagation and to test the\nproposed correlation of increased high energy flux with jet ejection events.\nCen A is an exceptional laboratory for such detailed study as its proximity\ntranslates to unrivaled linear resolution, where 1 mas corresponds to 0.018 pc.\nThe first 7 epochs of high-resolution TANAMI VLBI observations at 8 GHz of Cen\nA are presented, resolving the jet on (sub-)mas scales.

For\nmany MSPs the scattering delay above 1 GHz is at the limit of detectability;\ntherefore, we study it at lower frequencies. Using the LOFAR (LOw-Frequency\nARray) radio telescope we have analyzed short (5-20 min) observations of three\nMSPs in order to estimate the scattering delay at 110-190 MHz, where the number\nof scintles is large and, hence, the statistical uncertainty in the scattering\ndelay is small. We used cyclic spectroscopy, still relatively novel in radio\nastronomy, on baseband-sampled data to achieve unprecedented frequency\nresolution while retaining adequate pulse phase resolution. We detected\nscintillation structure in the spectra of the MSPs PSR B1257+12, PSR\nJ1810+1744, and PSR J2317+1439 with diffractive bandwidths of $6\\pm 3$, $2.0\\pm\n0.3$, and $\\sim 7$ kHz, respectively, where the estimate for PSR J2317+1439 is\nreliable to about a factor of 2.

These two\nphysical quantities suffer from a well-known bias in the presence of\nmeasurement noise, as has been described in part I of this series. In this\npaper, part II of the series, we explore the extent to which various estimators\nmay correct the bias. Traditional frequentist estimators of the polarization\nfraction are compared with two recent estimators: one inspired by a Bayesian\nanalysis and a second following an asymptotic method. We investigate the\nsensitivity of these estimators to the asymmetry of the covariance matrix which\nmay vary over large datasets. We present for the first time a comparison among\npolarization angle estimators, and evaluate the statistical bias on the angle\nthat appears when the covariance matrix exhibits effective ellipticity. We also\naddress the question of the accuracy of the polarization fraction and angle\nuncertainty estimators. The methods linked to the credible intervals and to the\nvariance estimates are tested against the robust confidence interval method.\nFrom this pool of estimators, we build recipes adapted to different use-cases:\nbuild a mask, compute large maps, and deal with low S/N data. More generally,\nwe show that the traditional estimators suffer from discontinuous distributions\nat low S/N, while the asymptotic and Bayesian methods do not. Attention is\ngiven to the shape of the output distribution of the estimators, and is\ncompared with a Gaussian. In this regard, the new asymptotic method presents\nthe best performance, while the Bayesian output distribution is shown to be\nstrongly asymmetric with a sharp cut at low S/N.Finally, we present an\noptimization of the estimator derived from the Bayesian analysis using adapted\npriors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 10:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-11"}

At this level of precision, several noise sources that until now\nhave been outweighed by photon noise will start to contribute significantly to\nthe error budget. The telluric lines that are not neglected by the masks for\nthe radial velocity computation, here called micro-telluric lines, are one such\nnoise source. Aims: In this work we investigate the impact of micro-telluric\nlines in the radial velocities calculations. We also investigate how to correct\nthe effect of these atmospheric lines on radial velocities. Methods: The work\npresented here follows two parallel lines. First, we calculated the impact of\nthe micro-telluric lines by multiplying a synthetic solar-like stellar spectrum\nby synthetic atmospheric spectra and evaluated the effect created by the\npresence of the telluric lines. Then, we divided HARPS spectra by synthetic\natmospheric spectra to correct for its presence on real data and calculated the\nradial velocity on the corrected spectra. When doing so, one considers two\natmospheric models for the synthetic atmospheric spectra: the LBLRTM and TAPAS.\nResults: We find that the micro-telluric lines can induce an impact on the\nradial velocities calculation that can already be close to the current\nprecision achieved with HARPS, and so its effect should not be neglected,\nespecially for future instruments such as ESPRESSO. Moreover, we find that the\nmicro-telluric lines' impact depends on factors, such as the radial velocity of\nthe star, airmass, relative humidity, and the barycentric Earth radial velocity\nprojected along the line of sight at the time of the observation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 10:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

However, since they are efficiently scattered by the galactic\nmagnetic fields, many questions remain open, such as where exactly they are\naccelerated, what is their original energy spectrum, and how they propagate\ninto molecular clouds. In this work we present new observations and discuss in\ndetail a method that allows us to measure the cosmic ray ionisation rate\ntowards the molecular clouds close to the W28 supernova remnant. To perform\nthese measurements, we use CO, HCO$^+$, and DCO$^+$ millimetre line\nobservations and compare them with the predictions of radiative transfer and\nchemical models away from thermodynamical equilibrium. The CO observations\nallow us to constrain the density, temperature, and column density towards each\nobserved position, while the DCO$^+$/HCO$^+$ abundance ratios provide us with\nconstraints on the electron fraction and, consequently, on the cosmic ray\nionisation rate. Towards positions located close to the supernova remnant, we\nfind cosmic ray ionisation rates much larger ($\\gtrsim100$) than those in\nstandard galactic clouds. Conversely, towards one position situated at a larger\ndistance, we derive a standard cosmic ray ionisation rate. Overall, these\nobservations support the hypothesis that the $\\gamma$ rays observed in the\nregion have a hadronic origin. In addition, based on CR diffusion estimates, we\nfind that the ionisation of the gas is likely due to $0.1 -1$ GeV cosmic rays.\nFinally, these observations are also in agreement with the global picture of\ncosmic ray diffusion, in which the low-energy tail of the cosmic ray population\ndiffuses at smaller distances than the high-energy counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 11:53:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 14:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

Gene translation includes several steps. During the\nelongation step, ribosomes move along the mRNA in a sequential manner and link\namino-acids together in the corresponding order to produce the proteins.\n  The homogeneous ribosome flow model(HRFM) is a deterministic computational\nmodel for translation-elongation under the assumption of constant elongation\nrates along the mRNA chain. The HRFM is described by a set of n first-order\nnonlinear ordinary differential equations, where n represents the number of\nsites along the mRNA chain. The HRFM also includes two positive parameters:\nribosomal initiation rate and the (constant) elongation rate. In this paper, we\nshow that the steady-state translation rate in the HRFM is a concave function\nof its parameters. This means that the problem of determining the parameter\nvalues that maximize the translation rate is relatively simple. Our results may\ncontribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms and evolution of\ntranslation-elongation. We demonstrate this by using the theoretical results to\nestimate the initiation rate in M. musculus embryonic stem cell. The underlying\nassumption is that evolution optimized the translation mechanism.\n  For the infinite-dimensional HRFM, we derive a closed-form solution to the\nproblem of determining the initiation and transition rates that maximize the\nprotein translation rate. We show that these expressions provide good\napproximations for the optimal values in the n-dimensional HRFM already for\nrelatively small values of n. These results may have applications for synthetic\nbiology where an important problem is to re-engineer genomic systems in order\nto maximize the protein production rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 12:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

The computational burden required is often prohibitive in practice.\nRebeschini and Van Handel (2013) analyse a new approach for particle filtering\nin large-scale dynamic random fields.

In this paper, we study the cases ${\\sf\nQ}_n=\\Pi_n^{(r)}$ and ${\\sf Q}_n={\\sf Q}_n^{(r)}$ where $\\Pi_n^{(r)}$ and ${\\sf\nQ}_n^{(r)}$ are posets, respectively, of set partitions of $[rn]$ whose block\nsizes are divisible by $r$ and of $r$-partitions of $[n]$. In both cases we\nprove that $r_n(\\Pi_n^{(r)})$ and $r_n({\\sf Q}_n^{(r)})$ enumerate the pyramids\nby applying the Cartier-Foata monoid identity and further prove that\n$r_n(\\Pi_n^{(r)})$ is the generalized Euler number $E_{rn-1}$ and that\n$r_n({\\sf Q}_n^{(2)})$ is the number of complete non-ambiguous trees of size\n$2n-1$ by bijections. This gives a new proof of Welker's theorem that\n$r_n(\\Pi_n^{(r)})=E_{rn-1}$ and implies the construction of $r$-dimensional\ncomplete non-ambiguous trees. As a bonus of applying the theory of heaps, we\nestablish a bijection between the set of complete non-ambiguous forests and the\nset of pairs of permutations with no common rise.

Whether the C\nflame will actually be able to reach the centre depends on the efficiency of\nextra mixing beneath the C convective shell. Whereas thermohaline mixing is too\ninefficient to interfere with the C-flame propagation, convective boundary\nmixing can prevent the C burning from reaching the centre. As a result, a\nC-O-Ne white dwarf (WD) is formed, after the star has lost its envelope. Such a\n\"hybrid\" WD has a small CO core surrounded by a thick ONe zone. In our 1D\nstellar evolution computations, the hybrid WD is allowed to accrete C-rich\nmaterial, as if it were in a close binary system and accreted H-rich material\nfrom its companion with a sufficiently high rate at which the accreted H would\nbe processed into He under stationary conditions, assuming that He could then\nbe transformed into C. When the mass of the accreting WD approaches the\nChandrasekhar limit, we find a series of convective Urca shell flashes\nassociated with high abundances of 23Na and 25Mg. They are followed by\noff-centre C ignition leading to convection that occupies almost the entire\nstar. To model the Urca processes, we use the most recent well-resolved data\nfor their reaction and neutrino-energy loss rates. Because of the emphasized\nuncertainty of the convective Urca process in our hybrid WD models of SN Ia\nprogenitors, we consider a number of their potentially possible alternative\ninstances for different mixing assumptions, all of which reach a phase of\nexplosive C ignition, either off or in the centre. Our hybrid SN Ia progenitor\nmodels have much lower C to O abundance ratios at the moment of the explosive C\nignition than their pure CO counterparts, which may explain the observed\ndiversity of the SNe Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 14:16:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 19:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The system harbours four planetary-mass companions detected by direct\nimaging, and is a good solar system analogue. The masses of the companions are\nnot known accurately, because the estimation depends strongly on the age of the\nsystem, which is also not known with sufficient accuracy. Asteroseismic studies\nof the star might help to better constrain the age of HR 8799. We organized an\nextensive photometric and multi-site spectroscopic observing campaign for\nstudying the pulsations of the central star.\n  Aims: The aim of the present study is to investigate the pulsation properties\nof HR 8799 in detail via the ultra-precise 47-d-long nearly continuous\nphotometry obtained with the MOST space telescope, and to find as many\nindependent pulsation modes as possible, which is the prerequisite of an\nasteroseismic age determination.\n  Methods: We carried out Fourier analysis of the wide-band photometric time\nseries.\n  Results: We find that resonance and sudden amplitude changes characterize the\npulsation of HR 8799. The dominant frequency is always at f1 = 1.978 c/d. Many\nmultiples of one ninth of the dominant frequency appear in the Fourier spectrum\nof the MOST data: n/9 f1, where n={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17,\n18}. Our analysis also reveals that many of these peaks show strong amplitude\ndecrease and phase variations even on the 47-d time-scale. The dependencies\nbetween the pulsation frequencies of HR 8799 make the planned subsequent\nasteroseismic analysis rather difficult. We point out some resemblance between\nthe light curve of HR 8799 and the modulated pulsation light curves of Blazhko\nRR Lyrae stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 14:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

The NCI is due to the unphysical\ncoupling of electromagnetic waves on a grid to wave-particle resonances,\nincluding aliased resonances, i.e., $\\omega + 2\\pi\\mu/\\Delta t=(k_1+\n2\\pi\\nu_1/\\Delta x_1)v_0$, where $\\mu$ and $\\nu_1$ refer to the time and space\naliases and the plasma is drifting relativistically at velocity $v_0$ in the\n$\\hat{1}$-direction. Recent studies have shown that an EM-PIC code which uses a\nspectral field solver and a low pass filter can eliminate the fastest growing\nmodes of the NCI. Based on these studies a new spectral PIC code for studying\nlaser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in the Lorentz boosted frame was developed.\nHowever, we show that for parameters of relevance for LWFA simulations in the\nboosted frame, a relativistically drifting plasma is susceptible to a host of\nadditional unstable modes with lower growth rates, and that these modes appear\nwhen the fastest growing unstable modes are filtered out. We show that these\nmodes are most easily identified as the coupling between modes which are purely\ntransverse (EM) and purely longitudinal (Langmuir) in the rest frame of the\nplasma for specific time and space aliases. We rewrite the dispersion relation\nof the drifting plasma for a general field solver and obtain analytic\nexpressions for the location and growth rate for each unstable mode, i.e, for\neach time and space aliased resonances. We show for the spectral solver that\nwhen the fastest growing mode is eliminated a new mode at the fundamental\nresonance ($\\mu=\\nu_1=0$) can be seen.

In order to derive precise mathematical results, we use a simple\nhaploid, asexual model. In general, we show that eusocial reproductive\nstrategies are unlikely to materialize unless large fitness advantages are\ngained by the production of only a few workers. These fitness advantages are\nmaximized through obligate rather than facultative eusocial strategies.\nFurthermore, we find that solitary reproduction is `unbeatable' as long as the\nsolitary reproductive ratio exceeds a critical value. In these cases, no\neusocial parameters exist that would reduce their probability of extinction.\nOur results help to explain why the number of solitary species exceeds that of\neusocial ones: eusociality is a high risk, high reward strategy, while solitary\nreproduction is better at risk management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 15:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

We introduce a model of\ngames of this kind, where agents first trade in a prediction market and then\ntake an action that influences the market outcome. Our two-stage two-player\nmodel, despite its simplicity, captures two aspects of real-world prediction\nmarkets: (1) agents may directly influence the outcome, (2) some of the agents\ninstrumental in deciding the outcome may not take part in the prediction\nmarket. We show that this game has two different types of perfect Bayesian\nequilibria, which we term LPP and HPP, depending on the values of the belief\nparameters: in the LPP domain, equilibrium prices reveal expected market\noutcomes conditional on the participants' private information, whereas HPP\nequilibria are collusive -- participants effectively coordinate in an\nuninformative and untruthful way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Jul 2014 04:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-28"}
