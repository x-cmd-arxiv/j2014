We aim to search for VHE gamma-ray emission from AE\nAqr during different states of the source at several wavelengths to confirm or\nrule out previous claims of detection of gamma-ray emission from this object.\nWe report on observations of AE Aqr performed by MAGIC. The source was observed\nduring 12 hours as part of a multiwavelength campaign carried out between May\nand June 2012 covering the optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray ranges. Besides MAGIC,\nthe other facilities involved were the KVA, Skinakas, and Vidojevica telescopes\nin the optical and Swift in X-rays. We calculated integral upper limits\ncoincident with different states of the source in the optical. We computed\nupper limits to the pulsed emission limiting the signal region to 30% of the\nphaseogram and we also searched for pulsed emission at different frequencies\napplying the Rayleigh test. AE Aqr was not detected at VHE energies during the\nmultiwavelength campaign. We establish integral upper limits at the 95\\%\nconfidence level for the steady emission assuming the differential flux\nproportional to a power-law function d\\phi/dE \\propto E^{-Gamma}, with a\nCrab-like photon spectral index of Gamma=2.6. The upper limit above 200 GeV is\n6.4\\times10^{-12} cm^{-2}s^{-1} and above 1 TeV is 7.4\\times10^{-13}\ncm^{-2}s^{-1}. We obtained an upper limit for the pulsed emission of\n2.6\\times10^{-12} cm^{-2}s^{-1} for energies above 200 GeV. Applying the\nRayleigh test for pulsed emission at different frequencies we did not find any\nsignificant signal. Our results indicate that AE Aqr is not a VHE gamma-ray\nemitter at the level of emission previously claimed. We have established the\nmost constraining upper limits for the VHE gamma-ray emission of AE Aqr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 16:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

From these expressions we predict the behavior of the\nCramer-Rao astrometric and photometric precision as a function of the signal\nand the noise of the observations, and compare them to actual observations -\nfinding a good correspondence between them.\n  We show that the astrometric Cramer-Rao bound goes as $(S/N)^{-1}$ (similar\nto the photometric bound) but, additionally, we find that this bound is quite\nsensitive to the value of the background - suppressing the background can\ngreatly enhance the astrometric accuracy.\n  We present a systematic analysis of the elements of the Fisher matrix in the\ncase when the detector adequately samples the source (oversampling regime),\nleading to closed-form analytical expressions for the Cramer-Rao bound.

In [23], by extending previous ideas of Shannon [38], [39], Khinchin\nproposed an axiomatic definition of the BG entropy, based on four requirements,\nnowadays known as the Shannon-Khinchin (SK) axioms.\n  The purpose of this paper is twofold.

Opacity\nregrouping has previously been applied to IMC-DDMC calculations for problems in\nwhich the dependence of the opacity on frequency is monotonic. We generalize\nopacity regrouping to non-contiguous groups and implement this in \\supernu, a\ncode designed to do radiation transport in high-velocity outflows with\nnon-monotonic opacities.

Recent work has\nshown that compress-and-forward based strategies can achieve the capacity of\nthis network within an additive gap. Here, the relays quantize their received\nsignals at the noise level and map them to random Gaussian codebooks. The\nresultant gap to capacity is independent of the SNRs of the channels in the\nnetwork and the topology but is linear in the total number of nodes.\n  In this paper, we provide an improved lower bound on the rate achieved by\ncompress-and-forward based strategies (noisy network coding in particular) in\narbitrary Gaussian relay networks, whose gap to capacity depends on the network\nnot only through the total number of nodes but also through the degrees of\nfreedom of the min cut of the network. We illustrate that for many networks,\nthis refined lower bound can lead to a better approximation of the capacity. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that it leads to a logarithmic rather than linear\ncapacity gap in the total number of nodes for certain classes of layered\nnetworks. The improvement comes from quantizing the received signals of the\nrelays at a resolution decreasing with the total number of nodes in the\nnetwork. This suggests that the rule-of-thumb in literature of quantizing the\nreceived signals at the noise level can be highly suboptimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 22:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 04:55:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2015 17:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-16"}

Specifically, the layer SLNR scheme incorporates the\nMIMO receiver structure into the precoder design procedure, which makes the\nformulation of signal power and interference / leakage power more accurate.\nBesides, the layer SLNR scheme not only takes into account the inter-layer\ninterference from different users, but also takes care of the inter-layer\ninterference from the same user which is usually assumed to be zero in previous\nstudies. As a result, the proposed layer SLNR scheme produces a good balance\nbetween the layer signal power and layer interference power in a multi-user\nmulti-layer MIMO system, therefore achieves better system performance. The\neffectiveness and superiority of the proposed layer SLNR scheme are validated\nvia simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 02:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-16"}

The distribution of the total\nuncertainty is considered as two normal distributions, statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties. The standard deviation of the statistical part,\n{\\sigma}stat, is estimated through random parameters distributed around their\nbest fitted values. The two normal distributions are obtained by minimizing the\nmoments of the distribution of the residues with the fixed {\\sigma}stat. The\nmethod is applied to the liquid drop model (LD).

A variable primary continuum dominates the high energy\nspectrum (>10 keV) in all the states, while the reflected/scattered flux which\ndominates at E< 10 keV stays approximately constant. From modelling the complex\nreflection/transmission spectrum we derive a Compton depth along the line of\nsight of tau_Thomson ~ 2.9, and a global covering factor for the circumnuclear\ngas of ~ 0.15. This agrees with the constraints derived from the high energy\nvariability, which implies that most of the high energy flux is transmitted,\nrather that Compton-scattered. This demonstrates the effectiveness of spectral\nanalysis in constraining the geometric properties of the circumnuclear gas, and\nvalidates similar methods used for analyzing the spectra of other bright,\nCompton-thick AGN.

Different typologies\nof WFAO have been studied over the past years. They all require multiple GSs to\nperform a tomographic analysis of the atmospheric turbulence.

One way to\nget to this information is to use the telemetry data provided by the WFAO\nsystem itself. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that WFAO systems allows one to\nderive the Cn2 and wind profile in the main turbulence layers (see e.g. Cortes\net al. 2012).

The strengths of total\nmagnetic field are within 5-9 \\mu G, while the ordered fields reach 1-2 \\mu G.\nThe magnetic field strengths are well correlated with the surface density of\nSFR and manifest a power-law relation with an exponent of 0.25 extending a\nsimilar relation found for dwarf galaxies. The production of magnetic energy\nper supernova event is similar for all the various galaxies. It constitutes\nabout 3% of the individual SN energy release. We show that the total magnetic\nfield energy in galaxies is almost linearly related to the galactic gas mass,\nwhich indicates equipartition of the magnetic energy and the turbulent kinetic\nenergy of the ISM. The Magellanic-type galaxies fit very well with the\nradio-infrared relation constructed for surface brightness of galaxies of\nvarious types, including bright spirals and interacting objects. We found that\nthe typical far-infrared relation based on luminosity of galaxies is tighter\nand steeper but more likely to inherit a partial correlation from a tendency\nthat larger objects are also more luminous. The thermal fractions, radio\nspectral indices, and magnetic field strengths of the Magellanic-type galaxies\nare between the values determined for spirals and dwarf galaxies. The confirmed\nmagnetic field-star formation and radio-infrared relations for low-mass\ngalaxies point to similar physical processes that must be at work in all\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 13:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

The physical properties of Beta Pic b were previously\ninferred from broad and narrow-band 0.9-4.8 microns photometry. We used\ncommissioning data of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) to obtain new astrometry\nand a low-resolution (R=35-39) J-band (1.12-1.35 microns) spectrum of the\nplanet. We find that the planet has passed the quadrature. We constrain its\nsemi-major axis to $\\leq$ 10 AU (90 % prob.) with a peak at 8.9+0.4-0.6 AU. The\njoint fit of the planet astrometry and the most recent radial velocity\nmeasurements of the star yields a planet's dynamical mass $\\leq$ 20 MJup\n(greater than 96 % prob.). The extracted spectrum of Beta Pic b is similar to\nthose of young L1-1.5+1 dwarfs. We use the spectral type estimate to revise the\nplanet luminosity to log(L/Lsun)=-3.90+-0.07. The 0.9-4.8 microns photometry\nand spectrum are reproduced for Teff=1650+-150 K and a log g lower than 4.7 dex\nby 12 grids of PHOENIX-based and LESIA atmospheric models. If we adopt the most\nrecent system age estimate (21+-4 Myr), the bolometric luminosity and the\nconstraints on the dynamical mass of Beta Pic b are only reproduced by warm-\nand hot-start tracks with initial entropies Si greater than 10.5 kB/baryon.\nSuch initial conditions may result from an inefficient accretion shock and/or a\nplanetesimal density at formation higher than in the classical core accretion\nmodel. Considering a younger age for the system or a conservative formation\ntime for Beta Pic b does not change these conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 14:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

In this paper, 10000\nsamples of reliable (convergent), multiple-scale (from 1.0E-60 to 100)\nnumerical simulations of a chaotic three-body system indicate that, without any\nexternal disturbance, the microscopic inherent uncertainty (in the level of\n1.0E-60) due to physical fluctuation of initial positions of the three-body\nsystem enlarges exponentially into macroscopic randomness (at the level O(1))\nuntil t=T*, the so-called physical limit time of prediction, but propagates\nalgebraically thereafter when accurate prediction of orbit is impossible. Note\nthat these 10000 samples use micro-level, inherent physical fluctuations of\ninitial position, which have nothing to do with human being. Especially, the\ndifferences of these 10000 fluctuations are mathematically so small (in the\nlevel of 1.0E-60) that they are physically the SAME since a distance shorter\nthan a Planck length does not make physical senses according to the spring\ntheory.

To solve this bottleneck, we\nborrow the concept of channel features to the face detection domain, which\nextends the image channel to diverse types like gradient magnitude and oriented\ngradient histograms and therefore encodes rich information in a simple form. We\nadopt a novel variant called aggregate channel features, make a full\nexploration of feature design, and discover a multi-scale version of features\nwith better performance. To deal with poses of faces in the wild, we propose a\nmulti-view detection approach featuring score re-ranking and detection\nadjustment.

For more than 100 000 stars in common with the Hipparcos\nCatalogue it will be possible to compute very accurate proper motions due to\nthe time difference of about 24 years between the two missions. This Hundred\nThousand Proper Motions (HTPM) project will be part of the first release. Our\naim is to investigate how early Gaia data can be optimally combined with\ninformation from the Hipparcos Catalogue in order to provide the most accurate\nand reliable results for HTPM. The Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS)\nwas developed to compute the astrometric core solution based on the Gaia\nobservations and will be used for all releases of astrometric data from Gaia.\nWe adapt AGIS to process Hipparcos data in addition to Gaia observations, and\nuse simulations to verify and study the joint solution method. For the HTPM\nstars we predict proper motion accuracies between 14 and 134 muas/yr, depending\non stellar magnitude and amount of Gaia data available. Perspective effects\nwill be important for a significant number of HTPM stars, and in order to treat\nthese effects accurately we introduce a scaled model of kinematics. We define a\ngoodness-of-fit statistic which is sensitive to deviations from uniform space\nmotion, caused for example by binaries with periods of 10-50 years. HTPM will\nsignificantly improve the proper motions of the Hipparcos Catalogue well before\nhighly accurate Gaia- only results become available. Also, HTPM will allow us\nto detect long period binary and exoplanetary candidates which would be\nimpossible to detect from Gaia data alone. The full sensitivity will not be\nreached with the first Gaia release but with subsequent data releases.\nTherefore HTPM should be repeated when more Gaia data become available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 15:39:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 16:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

Furthermore, simulations are often single-threaded, and\nuser interfaces are non-trivial to use. Therefore there are significant hurdles\nto conducting efficient and collaborative chemical research. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new enterprise chemistry simulation framework, COEL, which\naddresses these issues. COEL is the first web-based framework of its kind. A\nvisually pleasing and intuitive user interface, simulations that run on a large\ncomputational grid, reliable database storage, and transactional services make\nCOEL ideal for collaborative research and education. COEL's most prominent\nfeatures include ODE-based simulations of chemical reaction networks and\nmulticompartment reaction networks, with rich options for user interactions\nwith those networks. COEL provides DNA-strand displacement transformations and\nvisualization (and is to our knowledge the first CRN framework to do so), GA\noptimization of rate constants, expression validation, an application-wide\nplotting engine, and SBML/Octave/Matlab export. We also present an overview of\nthe underlying software and technologies employed and describe the main\narchitectural decisions driving our development.

A workflow is created from\nuser-written Python functions (nodes) connected by 'pipes' (edges) into a\ndirected acyclic graph. These functions are arbitrarily definable, and can make\nuse of any Python modules or external binaries. Given a user-defined topology\nand collection of input data, functions are composed into nested higher-order\nmaps, which are transparently and robustly evaluated in parallel on a single\ncomputer or on remote hosts. Local and remote computational resources can be\nflexibly pooled and assigned to functional nodes, thereby allowing facile\nload-balancing and pipeline optimization to maximize computational throughput.\nInput items are processed by nodes in parallel, and traverse the graph in\nbatches of adjustable size -- a trade-off between lazy-evaluation, parallelism,\nand memory consumption. The processing of a single item can be parallelized in\na scatter/gather scheme. The simplicity and flexibility of distributed\nworkflows using PaPy bridges the gap between desktop -> grid, enabling this new\ncomputing paradigm to be leveraged in the processing of large scientific\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Jul 2014 03:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-17"}

In social networks, for example, links\ntend to exist between individuals of similar age, nationality, location, race,\nincome, educational level, religious belief, and language. Thus, various\nattributes jointly affect the network topology. An interesting problem is to\ndetect community structure beyond some specific assortativity-related\nattributes $\\rho$, i.e., to take out the effect of $\\rho$ on network topology\nand reveal the hidden community structure which are due to other attributes. An\napproach to this problem is to redefine the null model of the modularity\nmeasure, so as to simulate the effect of $\\rho$ on network topology. However, a\nchallenge is that we do not know to what extent the network topology is\naffected by $\\rho$ and by other attributes.
