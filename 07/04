However, two basic and ubiquitous\nproperties of cortical responses seem difficult to reconcile with probabilistic\ninference: neural activity displays prominent oscillations in response to\nconstant input, and large transient changes in response to stimulus onset. Here\nwe show that these dynamical behaviours may in fact be understood as hallmarks\nof the specific representation and algorithm that the cortex employs to perform\nprobabilistic inference. We demonstrate that a particular family of\nprobabilistic inference algorithms, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), naturally\nmaps onto the dynamics of excitatory-inhibitory neural networks. Specifically,\nwe constructed a model of an excitatory-inhibitory circuit in primary visual\ncortex that performed HMC inference, and thus inherently gave rise to\noscillations and transients. These oscillations were not mere epiphenomena but\nserved an important functional role: speeding up inference by rapidly spanning\na large volume of state space. Inference thus became an order of magnitude more\nefficient than in a non-oscillatory variant of the model. In addition, the\nnetwork matched two specific properties of observed neural dynamics that would\notherwise be difficult to account for in the context of probabilistic\ninference. First, the frequency of oscillations as well as the magnitude of\ntransients increased with the contrast of the image stimulus. Second,\nexcitation and inhibition were balanced, and inhibition lagged excitation.\nThese results suggest a new functional role for the separation of cortical\npopulations into excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and for the neural\noscillations that emerge in such excitatory-inhibitory networks: enhancing the\nefficiency of cortical computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 16:13:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2014 06:57:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2016 15:44:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-03"}

We solve the hydromagnetic equations\nnumerically in a rotating spherical shell for a set of different radiative\nconductivities controlling the relative importance of convection.

How can group behaviors such as\ncollective action, or decision making that accounts for memories of past\nexperience, emerge and persist? Evolutionary game theory provides a framework\nfor formalizing these questions and admitting them to rigorous study. Here we\ndevelop such a framework to study the evolution of sustained collective action\nin multi-player public-goods games, in which players have arbitrarily long\nmemories of prior rounds of play and can react to their experience in an\narbitrary way. To study this problem we construct a coordinate system for\nmemory-$m$ strategies in iterated $n$-player games that permits us to\ncharacterize all the cooperative strategies that resist invasion by any mutant\nstrategy, and thus stabilize cooperative behavior. We show that while larger\ngames inevitably make cooperation harder to evolve, there nevertheless always\nexists a positive volume of strategies that stabilize cooperation provided the\npopulation size is large enough. We also show that, when games are small,\nlonger-memory strategies make cooperation easier to evolve, by increasing the\nnumber of ways to stabilize cooperation. Finally we explore the co-evolution of\nbehavior and memory capacity, and we find that longer-memory strategies tend to\nevolve in small games, which in turn drives the evolution of cooperation even\nwhen the benefits for cooperation are low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 19:25:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 22:57:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 23:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

The PDFs of events are first ranked by decreasing location\nerrors and then successively condensed onto better located and lower variance\nevent PDFs. The obtained condensed catalog attributes different weights to each\nevent, providing an optimal spatial representation with respect to the\nspatially varying location capability of the seismic network.

We re-observed CoRoT-7 in January 2012 with both HARPS and CoRoT, so\nthat we now have the benefit of simultaneous radial-velocity and photometric\ndata. This allows us to use the off-transit variations in the star's light\ncurve to estimate the radial-velocity variations induced by the suppression of\nconvective blueshift and the flux blocked by starspots. To account for\nactivity-related effects in the radial-velocities which do not have a\nphotometric signature, we also include an additional activity term in the\nradial-velocity model, which we treat as a Gaussian process with the same\ncovariance properties (and hence the same frequency structure) as the light\ncurve. Our model was incorporated into a Monte Carlo Markov Chain in order to\nmake a precise determination of the orbits of CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-7c. We measure\nthe masses of planets b and c to be 4.73 +/- 0.95 Mearth and 13.56 +/- 1.08\nMearth, respectively. The density of CoRoT-7b is (6.61 +/- 1.72)(Rp/1.58\nRearth)^(-3) g.cm^(-3), which is compatible with a rocky composition. We search\nfor evidence of an additional planet d, identified by previous authors with a\nperiod close to 9 days. We are not able to confirm the existence of a planet\nwith this orbital period, which is close to the second harmonic of the stellar\nrotation at around 7.9 days. Using Bayesian model selection we find that a\nmodel with two planets plus activity-induced variations is most favoured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The majority\nof our galaxies have a metallicity gradient consistent with being flat or\nnegative (i.e. higher metallicity cores than outskirts). Intriguingly, we find\na trend between metallicity gradient and specific star formation rate (sSFR),\nsuch that galaxies with a high sSFR tend to have relatively metal-poor centres,\na result which is strengthened when combined with datasets from the literature.\nThis result appears to explain the discrepancies reported between different\nhigh redshift studies and varying claims for evolution. From a galaxy evolution\nperspective, the trend we see would mean that a galaxy's sSFR is governed by\nthe amount of metal poor gas that can be funnelled into its core, triggered\neither by merging or through efficient accretion. In fact merging may play a\nsignificant role as it is the starburst galaxies at all epochs, which have the\nmore positive metallicity gradients. Our results may help to explain the origin\nof the fundamental metallicity relation, in which galaxies at a fixed mass are\nobserved to have lower metallicities at higher star formation rates, especially\nif the metallicity is measured in an aperture encompassing only the central\nregions of the galaxy.

Throughout this paper we also provide\nand test a framework for balancing the physical discretization error with the\nstochastic interpolation error of the enhanced sparse grid approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 21:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Triangles can have\nimportant interpretations in real-world graphs, especially social and other\ninteraction networks. Despite the lack of provably efficient (linear, or\nslightly super-linear) worst-case algorithms for this problem, practitioners\nrun simple, efficient heuristics to find all triangles in graphs with millions\nof vertices. How are these heuristics exploiting the structure of these special\ngraphs to provide major speedups in running time?\n  We study one of the most prevalent algorithms used by practitioners. A\ntrivial algorithm enumerates all paths of length $2$, and checks if each such\npath is incident to a triangle. A good heuristic is to enumerate only those\npaths of length $2$ where the middle vertex has the lowest degree. It is easily\nimplemented and is empirically known to give remarkable speedups over the\ntrivial algorithm.\n  We study the behavior of this algorithm over graphs with heavy-tailed degree\ndistributions, a defining feature of real-world graphs. The erased\nconfiguration model (ECM) efficiently generates a graph with asymptotically\n(almost) any desired degree sequence. We show that the expected running time of\nthis algorithm over the distribution of graphs created by the ECM is controlled\nby the $\\ell_{4/3}$-norm of the degree sequence. Norms of the degree sequence\nare a measure of the heaviness of the tail, and it is precisely this feature\nthat allows non-trivial speedups of simple triangle enumeration algorithms. As\na corollary of our main theorem, we prove expected linear-time performance for\ndegree sequences following a power law with exponent $\\alpha \\geq 7/3$, and\nnon-trivial speedup whenever $\\alpha \\in (2,3)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2014 03:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-07"}

One way to get around this is qualitative modeling because\nit requires few to no quantitative information. One of the most popular\nqualitative modeling approaches is the Boolean network formalism. However,\nBoolean models allow variables to take only two values, which can be too\nsimplistic in some cases. The present work proposes a modeling approach derived\nfrom Boolean networks where continuous logical operators are used and where\nedges can be tuned. Using continuous logical operators allows variables to be\nmore finely valued while remaining qualitative. To consider that some\nbiological interactions can be slower or weaker than other ones, edge states\nare also computed in order to modulate in speed and strength the signal they\nconvey. The proposed formalism is illustrated on a toy network coming from the\nepidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway. The obtained simulations\nshow that continuous results are produced, thus allowing finer analysis. The\nsimulations also show that modulating the signal conveyed by the edges allows\nto incorporate knowledge about the interactions they model. The goal is to\nprovide enhancements in the ability of qualitative models to simulate the\ndynamics of biological networks while limiting the need of quantitative\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2014 06:53:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 19:24:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Aug 2014 07:23:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 12:06:41 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 07:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 2019 19:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-22"}

Since most functions in practice\nare wiggly and do not admit a small LB, we extend this framework by\napproximating a wiggly function, f, by ones which admit a smaller LB and do not\ndeviate from f by more than a specified Bound Deviation (BD). In fact for any\npositive LB, one can find such a BD, thus defining a trade-off function (LB-BD\nfunction) between the variation measure (LB) and the deviation measure (BD). We\nshow that the LB-BD function satisfies nice properties: it is non-increasing\nand convex. We also present a method to obtain it using convex optimization.\nFor a function with given LB and BD, we find the optimal fit and present\ndeterministic bounds for the prediction error of various methods. Given the\nLB-BD function, we discuss picking an appropriate LB-BD pair for fitting and\ncalculating the prediction errors.

In the literature the relaxation process for the above\nmodels has been assumed to be quasi-one dimensional and, in particular, their\nequilibration time has been computed using the relaxation time of the East\nmodel ($d=1$) on the equilibrium length scale $L_c=(1/c)^{1/d}$ in\n$d$-dimension.

The great majority of algorithms proposed in\nthe literature are based on the Branch and Bound method. In this paper, we\npropose an exact algorithm for the maximum clique problem based on the Russian\nDolls Search method. When compared to Branch and Bound, the main difference of\nthe Russian Dolls method is that the nodes of its search tree correspond to\ndecision subproblems, instead of the optimization subproblems of the Branch and\nBound method. In comparison to a first implementation of this Russian Dolls\nmethod from the literature, several improvements are presented. Some of them\nare adaptations of techniques already employed successfully in Branch and Bound\nalgorithms, like the use of approximate coloring for pruning purposes and\nbit-parallel operations. Two different coloring heuristics are tested: the\nstandard greedy and the greedy with recoloring. Other improvements are directly\nrelated to the Russian Dolls scheme: the adoption of recursive calls where each\nsubproblem (doll) is solved itself via the same principles than the Russian\nDolls Search and the application of an elimination rule allowing not to\ngenerate a significant number of dolls. Results of computational experiments\nshow that the algorithm outperforms the best exact combinatorial algorithms in\nthe literature for the great majority of the dense graphs tested, being more\nthan twice faster in several cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2014 12:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jul 2014 11:15:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 00:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-29"}

The connection\nbetween these mechanisms and the resources they protect is, however, only given\nimplicitly; this makes it difficult both for programmers to apply the\nmechanisms correctly and for compilers to check that resources are properly\nprotected. This paper presents a mechanism to automatically check that shared\nmemory is accessed properly, using a methodology called shared ownership. In\ncontrast to traditional ownership, shared ownership offers more flexibility by\npermitting multiple owners of a resource. On the basis of this methodology, we\ndefine an abstract model of resource access that provides operations to manage\ndata dependencies, as well as sharing and transfer of access privileges. The\nmodel is rigorously defined using a formal semantics, and shown to be free from\ndata races. This property can be used to detect unsafe memory accesses when\nsimulating the model together with the execution of a program. The\nexpressiveness and efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on a variety of\nprograms using common synchronization mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2014 14:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-07"}

This behavior is unlike that of the\ncatenoid, which transitions to two disks through a bulk singularity. It is not\nyet understood whether the type of singularity is generally a consequence of\nthe surface topology, nor how this dependence could arise from an equation of\nmotion for the surface. To address these questions we investigate\nexperimentally, computationally, and theoretically the route to singularities\nof soap films with different topologies, including a family of punctured Klein\nbottles. We show that the location of singularities (bulk or boundary) may\ndepend on the path of the boundary deformation. In the unstable regime the\ndriving force for soap-film motion is the mean curvature. Thus, the narrowest\npart of the neck, associated with the shortest nontrivial closed geodesic of\nthe surface, has the highest curvature and is the fastest-moving. Just before\nonset of the instability there exists on the stable surface a shortest closed\ngeodesic, which is the initial condition for evolution of the neck's geodesics,\nall of which have the same topological relationship to the frame. We make the\nplausible conjectures that if the initial geodesic is linked to the boundary\nthen the singularity will occur at the boundary, whereas if the two are\nunlinked initially then the singularity will occur in the bulk. Numerical study\nof mean curvature flows and experiments support these conjectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2014 14:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-07"}

In the\npresent paper, we devote ourselves to test whether the speed of light is\nvarying from the observational data of the type Ia Supernova, Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation, Observational $H(z)$ data and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).\nWe select the common form $c(t)=c_0a^n(t)$ with the contribution of dark energy\nand matter, where $c_0$ is the current value of speed of light, $n$ is a\nconstant, and consequently construct a varying speed of light dark energy model\n(VSLDE). The combined observational data show a much trivial constraint\n$n=-0.0033 \\pm 0.0045$ at 68.3\\% confidence level, which indicates that the\nspeed of light may be a constant with high significance. By reconstructing the\ntime-variable $c(t)$, we find that the speed of light almost has no variation\nfor redshift $z < 10^{-1}$. For high-$z$ observations, they are more sensitive\nto the VSLDE model, but the variation of speed of light is only in order of\n$10^{-2}$. We also introduce the geometrical diagnostic $Om (z)$ to show the\ndifference between the VSLDE and $\\Lambda$CDM model. The result shows that the\ncurrent data are difficult to differentiate them. All the results show that the\nobservational data favor the constant speed of light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2014 15:56:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 05:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

Here we rely on the precise\nrecords of daily vehicle mobility based on GPS positioning device installed in\ntaxis to uncover the potential daily predictability of urban traffic patterns.\nUsing the mapping from the degree of congestion on roads into a time series of\nsymbols and measuring its entropy, we find a relatively high daily\npredictability of traffic conditions despite the absence of any a priori\nknowledge of drivers' origins and destinations and quite different travel\npatterns between weekdays and weekends. Moreover, we find a counterintuitive\ndependence of the predictability on travel speed: the road segment associated\nwith intermediate average travel speed is most difficult to be predicted. We\nalso explore the possibility of recovering the traffic condition of an\ninaccessible segment from its adjacent segments with respect to limited\nobservability. The highly predictable traffic patterns in spite of the\nheterogeneity of drivers' behaviors and the variability of their origins and\ndestinations enables development of accurate predictive models for eventually\ndevising practical strategies to mitigate urban road congestion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Jul 2014 10:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-27"}

The key\nquestion is if and to what extent these scattering patterns contain volumetric\ninformation, and what model can retrieve it. The scattering model of protein\ncrystallography is valid for very small crystals or those like crystalized\nbiomolecules with small coherent subunits. But in the general case, it fails to\nmodel the integrated intensities of diffraction spots, and cannot even find the\nsize of the crystal. The more rigorous and less employed alternative is a\npurely-classical crystal-specific model, which bypasses the fundamental notion\nof bulk and hence the non-classical X-ray scattering from bulk. This\ncontribution is Part 1 out of two reports, in which we seek to clarify the\nassumptions of some different regimes and models of X-ray scattering and their\nimplications for single particle imaging. In this part, first basic concepts\nand existing models are briefly reviewed. Then the predictions of the\nconventional and the rigorous models for emerging scattering patterns of\nprotein nanocrystals (intermediate case between conventional crystals and\nsingle particles) are contrasted, and the terminology conflict regarding\n\"Diffraction Theory\" is addressed. With a clearer picture of crystal\nscattering, Part 2 will focus on additional concepts, limitations, correction\nschemes, and alternative models relevant to single particles. Aside from such\noptical details, protein crystallography is an advanced tool of analytical\nchemistry and not a self-contained optical imaging technique (despite\nsignificant instrumental role of optical data).
