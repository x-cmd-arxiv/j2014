This results in\nspecific observational signatures that are not found in standard models of\ninflation: a non-trivial angular dependence for the squeezed bispectrum, and a\npossibly long period of anisotropic inflation (to drive inflation, the \"solid\"\nmust be very insensitive to any deformation, and thus background anisotropies\nare very slowly erased). In this paper we compute the expected level of\nstatistical anisotropy in the power spectrum of the curvature perturbations of\nthis model. To do so, we account for the classical background values of the\nthree scalar fields that are generated on large (superhorizon) scales during\ninflation via a random walk sum, as the perturbation modes leave the horizon.\nSuch an anisotropy is unavoidably generated, even starting from perfectly\nisotropic classical initial conditions. The expected level of anisotropy is\nrelated to the duration of inflation and to the amplitude of the squeezed\nbispectrum. If this amplitude is close to its current observational limit (so\nthat one of the most interesting predictions of the model can be observed in\nthe near future), we find that a level of statistical anisotropy $\\gtrsim 3\\%$\nin the power spectrum is to be expected, if inflation lasted $\\gtrsim 20-30$\ne-folds more than the final $50-60$ efolds required to generare the CMB modes.\nWe also comment and point out various similarities between solid inflation and\nmodels of inflation where a suitable coupling of the inflaton to a vector\nkinetic term $F^{2}$ gives frozen and scale invariant vector perturbations on\nsuperhorizon scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 17:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-11"}

However, the ionization state can depend on the gas dynamics, because\nelectric fields induced by MHD turbulence can heat up plasmas and thereby\naffect the ionization balance. To study this nonlinear feedback, we construct\nan ionization model that includes plasma heating by electric fields and impact\nionization by heated electrons, as well as charging of dust grains. We show\nthat when plasma sticking onto grains is the dominant recombination process,\nthe electron abundance in the gas decreases with increasing electric field\nstrength. This is a natural consequence of electron-grain collisions whose\nfrequency increases with electron's random velocity. The decreasing electron\nabundance may lead to a self-regulation of MHD turbulence. In some cases, not\nonly the electron abundance but also the electric current decreases with\nincreasing field strength in a certain field range. The resulting N-shaped\ncurrent--field relation violates the fundamental assumption of the\nnon-relativistic MHD that the electric field is uniquely determined by the\ncurrent density. At even higher field strengths, impact ionization causes an\nabrupt increase of the electric current as expected by previous studies.

Furthermore, strong electron correlations are present in the system, which\nmay interact with the novel topological phase. Applying spin- and\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) to the Kondo insulator SmB6,\na promising TKI candidate, we reveal that the surface states of SmB6 are spin\npolarized, and the spin is locked to the crystal momentum.

A lower bound for the Higgs mass arises for the\nclass of standard bare potentials of \\phi^4 type from the requirement of a\nwell-defined functional integral (i.e., stability of the bare potential). This\nconsistency bound can however be relaxed considerably by more general forms of\nthe bare potential without necessarily introducing new meta-stable minima.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 16:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This approach provides new\ninsights into the origin of a fundamental mass scale and the physics underlying\nconfinement dynamics in QCD in the limit of massless quarks. The result is a\nrelativistic light-front wave equation for arbitrary spin with an effective\nconfinement potential derived from a conformal action and its embedding in AdS\nspace. This equation allows for the computation of essential features of hadron\nspectra in terms of a single scale. The light-front holographic methods\ndescribed here gives a precise interpretation of holographic variables and\nquantities in AdS in terms of light-front variables and quantum numbers. This\nleads to a relation between the AdS wave functions and the boost-invariant\nlight-front wave functions describing the internal structure of hadronic bound\nstates in physical space-time. The pion is massless in the chiral limit and the\nexcitation spectra of relativistic light-quark meson and baryon bound states\nlie on linear Regge trajectories with identical slopes in the radial and\norbital quantum numbers. In the light-front holographic approach described here\ncurrents are expressed as an infinite sum of poles, and form factors as a\nproduct of poles. At large $q^2$ the form factor incorporates the correct\npower-law fall-off for hard scattering independent of the specific dynamics and\nis dictated by the twist. At low $q^2$ the form factor leads to vector\ndominance. The approach is also extended to include small quark masses. We\nbriefly review in this report other holographic approaches to QCD, in\nparticular top-down and bottom-up models based on chiral symmetry breaking. We\nalso include a discussion of open problems and future applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 17:23:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 18:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

Furthermore, we address the possibility\nthat in a wide class of 4d CFTs, the flat space spherical Renyi entropy also\nfixes the $n$-dependence of the extrinsic curvature contribution, and hence\nthat of arbitrary entangling surfaces. Our results have intriguing implications\nfor the structure of generic modular Hamiltonians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 19:45:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Aug 2014 22:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In atomic\nnuclei the momentum distribution of nucleons above the Fermi momentum ($k>k_F\n\\approx 250$ Mev/c) is also dominated by short rangecorrelated\ndifferent-fermion (neutron-proton) pairs.\n  Purpose: Compare high-momentum unlike-fermion momentum distributions in\natomic and nuclear systems.\n  Methods: We show that, for $k>k_F$ MeV/c, nuclear momentum distributions are\nproportional to that of the deuteron.

Despite the rather\nlow hypercolor confinement scale of ~100 GeV, the new strongly interacting\nsector is stealth. It is shielded from present direct and indirect NP searches\nsince the light resonances are QCD singlets, whereas the production of the\nheavier QCD colored resonances leads predominantly to high multiplicity final\nstates. Improved searches can potentially be devised using top tagged final\nstates or decays into a small number of hypercolor pions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 20:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We predict that the ShaneAO\nsystem will measure lower sky backgrounds and achieve 20\\% higher throughput\nacross the $JHK$ bands despite having more optical surfaces than the current\nsystem. It will enable imaging of fainter objects (by 1-2 magnitudes) and will\nbe faster to reach a fiducial signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 10-13.

Massive galaxies tend to inhabit very massive halos such as\ngalaxy groups and clusters. We aim to understand whether the observed \"galaxy\ndownsizing\" could be interpreted as a \"halo downsizing\", whereas the most\nmassive halos, and their galaxy populations, evolve more rapidly than the halos\nof lower mass. Thus, we study the contribution to the CSFH of galaxies\ninhabiting group-sized halos. This is done through the study of the evolution\nof the Infra-Red (IR) luminosity function of group galaxies from redshift 0 to\n~1.6. We use a sample of 39 X-ray selected groups in the Extended Chandra Deep\nField South (ECDFS), the Chandra Deep Field North (CDFN), and the COSMOS field,\nwhere the deepest available mid- and far-IR surveys have been conducted with\nSpitzer MIPS and Hersche PACS. Groups at low redshift lack the brightest,\nrarest, and most star forming IR-emitting galaxies observed in the field. Their\nIR-emitting galaxies contribute <10% of the comoving volume density of the\nwhole IR galaxy population in the local Universe. At redshift >~1, the most\nIR-luminous galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) are preferentially located in groups,\nand this is consistent with a reversal of the star-formation rate vs .density\nanti-correlation observed in the nearby Universe. At these redshifts, group\ngalaxies contribute 60-80% of the CSFH, i.e. much more than at lower redshifts.\nBelow z~1, the comoving number and SFR densities of IR-emitting galaxies in\ngroups decline significantly faster than those of all IR-emitting galaxies. Our\nresults are consistent with a \"halo downsizing\" scenario and highlight the\nsignificant role of \"environment\" quenching in shaping the CSFH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 20:59:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 13:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The source is variable\nduring the observation, with the variability concentrated at low energies,\nwhich suggesting either a relativistic reflection or a variable absorption\nscenario. In this work we focus on the reflection interpretation, making use of\nnew relativistic reflection models that self consistently calculate the\nreflection fraction, relativistic blurring and angle-dependent reflection\nspectrum for different coronal heights to model the spectra. We find that the\nspectra can be well fit with relativistic reflection, and that the lowest flux\nstate spectrum is described by reflection alone, suggesting the effects of\nextreme light-bending occurring within ~2 gravitational radii of the event\nhorizon.

In\nthis work we investigate if the very same process of assembly and growth of\nstructures is one of the major drivers of the observed decline. We study the\ncontribution to the CSFH of galaxies in halos of different masses. This is done\nby studying the total SFR-halo mass-redshift plane from redshift 0 to redshift\nz~1.6 in a sample of 57 groups and clusters by using the deepest available mid-\nand far-infrared surveys conducted with Spitzer MIPS and Herschel PACS and\nSPIRE. Our results show that low mass groups provide a 60-80% contribution to\nthe CSFH at z~1. Such contribution declines faster than the CSFH in the last 8\nbillion years to less than 10% at z<0.3, where the overall SF activity is\nsustained by lower mass halos. More massive systems provide only a marginal\ncontribution (<10%) at any epoch. A simplified abundance matching method shows\nthat the large contribution of low mass groups at z~1 is due to a large\nfraction (>50%) of very massive, highly star forming Main Sequence galaxies.\nBelow z~1 a quenching process must take place in massive halos to cause the\nobserved faster suppression of their SF activity. Such process must be a slow\none though, as most of the models implementing a rapid quenching of the SF\nactivity in accreting satellites significantly underpredicts the observed SF\nlevel in massive halos at any redshift. Starvation or the transition from cold\nto hot accretion would provide a quenching timescale of 1 Gyrs more consistent\nwith the observations. Our results suggest a scenario in which, due to the\nstructure formation process, more and more galaxies experience the group\nenvironment and, thus, the associated quenching process. This leads to the\nprogressive suppression of their SF activity shaping the CSFH below z~1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 22:18:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 11:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-22"}

Dense deployments\nare expected to provide a linear capacity scaling with the number of small\ncells deployed due to spatial reuse gains. However in practice network capacity\nis severely limited in dense networks due to interference. The primary reason\nis that the current LTE control plane deployment model has very high latency\nand is unable to cope with the demand of implementing interference management\ntechniques that require coordination on a millisecond timeframe.\n  This paper presents SwiftC, a novel low-latency control plane design for LTE\nnetworks. SwiftC's novel contribution is a design for efficiently sending and\nreceiving control plane messages over the LTE spectrum itself, thus creating a\ndirect and low-latency coordination signaling link between small cells and the\nmacrocell. SwiftC builds on recent work in full duplex radios and shows via\nprototype implementations that a low latency control plane can be built over\nthe existing LTE network without wasting licensed spectrum. We also show the\nbenefits of SwiftC in implementing complex interference management techniques,\nand show that with SwiftC small cell deployments can achieve almost a linear\ncapacity scaling with every small cell deployed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2014 00:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-01"}

They may be inherent to the problem---e.g., in\ndetermining the relationship between genetics and the presence or absence of a\ndisease---or they may be a result of extreme quantization. In one-bit\ncompressed sensing it has recently been shown that the number of one-bit\nmeasurements required for signal estimation mirrors that of unquantized\ncompressed sensing. Indeed, $s$-sparse signals in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ can be\nestimated (up to normalization) from $\\Omega(s \\log (n/s))$ one-bit\nmeasurements. Nevertheless, controlling the precise accuracy of the error\nestimate remains an open challenge. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the\ndecay of the error as a function of the oversampling factor $\\lambda := m/(s\n\\log(n/s))$, where $m$ is the number of measurements. It is known that the\nerror in reconstructing sparse signals from standard one-bit measurements is\nbounded below by $\\Omega(\\lambda^{-1})$. Without adjusting the measurement\nprocedure, reducing this polynomial error decay rate is impossible. However, we\nshow that an adaptive choice of the thresholds used for quantization may lower\nthe error rate to $e^{-\\Omega(\\lambda)}$. This improves upon guarantees for\nother methods of adaptive thresholding as proposed in Sigma-Delta quantization.\nWe develop a general recursive strategy to achieve this exponential decay and\ntwo specific polynomial-time algorithms which fall into this framework, one\nbased on convex programming and one on hard thresholding.

We present two-dimensional axisymmetric\nhydrodynamical simulations which start from a collapsar engine and evolve all\nthe way through the late afterglow phase. The resultant outflow includes a jet\ncore which is highly relativistic after breaking out of the star, but becomes\nbaryon-loaded after colliding with a massive outer shell, corresponding to mass\nfrom the stellar atmosphere of the progenitor star which became trapped in\nfront of the jet core at breakout. The prompt emission produced before or\nduring this collision would then have the signature of a high Lorentz factor\njet, but the afterglow is produced by the amalgamated post-collision ejecta\nwhich has more inertia than the original highly relativistic jet core and thus\nhas a delayed deceleration.

The steady state Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations with\nsteric effects (PNP-steric equations) describe steady current through the open\nchannel quite well, in a wide variety of conditions. Here we study the\nexistence of multiple solutions of steady state PNP-steric equations to see if\nthey themselves, without modification or augmentation, can describe two levels\nof current.

While the\nfirst attempts on construction were succesful, scalability has never been\nachieved, due to the inherent fragile nature of the quantum bits (qubits). From\nthe multitude of approaches to achieve scalability topological quantum\ncomputing (TQC) is the most promising one, by being based on an flexible\napproach to error-correction and making use of the straightforward\nmeasurement-based computing technique. TQC circuits are defined within a large,\nuniform, 3-dimensional lattice of physical qubits produced by the hardware and\nthe physical volume of this lattice directly relates to the resources required\nfor computation. Circuit optimization may result in non-intuitive mismatches\nbetween circuit specification and implementation. In this paper we introduce\nthe first method for cross-level validation of TQC circuits. The specification\nof the circuit is expressed based on the stabilizer formalism, and the\nstabilizer table is checked by mapping the topology on the physical qubit\nlevel, followed by quantum circuit simulation. Simulation results show that\ncross-level validation of error-corrected circuits is feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2014 07:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-01"}

FFT costs O(N \\log N) for transforming a signal of length N.\nRecently, Sparse Fourier Transform (SFT) has emerged as a critical issue\naddressing how to compute a compressed Fourier transform of a signal with\ncomplexity being related to the sparsity of its spectrum. In this paper, a new\nSFT algorithm is proposed for both exactly K-sparse signals (with K non-zero\nfrequencies) and generally K-sparse signals (with K significant frequencies),\nwith the assumption that the distribution of the non-zero frequencies is\nuniform. The nuclear idea is to downsample the input signal at the beginning;\nthen, subsequent processing operates under downsampled signals, where signal\nlengths are proportional to O(K). Downsampling, however, possibly leads to\n\"aliasing.\" By the shift property of DFT, we recast the aliasing problem as\ncomplex Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes solved by syndrome decoding.

The morphology evolution of thin\nfilms is governed by surface diffusion and contact line migration. The\nmathematical model is based on an energy variational approach. Anisotropic\nsurface energies lead to multiple solutions of the contact angle equation at\ncontact points. Introduction of a finite contact point mobility is both\nphysically based and leads to robust, unambiguous determination of the contact\nangles. We implement the mathematical model in an explicit finite difference\nscheme with cubic spline interpolation for evolving marker points. Following\nvalidation of the mathematical and numerical approaches, we simulate the\nevolution of thin film islands, semi-infinite films, and films with holes as a\nfunction of film dimensions, Young's angle $\\theta_i$, anisotropy strength and\ncrystal symmetry, and film crystal orientation relative to the substrate\nnormal.

NGC4194\nis particularly interesting to study since its FIR-to-CO luminosity ratio\nrivals that of ULIRGs,despite its lower luminosity compared to ULIRGs, which\nindicates a high star formation efficiency that is relative to even most\nspirals and ULIRGs.We study the molecular medium at an angular resolution of\n0.65\"x .52\" through our observations of CO2-1 emission using the SMA. We\ncompare our CO2-1 maps with optical HST and high angular resolution radio\ncontinuum images to study the relationship between molecular gas and other\ncomponents of the starburst region. The molecular gas is tracing the\ncomplicated dust lane structure of NGC4194 with the brightest emission being\nlocated in an off-nuclear ring-like structure with ~320pc radius, the Eye of\nthe Medusa. The bulk CO emission of the ring is found south of the kinematical\ncenter of NGC4194. The northern tip of the ring is associated with the galaxy\nnucleus, where the radio continuum has its peak. A prominent, secondary\nemission maximum in the radio continuum is located inside the molecular ring.\nThis suggests that the morphology of the ring is partially influenced by\nmassive supernova explosions. From the combined evidence, we propose that the\nEye of the Medusa contains a shell of swept up material where we identify a\nnumber of giant molecular associations. We propose that the Eye may be the site\nof an efficient starburst of 5-7M_sun/yr, but it would still constitute only a\nfraction of the 30-50M_sun/yr SFR of NGC4194. Furthermore, we find that ~50% of\nthe molecular mass of NGC4194 is found in extended filamentary-like structures\ntracing the minor and major axis dust lanes. We suggest that molecular gas is\ntransported along these lanes providing the central starburst region with fuel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2014 10:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-10"}

However, these factors have explained only a\nsmall fraction of these traits' genetic heritability. It is argued that many\nmore genetic factors remain undiscovered. These genetic factors likely are\nweakly associated at the population level and sparsely distributed across the\ngenome. In this paper, we adapt the recent innovations on Tukey's Higher\nCriticism (Tukey [The Higher Criticism (1976) Princeton Univ.]; Donoho and Jin\n[Ann. Statist. 32 (2004) 962-994]) to SNP-set analysis of GWAS, and develop a\nnew theoretical framework in large-scale inference to assess the joint\nsignificance of such rare and weak effects for a quantitative trait. In the\ncore of our theory is the so-called detection boundary, a curve in the\ntwo-dimensional phase space that quantifies the rarity and strength of genetic\neffects. Above the detection boundary, the overall effects of genetic factors\nare strong enough for reliable detection. Below the detection boundary, the\ngenetic factors are simply too rare and too weak for reliable detection. We\nshow that the HC-type methods are optimal in that they reliably yield detection\nonce the parameters of the genetic effects fall above the detection boundary\nand that many commonly used SNP-set methods are suboptimal. The superior\nperformance of the HC-type approach is demonstrated through simulations and the\nanalysis of a GWAS data set of Crohn's disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2014 12:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-01"}

These\nobservations are difficult to interpret in terms of basic physical mechanisms\nand quantities. To fully understand CMEs we need to compare equivalent\nquantities derived from both observations and theoretical models. To this end\nwe aim to produce synthesised AIA observations from simluations of a flux rope\nejection. To carry this out we include the role of thermal conduction and\nradiative losses, both of which are important for determining the temperature\ndistribution of the solar corona during a CME. We perform a simulation where a\nflux rope is ejected from the solar corona. From the density and temperature of\nthe plasma in the simulation we synthesise AIA observations. The emission is\nthen integrated along the line of sight using the instrumental response\nfunction of AIA. We sythesise observations of AIA in the channels at 304 A, 171\nA, 335 A, and 94 A.

The properties of\nclusters' RR Lyrae belonging to other Oostheroff groups (OoInt and OoIII) are\ninstead not well reproduced. While for OoIII clusters a larger helium abundance\nfor a fraction of the cluster's stars can reconcile the model prediction with\nobservations, some other parameter affecting both the Horizontal Branch\nmorphology and the RR Lyrae periods is required to reproduce the behavior of\nOoInt clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2014 14:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Re-analysis\nof mid-infrared imagery from the Spitzer Space Telescope shows that this IRDC\nis at least 2, and possibly as many as 5 times longer than had originally been\nclaimed by Nessie's discoverers (Jackson et al. 2010); its aspect ratio is\ntherefore at least 300:1, and possibly as large as 800:1. A careful accounting\nfor both the Sun's offset from the Galactic plane ($\\sim 25$ pc) and the\nGalactic center's offset from the $(l^{II},b^{II})=(0,0)$ position shows that\nthe latitude of the true Galactic mid-plane at the 3.1 kpc distance to the\nScutum-Centaurus Arm is not $b=0$, but instead closer to $b=-0.4$, which is the\nlatitude of Nessie to within a few pc. An analysis of the radial velocities of\nlow-density (CO) and high-density (${\\rm NH}_3$) gas associated with the Nessie\ndust feature suggests that Nessie runs along the Scutum-Centaurus Arm in\nposition-position-velocity space, which means it likely forms a dense `spine'\nof the arm in real space as well. The Scutum-Centaurus arm is the closest major\nspiral arm to the Sun toward the inner Galaxy, and, at the longitude of Nessie,\nit is almost perpendicular to our line of sight, making Nessie the easiest\nfeature to see as a shadow elongated along the Galactic Plane from our\nlocation. Future high-resolution dust mapping and molecular line observations\nof the harder-to-find Galactic \"bones\" should allow us to exploit the Sun's\nposition above the plane to gain a (very foreshortened) view \"from above\" of\nthe Milky Way's structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2014 15:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}
