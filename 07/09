We find that a scenario with an exact $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry\nin the potential cannot be valid beyond about 10 TeV without the intervention\nof additional physics. On the other hand, when the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is\nbroken, the theory can be valid even up to the Planck scale without any new\nphysics coming in. The interesting feature we point out is that such high-scale\nvalidity is irrespective of the uncertainty in the top quark mass as well as\n$\\alpha_{s}(M_Z)$, in contrast with the standard model with a single Higgs\ndoublet. It is also shown that the presence of a CP-violating phase is allowed\nwhen the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is relaxed. The allowed regions in the\nparameter space are presented for each case.

In a data\nset with $n$ observations and $p$ variables, under the CCM, an outlier is a\nunit, even if only one or few values are corrupted. Classical robust procedures\nwere designed to cope with this setting and the impact of observations were\nlimited whenever necessary.

In\nthis new setting each cell of the data matrix might be corrupted or not with a\nprobability independent on the status of the other cells.

The model takes four times the density scale height as the integral\n(driving) scale of the vertical motions at each depth. Scales larger than this\ndecay with height from the deeper layers. Those smaller are assumed to follow a\nKolomogorov turbulent cascade, with the total power in the vertical convective\nmotions matching that required to transport the solar luminosity in a mixing\nlength formulation. These model components are validated using large scale\nradiative hydrodynamic simulations. We reach two primary conclusions: 1. The\nmodel predicts significantly more power at low wavenumbers than is observed in\nthe solar photospheric horizontal velocity spectrum. 2. Ionization plays a\nminor role in shaping the observed solar velocity spectrum by reducing\nconvective amplitudes in the regions of partial helium ionization. The excess\nlow wavenumber power is also seen in the fully nonlinear three-dimensional\nradiative hydrodynamic simulations employing a realistic equation of state.\nThis adds to other recent evidence suggesting that the amplitudes of large\nscale convective motions in the Sun are significantly lower than expected.\nEmploying the same feature tracking algorithm used with observational data on\nthe simulation output, we show that the observed low wavenumber power can be\nreproduced in hydrodynamic models if the amplitudes of large scale modes in the\ndeep layers are artificially reduced. Since the large scale modes have reduced\namplitudes, modes on the scale of supergranulation and smaller remain important\nto convective heat flux even in the deep layers, suggesting that small scale\nconvective correlations are maintained through the bulk of the solar convection\nzone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 18:45:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jul 2014 20:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The author proved a\nyear ago (arXiv: 1305.6289) that J contains an interval of type [0,c] with a\npositive ineffective value c. In the present work we extend this result for a\nlarge class of normalizing functions. The only essential requirement is that\nthe function f(n) replacing logn should satisfy\nf(n)<<lognloglognloglogloglogn/(logloglogn)^2 (with a small implied constant),\nthe well-known Erd\\\"os-Rankin bound for the largest known gaps between\nconsecutive primes. The work also proves that apart from a thin set of\nexceptional functions the original Erd\\\"os conjecture holds if logn is replaced\nby a non-exceptional function f(n). The paper also gives a new proof for a\nresult of Helmut Maier which generalized the Erd\\\"os-Rankin bound for an\narbitrarily long finite chain of consecutive primegaps. The proof uses a\ncombination of methods of Erd\\\"os-Rankin,Maynard-Tao and\nBanks-Freiberg-Maynard.

In this new version we prove the same\nassertions as in the original work for the case when\nf(n)<<Clognloglognloglogloglogn/(logloglogn)^2 with an arbi8trarily large\nconstant C, in particular we show that there are blocks of m primes for any m\nsuch that all gaps between these primes simultaneously satisfy the lower\nestimate Clognloglognloglogloglogn/(logloglogn)^2 with an arbitrarily large\nconstant C.

We study CO depletion in\n102 massive clumps selected from the ATLASGAL 870 micron survey, and\ninvestigate its correlation with evolutionary stage and with the physical\nparameters of the sources. Moreover, we study the gradients in [12C]/[13C] and\n[18O]/[17O] isotopic ratios across the inner Galaxy, and the virial stability\nof the clumps. We use low-J emission lines of CO isotopologues and the dust\ncontinuum emission to infer the depletion factor fD. RATRAN one-dimensional\nmodels were also used to determine fD and to investigate the presence of\ndepletion above a density threshold. The isotopic ratios and optical depth were\nderived with a Bayesian approach. We find a significant number of clumps with a\nlarge fD, up to ~20. Larger values are found for colder clumps, thus for\nearlier evolutionary phases. For massive clumps in the earliest stages of\nevolution we estimate the radius of the region where CO depletion is important\nto be a few tenths of a pc. Clumps are found with total masses derived from\ndust continuum emission up to ~20 times higher than the virial mass, especially\namong the less evolved sources. These large values may in part be explained by\nthe presence of depletion: if the CO emission comes mainly from the low-density\nouter layers, the molecules may be subthermally excited, leading to an\noverestimate of the dust masses. CO depletion in high-mass clumps seems to\nbehave as in the low-mass regime, with less evolved clumps showing larger\nvalues for the depletion than their more evolved counterparts, and increasing\nfor denser sources. The C and O isotopic ratios are consistent with previous\ndeterminations, and show a large intrinsic scatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 19:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

However, there have been few Bayesian procedures\namong this work. Here, we develop a Bayesian model for structured sparsity that\nuses a Gaussian process (GP) to share parameters of the sparsity-inducing prior\nin proportion to feature similarity as defined by an arbitrary positive\ndefinite kernel. For linear regression, this sparsity-inducing prior on\nregression coefficients is a relaxation of the canonical spike-and-slab prior\nthat flattens the mixture model into a scale mixture of normals. This prior\nretains the explicit posterior probability on inclusion parameters---now with\nGP probit prior distributions---but enables tractable computation via\nelliptical slice sampling for the latent Gaussian field. We motivate\ndevelopment of this prior using the genomic application of association mapping,\nor identifying genetic variants associated with a continuous trait. Our\nBayesian structured sparsity model produced sparse results with substantially\nimproved sensitivity and precision relative to comparable methods. Through\nsimulations, we show that three properties are key to this improvement: i)\nmodeling structure in the covariates, ii) significance testing using the\nposterior probabilities of inclusion, and iii) model averaging.

Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the broad\ndistribution of spin-orbit angles among exoplanets, and these theories fall\nunder two broad categories. The first is based on dynamical interactions in a\nmulti-body system, while the other assumes that disk migration is the driving\nmechanism in planetary configuration and that the star (or disk) is titled with\nrespect to the planetary plane.

The\npuzzling distribution of the positrons gave rise to various suggestions,\nincluding stellar nucleosynthesis in core-collapse (CC) and type Ia\nthermonuclear supernovae (SNe), accreting compact objects, and more \"exotic\"\nexplanations of annihilation of dark-matter particles.

A greatly improved\ncensus of the likely progenitor class, including the most luminous evolved\nstars, the Luminous Blue Varaibles (LBVs), and the warm and cool hypergiants is\nnow needed for a complete picture of the final pre-SN stages of very massive\nstars. We have begun a survey of the evolved and un stable luminous star\npopulations in several nearby resolved galaxies. In this second paper on M31\nand M33, we review the spectral characteristics, spectral energy distributions,\ncircumstellar ejecta, and evidence for mass loss for 82 luminous and variable\nstars.We show that many of these stars have warm circumstellar dust including\nseveral of the Fe II emission line stars, but conclude that the confirmed LBVs\nin M31 and M33 do not. The confirmed LBVs have relatively low wind speeds even\nin their hot, quiescent or visual minimum state compared to the B-type\nsupergiants and Of/WN stars which they spectroscopically resemble. The nature\nof the Fe II emis sion line stars and their relation to the LBV state remains\nuncertain, but some have properties in common with the warm hypergiants and the\nsgB[e] stars. Several individual stars are discussed in detail. We identify\nthree possible candidate LBVs and three additional post-red supergiant\ncandidates. We suggest that M33-013406.63 (UIT301,B416) is not an LBV/S Dor\nvariable, but is a very luminous late O-type supergiant and one of the most\nluminous stars or pair of stars in M33.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 20:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We show how to use the persistence algorithm\nto organize these computations. In the first stage, any algorithm can be used\nto produce a cover of the input complex. We describe an algorithm for producing\na cover of a space with a simple structure and bounded overlap based on graph\npartitions. Additionally, we present a simplistic model for the problem of\nfinding covers appropriate for parallel algorithms and show that finding such\ncovers is NP-Hard. Finally, we present a second parallel homology algorithm.\nThis algorithm avoids the explicit construction of the blowup complex saving\nspace. We implement our algorithms for multicore computers, and compare them\nagainst each other as well as existing serial and parallel algorithms with a\nsuite of experiments. We achieve roughly 8x speedup of the homology\ncomputations on a 10-dimensional complex with about 46 million simplices using\n11 cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 21:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-10"}

Our analysis allows us create a\ntaxonomy of the chase variations and the properties they satisfy. Two of the\nmost central problems regarding the chase is termination, and discovery of\nrestricted classes of sets of dependencies that guarantee termination of the\nchase. The search for the restricted classes has been motivated by a fairly\nrecent result that shows that it is undecidable to determine whether the chase\nwith a given dependency set will terminate on a given instance. There is a\nsmall dissonance here, since the quest has been for classes of sets of\ndependencies guaranteeing termination of the chase on all instances, even\nthough the latter problem was not known to be undecidable. We resolve the\ndissonance in this paper by showing that determining whether the chase with a\ngiven set of dependencies terminates on all instances is coRE-complete. For the\nhardness proof we use a reduction from word rewriting systems, thereby also\nshowing the close connection between the chase and word rewriting. The same\nreduction also gives us the aforementioned instance-dependent RE-completeness\nresult as a byproduct.

To achieve the contrast required for the desired science, it is\nnecessary to quantify and mitigate wavefront error (WFE). A large source of\npotential static WFE arises from the primary AO wavefront sensor (WFS)\ndetector's use of multiple readout segments with independent signal chains\nincluding on-chip preamplifiers and external amplifiers. Temperature changes\nwithin GPI's electronics cause drifts in readout segments' bias levels,\ninducing an RMS WFE of 1.1 nm and 41.9 nm over 4.44 degrees Celsius, for\nmagnitude 4 and 11 stars, respectively. With a goal of $<$2 nm of static WFE,\nthese are significant enough to require remedial action. Simulations imply a\nrequirement to take fresh WFS darks every 2 degrees Celsius of temperature\nchange, for a magnitude 6 star; similarly, for a magnitude 7 star, every 1\ndegree Celsius of temperature change. For sufficiently dim stars, bias drifts\nexceed the signal, causing a large initial WFE, and the former periodic\nrequirement practically becomes an instantaneous/continuous one, making the\ngoal of $<$2 nm of static WFE very difficult for stars of magnitude 9 or\nfainter. In extreme cases, this can cause the AO loops to destabilize due to\nperceived nonphysical wavefronts, as some of the WFS's Shack-Hartmann quadcells\nare split between multiple readout segments. Presented here is GPI's AO WFS\ngeometry, along with detailed steps in the simulation used to quantify bias\ndrift related WFE, followed by laboratory and on sky results, and concluded\nwith possible methods of remediation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 00:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Based on the\nmodel, we analyze the energy-delay tradeoffs of a VBS considering BS sleeping\nand state switching cost to minimize the weighted sum of power consumption and\naverage delay. We derive the explicit form of the optimal data transmission\nrate and find the condition under which the energy optimal rate exists and is\nunique. Opportunities to reduce the average delay and achieve energy savings\nsimultaneously are observed. We further propose an efficient algorithm to\njointly optimize the data rate and the number of CPU cores. Numerical results\nvalidate our theoretical analyses and under a typical simulation setting we\nfind more than 60% energy savings can be achieved by VBSs compared with\nconventional base stations under the EARTH model, which demonstrates the great\npotential of VBSs in 5G cellular systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 00:45:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 15:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

The flaring activity of\nthe source is studied by investigating the properties of daily light curves\nfrom radio to $TeV$ energy range and we present the correlation and variability\nanalysis in each energy band. The $TeV$ flare detected by $TACTIC$ on February\n16, 2010 is well correlated with the activity in lower energy bands. The\ndifferential energy spectrum of the source, in the energy range 1.5-11 TeV, as\nmeasured by $TACTIC$ on this night is described by a power law ($dN/dE \\propto\nE^{-\\Gamma}$) with spectral index $\\Gamma = 2.6\\pm0.3$. After accounting for\nabsorption of $TeV$ photons by low energy extragalactic background light\nphotons via pair production, the intrinsic $TeV$ spectrum reveals a power law\nindex of $2.3\\pm0.3$. Finally the broad band spectral energy distribution of\nthe source in flaring state is reproduced using a simple emission model\ninvolving synchrotron and synchrotron self Compton processes. The obtained\nparameters are then used to understand the energetics of the source during the\nflaring episode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 05:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The mass of the four planets can be\nestimated from either the beaming or the ellipsoidal amplitude, given the mass\nand radius of their parent stars. For KOI-13, HAT-P-7, and Kepler-76 we find\nthat the beaming-based planetary mass estimate is larger than the mass\nestimated from the ellipsoidal amplitude, consistent with previous studies.\nThis apparent discrepancy may be explained by equatorial superrotation of the\nplanet atmosphere, which induces an angle shift of the planet\nreflection/emission phase modulation, as was suggested for Kepler-76 in the\nfirst paper of this series. We propose a modified BEER model that supports\nsuperrotation, assuming either a Lambertian or geometric reflection/emission\nphase function, and provides a photometry-consistent estimate of the planetary\nmass. Our analysis shows that for Kepler-76 and HAT-P-7, the Lambertian\nsuperrotation BEER model is highly preferable over an unshifted null model,\nwhile for KOI-13 it is preferable only at a 1.4 sigma level. For TrES-2 we do\nnot find such preference. For all four systems the Lambertian superrotation\nmodel mass estimates are in excellent agreement with the planetary masses\nderived from, or constrained by, radial velocity measurements. This makes the\nLambertian superrotation BEER model a viable tool for estimating the masses of\nhot Jupiters from photometry alone.

In this paper,\nwe propose a new model based on diffraction theory in which the target is\nmodeled as a cylinder instead of a point mass. The proposed model can will\ngreatly fits the experiment measurements and well explain the cases like link\ncrossing and walking along the link line. Because the measurement model is\nnonlinear, particle filtering tracing is used to recursively give the\napproximate Bayesian estimation of the position. The posterior Cramer-Rao lower\nbound (PCRLB) of proposed tracking method is also derived. The results of field\nexperiments with 8 radio sensors and a monitored area of 3.5m 3.5m show that\nthe tracking error of proposed model is improved by at least 36 percent in the\nsingle target case and 25 percent in the two targets case compared to other\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 09:11:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Jul 2014 02:05:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 08:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

We use two different white dwarf cooling models\nto predict the present-day luminosities of halo white dwarfs. We determine the\nwhite dwarf luminosity functions (WDLFs) for eight different halo models and\ncompare these with the observed halo WDLF of white dwarfs in the SuperCOSMOS\nSky Survey.

In the integral field datasets, the galaxy\npresents skewed line profiles changing with position in the galaxy. The skewed\nline profiles are caused by different kinematic components overlapping in the\nline-of-sight direction. We perform spectral decomposition to separate the line\nprofiles in each spatial pixel as combinations of (1) a narrow kinematic\ncomponent consistent with HII regions, (2) a broad kinematic component\nconsistent with shock excitation, and (3) an intermediate component consistent\nwith shock excitation and photoionisation mixing. The three kinematic\ncomponents have distinctly different velocity fields, velocity dispersions,\nline ratios, and electron densities. We model the line ratios, velocity\ndispersions, and electron densities with our MAPPINGS IV shock and\nphotoionisation models, and we reach remarkable agreement between the data and\nthe models. The models demonstrate that the different emission line properties\nare caused by major galactic outflows that introduce shock excitation in\naddition to photoionisation by star-forming activities.

Such flocks are marginally opaque - an external observer can also\njust still see a substantial fraction of sky through the flock. Although\nseemingly intuitive we show that this need not be the case; flocks could easily\nbe highly diffuse or entirely opaque. The emergence of marginal opacity\nstrongly constrains how individuals interact with each other within large\nswarms. It also provides a mechanism for global interactions: An individual can\nrespond to the projection of the flock that it sees. This provides for faster\ninformation transfer and hence rapid flock dynamics, another advantage over\nlocal models. From a behavioural perspective it optimizes the information\navailable to each bird while maintaining the protection of a dense, coherent\nflock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 10:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The outflows around the small protocluster NGC 2071 are an ideal testbed\nto differentiate between various scenarios.\n  Methods: Using Herschel-HIFI and the SMA, observations of CH3OH, H2CO and\nCH3CN emission lines over a wide range of excitation energies were obtained.\nComparisons to a grid of radiative transfer models provide constraints on the\nphysical conditions. Comparison to H2O line shape is able to trace gas-phase\nsynthesis versus a sputtered origin.\n  Results: Emission of organics originates in three spots: the continuum\nsources IRS 1 ('B') and IRS 3 ('A') as well as a outflow position ('F').\nDensities are above 10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures between 100 to 200 K.\nCH3OH emission observed with HIFI originates in all three regions and cannot be\nassociated with a single region. Very little organic emission originates\noutside of these regions.\n  Conclusions: Although the three regions are small (<1,500 AU), gas-phase\norganics likely originate from sputtering of ices due to outflow activity. The\nderived high densities (>10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$) are likely a requirement for organic\nmolecules to survive from being destroyed by shock products. The lack of\nspatially extended emission confirms that organic molecules cannot (re)form\nthrough gas-phase synthesis, as opposed to H2O, which shows strong line wing\nemission. The lack of CH3CN emission at 'F' is evidence for a different history\nof ice processing due to the absence of a protostar at that location and recent\nice mantle evaporation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 10:35:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We show that,\nunder some assumptions, our approach provides estimates that are more precise\nthan the ones obtained from the dataset with a known sampling effort alone.\nWhen the opportunistic data are abundant, the gain in precision may be\nconsiderable, especially for the rare species. We also show that estimates can\nbe obtained even for species recorded only in the opportunistic scheme.\nOpportunistic data combined with a relatively small amount of data collected\nwith a known effort may thus provide access to accurate and precise estimates\nof quantitative changes in relative abundance over space and/or time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 11:00:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 19:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-27"}

The triangle with the longest baselines formed by the GLT,\nthe Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, and the\nSubmillimeter Array (SMA) in Hawaii will play a key role for the M87\nobservations.

Point spread function subtraction via\ndifferential polarimetry suppresses unpolarized starlight by a factor of over\n100, and provides sensitivity to circumstellar dust reaching the photon noise\nlimit for these observations. In the case of the circumstellar disk around HR\n4796A, GPI's advanced adaptive optics system reveals the disk clearly even\nprior to PSF subtraction. In polarized light, the disk is seen all the way in\nto its semi-minor axis for the first time. The disk exhibits surprisingly\nstrong asymmetry in polarized intensity, with the west side >9 times brighter\nthan the east side despite the fact that the east side is slightly brighter in\ntotal intensity. Based on a synthesis of the total and polarized intensities,\nwe now believe that the west side is closer to us, contrary to most prior\ninterpretations. Forward scattering by relatively large silicate dust particles\nleads to the strong polarized intensity on the west side, and the ring must be\nslightly optically thick in order to explain the lower brightness in total\nintensity there. These findings suggest that the ring is geometrically narrow\nand dynamically cold, perhaps shepherded by larger bodies in the same manner as\nSaturn's F ring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 14:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The crux of their approach is to compute an upper bound on\nthe minimum cost of a circulation in a particular network, $C(G,T)$, where $G$\nis the input graph and $T$ is a carefully chosen spanning tree. The cost of\nthis circulation is directly related to the number of edges in a tour output by\ntheir algorithm.

Besides users' feedbacks (e.g.,\nnumerical ratings) on items as usually exploited by some typical recommendation\nalgorithms, there are often some additional data such as users' social circles\nand other behaviors. Such auxiliary data are usually related to users'\npreferences on items behind the numerical ratings. Collaborative recommendation\nwith auxiliary data (CRAD) aims to leverage such additional information so as\nto improve the personalization services, which have received much attention\nfrom both researchers and practitioners.\n  Transfer learning (TL) is proposed to extract and transfer knowledge from\nsome auxiliary data in order to assist the learning task on some target data.\nIn this paper, we consider the CRAD problem from a transfer learning view,\nespecially on how to achieve knowledge transfer from some auxiliary data.\nFirst, we give a formal definition of transfer learning for CRAD (TL-CRAD).\nSecond, we extend the existing categorization of TL techniques (i.e., adaptive,\ncollective and integrative knowledge transfer algorithm styles) with three\nknowledge transfer strategies (i.e., prediction rule, regularization and\nconstraint). Third, we propose a novel generic knowledge transfer framework for\nTL-CRAD. Fourth, we describe some representative works of each specific\nknowledge transfer strategy of each algorithm style in detail, which are\nexpected to inspire further works. Finally, we conclude the paper with some\nsummary discussions and several future directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 01:39:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-11"}

This tool involves a computational algorithm and an\nopen source software (written in C). The method of extending the reticulated\nfunctions defined on 2D networks is an essential key of this algorithm and can\nalso be used for other purposes than data porting. The algorithm allows one to\nbuild the hexagonal raster with a cell size independent from the geometry of\nthe rectangular raster. The extended function is a bi-cubic spline which can\nexactly reconstruct polynomials up to degree three in each variable. We\nvalidate the method by analyzing errors in some theoretical case studies\nfollowed by other studies with real terrain elevation data. We also introduce\nand briefly present an iterative water routing method and use it for validation\non a case with concrete terrain data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 10:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}

We use symbolic automata, where the transition\nfunction is compactly represented using a (multi-terminal) binary decision\ndiagrams (BDD). The key idea consists in computing a bisimulation by exploring\nreachable pairs symbolically, so as to avoid redundancies. This idea can be\ncombined with already existing optimisations, and we show in particular a nice\nintegration with the disjoint sets forest data-structure from Hopcroft and\nKarp's standard algorithm. Then we consider Kleene algebra with tests (KAT), an\nalgebraic theory that can be used for verification in various domains ranging\nfrom compiler optimisation to network programming analysis. This theory is\ndecidable by reduction to language equivalence of automata on guarded strings,\na particular kind of automata that have exponentially large alphabets. We\npropose several methods allowing to construct symbolic automata out of KAT\nexpressions, based either on Brzozowski's derivatives or standard automata\nconstructions. All in all, this results in efficient algorithms for deciding\nequivalence of KAT expressions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 13:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-14"}
