A preliminary version of the\ninstrument equipped with the 350 microns focal plane, has been successfully\ninstalled and tested on APEX telescope in Chile during the 2013 and 2014\naustral winters. This instrument is developed by CEA (Saclay and Grenoble,\nFrance), IAS (France) and University of Manchester (UK) in collaboration with\nESO. We introduce the mechanical and optical design, as well as the cryogenics\nand electronics of the ArTeMiS camera. ArTeMiS detectors are similar to the\nones developed for the Herschel PACS photometer but they are adapted to the\nhigh optical load encountered at APEX site. Ultimately, ArTeMiS will contain 4\nsub-arrays at 200 microns and 2x8 sub-arrays at 350 and 450 microns. We show\npreliminary lab measurements like the responsivity of the instrument to hot and\ncold loads illumination and NEP calculation. Details on the on-sky\ncommissioning runs made in 2013 and 2014 at APEX are shown. We used planets\n(Mars, Saturn, Uranus) to determine the flat-field and to get the flux\ncalibration. A pointing model was established in the first days of the runs.\nThe average relative pointing accuracy is 3 arcsec. The beam at 350 microns has\nbeen estimated to be 8.5 arcsec, which is in good agreement with the beam of\nthe 12 m APEX dish. Several observing modes have been tested, like On-The-Fly\nfor beam-maps or large maps, spirals or raster of spirals for compact sources.\nWith this preliminary version of ArTeMiS, we concluded that the mapping speed\nis already more than 5 times better than the previous 350 microns instrument at\nAPEX. The median NEFD at 350 microns is 600 mJy.s1/2, with best values at 300\nmJy.s1/2. The complete instrument with 5760 pixels and optimized settings will\nbe installed during the first half of 2015.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 16:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Although many cellular components exhibit anomalous\ndiffusion, only recently has the subdiffusive motion been associated with\nnonergodic behavior. These findings have stimulated new questions for their\nimplications in statistical mechanics and cell biology. Is nonergodicity a\ncommon strategy shared by living systems? Which physical mechanisms generate\nit? What are its implications for biological function? Here, we use single\nparticle tracking to demonstrate that the motion of DC-SIGN, a receptor with\nunique pathogen recognition capabilities, reveals nonergodic subdiffusion on\nliving cell membranes. In contrast to previous studies, this behavior is\nincompatible with transient immobilization and therefore it can not be\ninterpreted according to continuous time random walk theory. We show that the\nreceptor undergoes changes of diffusivity, consistent with the current view of\nthe cell membrane as a highly dynamic and diverse environment. Simulations\nbased on a model of ordinary random walk in complex media quantitatively\nreproduce all our observations, pointing toward diffusion heterogeneity as the\ncause of DC-SIGN behavior. By studying different receptor mutants, we further\ncorrelate receptor motion to its molecular structure, thus establishing a\nstrong link between nonergodicity and biological function. These results\nunderscore the role of disorder in cell membranes and its connection with\nfunction regulation. Due to its generality, our approach offers a framework to\ninterpret anomalous transport in other complex media where dynamic\nheterogeneity might play a major role, such as those found, e.g., in soft\ncondensed matter, geology and ecology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 16:28:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 18:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-06"}

Each agent supports an initial opinion or color. We assume\nthat at the onset, the number of agents supporting the plurality color exceeds\nthat of the agents supporting any other color by a sufficiently-large bias. The\ngoal is to provide a protocol that, with high probability, brings the system\ninto the configuration in which all agents support the (initial) plurality\ncolor. We consider the Undecided-State Dynamics, a well-known protocol which\nuses just one more state (the undecided one) than those necessary to store\ncolors. We show that the speed of convergence of this protocol depends on the\ninitial color configuration as a whole, not just on the gap between the\nplurality and the second largest color community. This dependence is best\ncaptured by a novel notion we introduce, namely, the monochromatic distance\n${md}(\\bar{\\mathbf{c}})$ which measures the distance of the initial color\nconfiguration $\\bar{ \\mathbf {c}}$ from the closest monochromatic one. In the\ncomplete graph, we prove that, for a wide range of the input parameters, this\ndynamics converges within $O({md}(\\bar {\\mathbf {c}}) \\log {n})$ rounds.

The Somorjai group in Nano. Lett. {\\bf 9}, 3930\n(2009) has reported a chemicurrent, a flux of charge carriers in response to\n$\\mathrm{H_2}$ oxidation by $\\mathrm{O_2}$ into $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ over a platinum\nsurface. The nature of the chemicurrent has been debated in the literature;\nexplanations both extrinsic and intrinsic to the reaction mechanism have been\noffered. This article suggests a picture behind the chemicurrent experiments,\nwhich is intrinsic to the mechanism of hydrogen oxidation in a high temperature\nregime. Surface reaction intermediates, $\"\\mathrm{O^-}\"$, $\"\\mathrm{H^-}\"$,\n$\"\\mathrm{OH^-}\"$, are negatively charged while the product, $\\mathrm{H_2O}$,\nand reactants, $\\mathrm{H_2}$ and $\\mathrm{O_2}$, are neutral. Hence, charge\ntransfers between the metal and reacting species are inevitable. After\nelectrons are transferred from the metal to the interface in dissociative\noxygen and hydrogen adsorption, translationally excited electrons in the metal\narise in part as a result of decay of negatively charged transition states in\nreaction steps connecting surface species of different charges,\n$\"\\mathrm{O^-+H^-}\" \\rightleftarrows \"\\mathrm{2 e+OH^-}\"$ and\n$\"\\mathrm{OH^-+H^-}\"\\rightleftarrows \"\\mathrm{2 e+H_2O}\"$. These transition\nstates are the lowest energy configurations possible for changing the charge of\nthe negatively charged surface intermediates. In particular, the transition\nstate for $\"\\mathrm{O^-+H^-}\" \\rightleftarrows \\mathrm{\"2 e+OH^-\"}$ limits the\nreaction rate. These processes may contribute to the chemicurrent. This picture\nshould also apply to other catalytic chemical reactions on metal surfaces that\nproceed through formation of charged surface intermediates and their consequent\ndischarge into the metal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 17:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 22:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-14"}

GRBs are rare in the universe, and their progenitor stars are thought to\npossess unique physical properties such as low metal content and rapid\nrotation, while the supernovae (SNe) that are associated with GRBs are expected\nto be highly aspherical. To date, it has been unclear whether GRB-SNe could be\nused as standardizable candles, with contrasting conclusions found by different\nteams. In this paper I present evidence that GRB-SNe have the potential to be\nused as standardizable candles, and show that a statistically significant\nrelation exists between the brightness and width of their decomposed light\ncurves relative to a template supernova. Every single nearby spectroscopically\nidentified GRB-SN, for which the rest-frame and host contributions have been\naccurately determined, follows this relation. Additionally, it is shown that\nnot only GRB-SNe, but perhaps all supernovae whose explosion is powered by a\ncentral engine, may eventually be used as a standardizable candle.

Since similarity is not guaranteed,\nsampling and reconstruction are adjusted during acquisition to match the actual\nsimilarity between the scans. The baseline MR scan is utilized both in the\nsampling stage, via adaptive sampling, and in the reconstruction stage, with\nweighted reconstruction.

Moreover, the rate of the stellar mass input from mergers also\nlies below that of an in-situ star formation (SF) rate. The fraction of stellar\nmasses in galaxies contributed by mergers in overdense regions is ~12%, and\n~33% in the normal regions, at these redshifts. Our median SF rates for ~few X\n10^9 Mo galaxies agrees well with the recently estimated rates for z ~ 7\ngalaxies from Spitzer's SURF-UP survey. Finally, we find that the main\ndifference between the normal and overdense regions lies in the amplified\ngrowth of massive galaxies in massive dark matter halos. This leads to the\nformation of >= 10^{10} Mo galaxies due to the ~100-fold increase in mass\nduring the above time period. Such galaxies are basically absent in the normal\nregions at these redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 20:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In contrast, irregular moons have\nhighly inclined (and even retrograde), typically eccentric and long period\norbits around their host planet. Irregular moons are therefore often thought to\nbe unbound objects in helio-centric orbits that were later captured to their\ncurrent orbits around the planet. Here we study the a different possibility in\nwhich regular moons form in-situ, and dynamically evolve through mutual\nmoon-moon scattering.

Two possible explanations for these observations hold up best\nto close scrutiny - tidal interaction with AS 205 S or disk winds (or a\ncombination of the two), and we discuss these possibilities in some detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Jul 2014 23:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This gap in the sample\ncomplexity was then further studied in several followup papers, showing that\n(at least in some cases) this gap is unavoidable.

In this paper,\nwe focus on reducing the sizes of inputs to SDP solvers to improve the\nefficiency and reliability of those SDP based methods. Two types of\npolynomials, convex cover polynomials and split polynomials, are defined. A\nconvex cover polynomial or a split polynomial can be decomposed into several\nsmaller sub-polynomials such that the original polynomial is SOS if and only if\nthe sub-polynomials are all SOS. Thus the original SOS problem can be\ndecomposed equivalently into smaller sub-problems.

Some necessary conditions for polynomials to be SOS are\nalso given, which can help refute quickly those polynomials which have no SOS\nrepresentations so that SDP solvers are not called in this case.

The mean azimuthal velocity field we obtain shows super-rotation in an\ninner region close to the inner sphere where the Lorentz force dominates, which\ncontrasts with an outer geostrophic region governed by the Coriolis force, but\nwhere the magnetic torque remains the driver. The meridional circulation is\nstrongly hindered by the presence of both the Lorentz and the Coriolis forces.\nNevertheless, it contributes to a significant part of the induced magnetic\nenergy. Our approach sets the scene for evaluating the contribution of velocity\nand magnetic fluctuations to the mean magnetic field, a key question for dynamo\nmechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 06:19:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Nov 2014 07:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

With logic specifications we mean properties expressed as formulae in\nlinear temporal logic or as automata on infinite strings.

Both techniques\nprovide finite symbolic models that are approximately bisimilar to stochastic\nswitched systems under some stability assumptions on the concrete model. This\nallows formally synthesizing controllers (switching signals) that are valid for\nthe concrete system over the finite symbolic model, by means of mature\nautomata-theoretic techniques in the literature.

Theoretical work on fishbone modes states\nthat the fast-ion distribution itself acts as the source of free energy driving\nthe modes that cause the redistribution. Therefore a series of experiments have\nbeen carried out on MAST to investigate a range of plasma density levels at two\nneutral beam power levels to determine the region within this parameter space\nin which MHD activity and consequent fast-ion redistribution is suppressed.\nAnalysis of these experiments shows complete suppression of MHD activity at\nhigh density with increasing activity and fast-ion redistribution at lower\ndensities and higher NB power accompanied by strong evidence for localisation\nof the redistribution effect to a specific region in the plasma core. The\nresults also indicate correlations between the form of the modelled fast-ion\ndistribution function, the amplitude and growth rate of the fishbone modes, and\nthe magnitude of the redistribution effect. The same analysis has been carried\nout on models of MAST-Upgrade baseline plasma scenarios to determine whether\nsignificant fast-ion redistribution is likely to occur in that device.

In this study, we use a kinetic Monte-Carlo\nalgorithm to calculate hysteresis loops, so both time and temperature are\ncorrectly taken into account. It is demonstrated that this algorithm correctly\nreproduces the high-frequency hysteresis loop of both superparamagnetic NPs and\nferromagnetic ones without any ad-hoc parameters. The algorithm is easily\nparallelizable so calculation on several processors decreases considerably\ncalculation time. The specific absorption rate (SAR) of NPs dispersed inside\nspherical lysosomes is studied as a function of several key parameters: volume\nconcentration, applied magnetic field, lysosome size, NP diameter and\nanisotropy. The influence of these parameters is illustrated and\ncomprehensively explained. In summary, the effect of magnetic interactions is\nto increase the coercive field, saturation field and hysteresis area of major\nloops. However, for small amplitude magnetic field such as the ones used in MH,\nthe heating power as function of concentration can increase, decrease or\ndisplay a bell shape, depending of the relationship between the applied\nmagnetic field and the coercive/saturation fields of the NPs. The hysteresis\narea is found to be well correlated to the parallel or antiparallel nature of\nthe dipolar field acting on each NP.

For the wide-cylinder\ncase, we also observe a \"whale\" effect, where the intruder follows the\nconvective current and does not stay at the surface. We show that the\nnon-dimensional critical conditions for the BNE agree well with previous\nstudies. We also show that the BNE is scalable for low-gravity environments and\nthat the rise speed of an intruder is proportional to the square root of the\ngravitational acceleration.

For this reason,\nthis study is only valid when the cosmological contribution is considered\nirrelevant. The action functional of the model involves two functions $f^1(R)$\nand $f^2(R)$ of the Ricci scalar curvature $R$, where the last one multiplies\nthe matter Lagrangian.\n  Using a Taylor expansion around $R=0$ for both functions $f^1(R)$ and\n$f^2(R)$, it was found that the metric around a spherical object is a\nperturbation of the weak-field Schwarzschild metric. The $tt$ component of the\nmetric, a Newtonian plus a Yukawa perturbation term, is constrained using the\navailable observational results.\n  First it is shown that this effect is null when the characteristic mass\nscales of each function $f^1(R)$ and $f^2(R)$ are identical. Besides, the\nconclusion is that the nonminimal coupling only affects the Yukawa contribution\nstrength and not its range and that the Starobinsky model for inflation is not\nexperimentally constrained. Moreover, the geodetic precession effect, obtained\nalso from the radial perturbation of the metric, reveals to be of no relevance\nfor the constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 10:51:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-11"}

The maximum total flux density of 135000 Jy is\nobserved in 2012 June while it is still one order of magnitude lower than those\nin previous bursts.

They are elongated along a\nnorthwest-southeast direction perpendicular to the low-velocity outflow driven\nby Source I. Proper motions of the supermaser features with respect to Source I\nare measured toward west and southwest directions, almost parallel to the\nlow-velocity outflow.

In particular, the\nerror-correcting capabilities of such quantum codes are verified in\ngraph-theoretic terms as originally advocated by Schlingemann and Werner.\nFinally, possible generalizations of our scheme for the graphical construction\nof both (stabilizer and nonadditive) nonbinary and continuous-variable quantum\ncodes are briefly addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 13:18:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-11"}

(This was noted\nearlier, by Bramson.) This means that, when gravitational radiation is present,\nasymptotically covariantly constant vector fields do not exist. On the other\nhand, according to the Bondi-Sachs construction, a weaker class of\nasymptotically constant vectors does exist. Reconciling these concepts leads to\na measure of the scattering of matter by gravitational waves, that is, bulk\nexchanges of energy-momentum between the waves and matter. Because these bulk\neffects are potentially larger than the tidal ones which have usually been\nstudied, they may affect the waves' propagation more significantly, and the\nquestion of matter's transparency to gravitational radiation should be\nrevisited. While in many cases there is reason to think the waves will be only\nslightly affected, some situations are identified in which the energy-momentum\nexchanges can be substantial enough that a closer investigation should be made.\nIn particular, the work here suggests that gravitational waves produced when\nrelativistic jets are formed might be substantially affected by passing through\nan inhomogeneous medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 14:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The\nelectronic contribution is resolved using its dependence on a transverse\nmagnetic field. At high frequencies, we study the attenuation of an\nelectromagnetic wave in a coplanar waveguide. To quantitatively calibrate these\ndata, we use the fact that in the quantum-Hall-effect regime the conductance at\nthe maxima of its magnetic field dependence is determined by extended states.\nTherefore, it should be frequency independent in a broad frequency domain. The\nprocedure is verified by studies of a well-characterized $p$-SiGe/Ge/SiGe\nheterostructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 15:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In this model, a group of\nidentical tokens are initially placed at nodes of the graph. Each node\nmaintains a cyclic ordering of the outgoing arcs, and during consecutive turns\nthe tokens are propagated along arcs chosen according to this ordering in\nround-robin fashion. The behavior of the model is fully deterministic. Yanovski\net al.(2003) proved that a single rotor-router walk on any graph with m edges\nand diameter $D$ stabilizes to a traversal of an Eulerian circuit on the set of\nall 2m directed arcs on the edge set of the graph, and that such periodic\nbehaviour of the system is achieved after an initial transient phase of at most\n2mD steps. The case of multiple parallel rotor-routers was studied\nexperimentally, leading Yanovski et al. to the conjecture that a system of $k\n\\textgreater{} 1$ parallel walks also stabilizes with a period of length at\nmost $2m$ steps. In this work we disprove this conjecture, showing that the\nperiod of parallel rotor-router walks can in fact, be superpolynomial in the\nsize of graph. On the positive side, we provide a characterization of the\nperiodic behavior of parallel router walks, in terms of a structural property\nof stable states called a subcycle decomposition. This property provides us the\ntools to efficiently detect whether a given system configuration corresponds to\nthe transient or to the limit behavior of the system. Moreover, we provide\npolynomial upper bounds of $O(m^4 D^2 + mD \\log k)$ and $O(m^5 k^2)$ on the\nnumber of steps it takes for the system to stabilize. Thus, we are able to\npredict any future behavior of the system using an algorithm that takes\npolynomial time and space. In addition, we show that there exists a separation\nbetween the stabilization time of the single-walk and multiple-walk\nrotor-router systems, and that for some graphs the latter can be asymptotically\nlarger even for the case of $k = 2$ walks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 06:12:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Feb 2015 08:03:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 May 2015 06:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-29"}

We split the entire angular or\nfrequency band into uniform bins. The bin size is set such that the received\nspectra at two frequencies or angles, whose distance is equal to or larger than\nthe size of a bin, are uncorrelated. These problems in the two different\ndomains lead to a similar circulant structure in the so-called coset\ncorrelation matrix. This circulant structure allows for a strong compression\nand a simple least-squares reconstruction method. The latter is possible under\nthe full column rank condition of the system matrix, which can be achieved by\ndesigning the spatial or temporal sampling patterns based on a circular sparse\nruler.

The\ntelescope is mounted inside the receiver and cooled to $<\\,4$ K by a\nclosed-cycle $^4$He refrigerator to reduce background loading on the detectors.\nLinearly polarized signals from the sky are modulated with a metal-mesh\nhalf-wave plate that is rotated at the aperture stop of the telescope with a\nhollow-shaft motor based on a superconducting magnetic bearing. The modular\ndetector array design includes at least 2300 LEKIDs, and it can be configured\nfor spectral bands centered on 150~GHz or greater. Our study considered\nconfigurations for observing in spectral bands centered on 150, 210 and\n267~GHz. The entire polarimeter is mounted on a commercial precision rotary air\nbearing, which allows fast azimuth scan speeds with negligible vibration and\nmechanical wear over time. A slip ring provides power to the instrument,\nenabling circular scans (360 degrees of continuous rotation). This mount, when\ncombined with sky rotation and the latitude of the observation site, produces a\nhypotrochoid scan pattern, which yields excellent cross-linking and enables\n34\\% of the sky to be observed using a range of constant elevation scans. This\nscan pattern and sky coverage combined with the beam size (15~arcmin at\n150~GHz) makes the instrument sensitive to $5 < \\ell < 1000$ in the angular\npower spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 14:04:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2014 14:49:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 16:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}
