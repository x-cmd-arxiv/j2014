First, the presented trading\nstrategy appears very lucrative in the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) framework. In\nfact, it is such even to the extent that the BSM model turns out to be, in a\nsense, incompatible with the CAPM. Second, if one wishes to adapt these models\ntogether, then the adjustment of the consistent pricing rule (i.e. modifying\nstate price densities) inevitably leads to some form of volatility smile and\nthis is the main point of the paper. Moreover, these observations arise from\npurely structural considerations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 16:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

An interesting corollary is that the time-space\ntradeoff for quantum attacks is very different from what classical attacks\nallow.

We employ the so-called quantum Markovian semi-group\nevolution, i.e. a general form of time-autonomous positivity and\ntrace-preserving dynamical equation for reduced density operators, by only\nallowing unitarity-breaking dissipative terms acting at the boundaries of a\nsystem. Such setup enables to simulate macroscopic reservoirs for different\nvalues of effective thermodynamic potentials, causing incoherent transitions\nbetween quantum states which are modeled with aid of the Lindblad operators.\nThis serves as a simple minimalistic model for studying quantum transport\nproperties, either in the linear response domain or in more general regimes far\nfrom canonical equilibrium. We are mainly exploring possibilities of\nidentifying nonequilibrium situations which are amenable to exact description\nwithin matrix product state representation, by exclusively focusing on steady\nstates, i.e. fixed points of the Lindblad equation, of certain prototypic\ninteracting integrable spin chains driven by incoherent polarizing processes.\nFinally, we define a concept of pseudo-local extensive almost-conserved\nquantities by allowing a violation of time-invariance up to boundary-localized\nterms. We elucidate the role of such quantities on non-ergodic behaviour of\ntemporal correlation functions rendering anomalous transport properties. It\nturns out that such conservation laws can be generated by means of boundary\nuniversal quantum transfer operators of the fundamental integrable models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 16:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

The discovery of now extinct $^{10}$Be in calcium-aluminum-rich\ninclusions (CAIs) with Fractionation and Unidentified Nuclear isotope anomalies\n(FUN-CAIs) suggests that a baseline concentration of $^{10}$Be in the early\nsolar system was inherited from the protosolar molecular cloud. In this paper,\nwe first show that the $^{10}$Be recorded in FUN-CAIs cannot have been produced\nin situ by cosmic-ray (CR) irradiation of the FUN-CAIs themselves. We then show\nthat trapping of Galactic CRs (GCRs) in the collapsing presolar cloud core\ninduced a negligible $^{10}$Be contamination of the protosolar nebula.\nIrradiation of the presolar molecular cloud by background GCRs produced a\nsteady-state $^{10}$Be/$^9$Be ratio ~2.3 times lower than the ratio recorded in\nFUN-CAIs, which suggests that the presolar cloud was irradiated by an\nadditional source of CRs. Considering a detailed model for CR acceleration in a\nsupernova remnant (SNR), we find that the $^{10}$Be abundance recorded in\nFUN-CAIs can be explained within two alternative scenarios: (i) the irradiation\nof a giant molecular cloud by CRs produced by >50 supernovae exploding in a\nsuperbubble of hot gas generated by a large star cluster of at least 20,000\nmembers and (ii) the irradiation of the presolar molecular cloud by freshly\naccelerated CRs escaped from an isolated SNR at the end of the Sedov-Taylor\nphase.

Our main focus is how\nfluctuations impact patterns when they are weakly coupled to an external\nstimulus or another equivalent pattern. Showing the generality of our approach,\nwe study both propagating fronts and stationary bumps. Using a separation of\ntime scales, we represent the effects of noise in terms of a phase-shift of a\npattern from its uniformly translating position at long time scales, and\nfluctuations in the pattern profile around its instantaneous position at short\ntime scales. In the case of a stimulus-locked front, we show that the\nphase-shift satisfies a nonlinear Langevin equation (SDE) whose deterministic\npart has a unique stable fixed point. Using a linear-noise approximation, we\nthus establish that wandering of the front about the stimulus-locked state is\ngiven by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Analogous results hold for the\nrelative phase-shift between a pair of mutually coupled fronts, provided that\nthe coupling is excitatory. On the other hand, if the mutual coupling is given\nby a Mexican hat function (difference of exponentials), then the linear-noise\napproximation breaks down due to the co-existence of stable and unstable\nphase-locked states in the deterministic limit. Similarly, the stochastic\nmotion of mutually coupled bumps can be described by a system of nonlinearly\ncoupled SDEs, which can be linearized to yield a multivariate OU process. As in\nthe case of fronts, large deviations can cause bumps to temporarily decouple,\nleading to a phase-slip in the bump positions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 17:49:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 03:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-08"}

In\norder to validate the prescription based on these quantities, we study the\ndegree of correlation between \"the reference quantities\" and the \"actual degree\nof deviation between the interpolating function and the true function\" in\nexamples where the true functions are known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 18:28:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 12:50:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 May 2015 13:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-18"}

However, stationarity is rarely a realistic assumption.\nAlternative methods which more appropriately model the nonstationarity present\nin environmental processes often involve high-dimensional parameter spaces,\nwhich lead to difficulties in model fitting and interpretability.

The entanglement entropy can be\noperationalized as the entanglement cost necessary to transmit the state of the\nsubregion from one party to another while preserving all correlations with a\nreference party. The question then arises as to whether the lengths of other\nbulk curves can be interpreted as entanglement costs for some other information\ntheoretic tasks. Building on recent results showing that the length of more\ngeneral bulk curves is computed by the differential entropy, we introduce a new\ntask called constrained state merging, whereby the state of the boundary\nsubregion must be transmitted using operations restricted in location and scale\nin a way determined by the geometry of the bulk curve. Our main result is that\nthe cost to transmit the state of a subregion under the conditions of\nconstrained state merging is given by the differential entropy and hence the\nsigned length of the corresponding bulk curve. When the cost is negative,\nconstrained state merging distills entanglement rather than consuming it. This\ndemonstration has two parts: first, we exhibit a protocol whose cost is the\nlength of the curve and second, we prove that this protocol is optimal in that\nit uses the minimum amount of entanglement. In order to complete the proof, we\nadditionally demonstrate that single-shot smooth conditional entropies for\nintervals in 1+1-dimensional conformal field theories with large central charge\nare well approximated by their von Neumann counterparts.

These sudden changes\ncan alter the electromagnetic emission across the jet and potentially help\ndistinguish mergers of black holes in AGNs from single accreting black holes\nbased on jet morphology alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 20:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 18:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-04"}

A total of 53 ULXs\nwere detected and we confirm that this is a complete catalogue of ULXs for the\nLIRG sample. We examine the evolution of ULX spectra with luminosity by\nstacking the spectra of individual objects in three luminosity bins, finding a\ndistinct change in spectral index at luminosity ~2 *10^39 erg s^-1. This may be\na change in spectrum as 10 M_sun black holes transit from a ~Eddington to a\nsuper-Eddington accretion regime, and is supported by a plausible detection of\npartially-ionised absorption imprinted on the spectrum of the luminous ULX (L_X\n~5*10^39 erg s^-1) CXOU J024238.9-000055 in NGC 1068, consistent with the\nhighly ionised massive wind that we would expect to see driven by a\nsuper-Eddington accretion flow. This sample shows a large deficit in the number\nof ULXs detected per unit SFR (0.2 ULXs M_sun^-1 yr^-1). This deficit also\nmanifests itself as a lower differential X-ray luminosity function\nnormalisation for the LIRG sample than for samples of other star forming\ngalaxies. We show that it is unlikely that this deficit is a purely\nobservational effect. Part of this deficit might be attributable to the high\nmetallicity of the LIRGs impeding the production efficiency of ULXs and/or a\nlag between the star formation starting and the production of ULXs; however, we\nargue that the evidence -- including very low N_ULX/L_FIR, and an even lower\nULX incidence in the central regions of the LIRGs -- shows that the main\nculprit for this deficit is likely to be the high column of gas and dust in\nthese galaxies, that fuels the high SFR but also acts to obscure many ULXs from\nour view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 21:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The current\nview of the formation of morphogen gradients is that it is a result of complex\nreaction-diffusion processes that include the strongly localized production,\ndiffusion and uniform degradation of signaling molecules. However, multiple\nexperimental studies also suggest that the production of morphogen in many\ncases is delocalized.

For a number of species a reference genome is not available\nso the analyses of targeted sequencing data, for example polymorphic structural\nvariation caused by mobile elements is difficult; clustering methods are\npreferred for such data analysis. Clustering of reads requires a clustering\nthreshold parameter, which is used to compare and group reads. However,\ndetermining the optimal clustering threshold for a read dataset is challenging\nbecause of different sequence composition, the number of sequences present, and\nalso the amount of sequencing errors in the dataset. High values of the\nclustering threshold parameter can falsely inflate the number of recovered\ngenomic regions, while low values of clustering threshold can merge reads from\ndistinct regions into a single cluster. Thus, an algorithm that can empirically\ndetermine clustering threshold is needed. We propose a pipeline for clustering\ngenomic sequences wherein the clustering threshold is empirically determined\nfrom the NGS data. The optimal threshold is decided based on two internal\nclustering measures which assess clusters for small intra-cluster diameters and\nlarge inter-cluster distances. We evaluate the pipeline on two simulated\ndatasets derived from human genome sequence simulating different genomic\nregions and sequencing depth. The total number of clusters obtained from our\npipeline is closer to the actual number of reference sequences when compared to\nsingle round of clustering. Also, the number of clusters whose consensus\nsequence matches a corresponding reference sequence is higher in our pipeline.\nWe observe that the presence of repeat regions affects clustering accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 03:50:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 17:32:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2016 18:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

The limiting distribution can be computed by\nMonte-Carlo simulation. The test defined in this way has been called Weighted\nKolmogorov Smirnov (WKS) test. The fact that the evaluation of the asymptotic\ndistribution serves for many different gene sets results in shorter computing\ntimes. Using expression data from the GEO repository, tested against the MSig\nDatabase C2, a comparison between the classical GSEA test and the new procedure\nhas been conducted. Our conclusion is that, beyond its mathematical and\nalgorithmic advantages, the WKS test could be more informative in many cases,\nthan the classical GSEA test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 05:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

We revisit this issue using the\nSuzaku X-ray data from PDS 456, an AGN with the most powerful UFO seen in the\nlocal Universe. We explore conditions in the wind by developing a new 3-D\nMonte-Carlo code for radiation transport. The code only handles highly ionised\nions, but the data show the ionisation state of the wind is high enough that\nthis is appropriate, and this restriction makes it fast enough to explore\nparameter space. We reproduce the results of earlier work, confirming that the\nmass loss rate in the wind is around 30% of the inferred inflow rate through\nthe outer disc. We show for the first time that UV line driving is likely to be\na major contribution to the wind acceleration. The mass loss rate in the wind\nmatches that predicted from a purely line driven system, and this UV absorption\ncan take place out of the line of sight. Continuum driving should also play a\nrole as the source is close to Eddington. This predicts that the most extreme\noutflows will be produced from the highest mass accretion rate flows onto high\nmass black holes, as observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 08:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We analyze the expanding\nuser-generated content in Sina Weibo, the largest micro-blog site in China, and\nfind evidence that popular messages often follow a mechanism that differs from\nthat found in the spread of disease, in contrast to common believe. In this\nmechanism, an individual with more friends needs more repeated exposures to\nspread further the information. Moreover, our data suggest that in contrast to\nepidemics, for certain messages the chance of an individual to share the\nmessage is proportional to the fraction of its neighbours who shared it with\nhim/her. Thus the greater the number of friends an individual has the greater\nthe number of repeated contacts needed to spread the message, which is a result\nof competition for attention. We model this process using a fractional\nsusceptible infected recovered (FSIR) model, where the infection probability of\na node is proportional to its fraction of infected neighbors. Our findings have\ndramatic implications for information contagion. For example, using the FSIR\nmodel we find that real-world social networks have a finite epidemic threshold.\nThis is in contrast to the zero threshold that conventional wisdom derives from\ndisease epidemic models. This means that when individuals are overloaded with\nexcess information feeds, the information either reaches out the population if\nit is above the critical epidemic threshold, or it would never be well\nreceived, leading to only a handful of information contents that can be widely\nspread throughout the population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 10:33:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 10:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-14"}

But if the incoming direction is\naveraged over the duration of an event then, in contrast with the observations\nby Munk et al. (1963), the sources inferred by great-circle backtracking are\nmost often in good agreement with the location of large storms on weather maps\nof the Southern Ocean. However there are a few puzzling failures of\ngreat-circle backtracking e.g., in one case, the direct great-circle route is\nblocked by the Tuamoto Islands and the inferred source falls on New Zealand.\nMirages like this occur more frequently in the bottom-pressure observations of\nMunk et al. (1963), where several inferred sources fell on the Antarctic\ncontinent.\n  Using spherical ray tracing we investigate the hypothesis that the refraction\nof waves by surface currents produces the mirages. With reconstructions of\nsurface currents inferred from satellite altimetry, we show that mesoscale\nvorticity significantly deflects swell away from great-circle propagation so\nthat the source and receiver are connected by a bundle of many rays, none of\nwhich precisely follow a great circle. The $\\pm 10^\\circ$ directional\nfluctuations at the receiver result from the arrival of wave packets that have\ntravelled along the different rays within this multipath. The occasional\nfailure of great-circle backtracking, and the associated mirages, probably\nresults from partial topographic obstruction of the multipath, which biases the\ndirectional average at the receiver.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 11:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

The model evolves from the main\nsequence up to the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB). Intermediate mass stars are\nimportant because they contribute significantly via the slow neutron capture\nnucleosynthesis. The aim of this work is to gain insight on the behaviour of\nthe AGB star during thermal pulsation. This investigation is based on an\nextended numerical simulation of the evolutionary phases and full, consistent\nAGB model calculations. In particular, the convective structure during\npulsation will be studied, giving particular emphasis to the analysis of the\nstability of the Schwarzschild boundary that will eventually determine the\noccurrence of Third Dredge Up (hereafter referred to as TDUP). We provide a\nbrief description of our updated evolutionary code and focus primarily on the\nobtaining the TDUP after 14 thermal pulses.

Current quantum optical\nexperiments approach system sizes and levels of complexity which require the\ndevelopment of efficient techniques to assess spectral and dynamical features\nwith scalable experimental overhead. However, established methods from optical\nspectroscopy of macroscopic ensembles cannot be applied straightforwardly to\nfew-atom systems. Based on the ideas proposed in [M. Gessner et al. New J.\nPhys. 16 092001 (2014)], we develop a diagrammatic approach to construct\nnonlinear measurement protocols for controlled quantum systems and discuss\nexperimental implementations with trapped ion technology in detail. These\nmethods in combination with distinct features of ultra-cold matter systems\nallow us to monitor and analyze excitation dynamics in both the electronic and\nvibrational degrees of freedom. They are independent of system size, and can\ntherefore reliably probe systems where, e.g., quantum state tomography becomes\nprohibitively expensive. We propose signals that can probe steady state\ncurrents, detect the influence of anharmonicities on phonon transport, and\nidentify signatures of chaotic dynamics near a quantum phase transition in an\nIsing-type spin chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 11:43:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

When the azimuthal component of the magnetic\nfield is purely rotational and the axial component is nonzero, a new kind of\nelectromagnetic instability emerges.

This paper only contains announcements and a few\nsketches of proofs; a forthcoming series of papers will present the proofs in\ndetails.\n  The two prototypical examples of non-hyperbolic dynamics are homoclinic\ntangencies and heterodimensional cycles. Palis conjectured that they actually\ncharacterize densely non-hyperbolic dynamics. It is therefore important to\nunderstand what happens close to those bifurcations. We generalize classical\nresults of Newhouse, Palis and Viana, for both tangencies and cycles: close to\na homoclinic tangency or to a heterodimensional cycle there is abundance of\ndiffeomorphisms exhibiting infinitely many sinks or sources if and only if the\ndynamics is not volume-hyperbolic. This proves in particular a conjecture of\nTuraev for homoclinic tangencies.\n  An important result of Bonatti, Diaz, Pujals states that if a homoclinic\nclass is $C^1$-robustly without dominated splitting, then nearby\ndiffeomorphisms exhibit $C^1$-generically infinitely many sinks or sources. We\nshow that this holds in higher regularities, under the further assumption that\nnon-dominations are obtained through so-called \"mechanisms\". This includes all\nthe examples of robustly non-dominated homoclinic classes one can build with\nthe tools known up to now.

In order to\nlook for poles, this effective potential is used as the kernel of the\nBethe-Salpeter equation. As a result, for the $B\\bar{B}^*$ interaction we find\na loosely bound state with mass in the range $10587-10601$ MeV, very close to\nthe experimental value of the $Z_b(10610)$ reported by Belle Collaboration. For\nthe $B^*\\bar{B}^*$ case, we find a cusp at $10650$ MeV for all spin\n$J=0,\\,1,\\,2$ cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 15:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-16"}

We provide theoretical justification to the intuition\nthat high degree nodes pose a challenge to network controllability.

Accordingly, while a directed star topology can never be made\ncontrollable for all sizes by injecting an input just at a fraction $f<1$ of\nnodes; for path or cycle networks, the designer can actuate a non-zero fraction\nof nodes and spread them throughout the network in such way that the least\neigenvalue of the Gramians remain bounded away from zero with the increasing\nsize.

Those locomotor\ncharacteristics might be the result of the neurological/musculoskeletal\ndegenerative processes typical of advanced age or of a decline that began\nearlier in life. In order to help determine between the two possibilities, we\nanalyzed the relationship between age and gait features among 100 individuals\naged 20-69. Trunk acceleration was measured during 5-min treadmill session\nusing a 3D accelerometer. The following dependent variables were assessed:\npreferred walking speed, walk ratio (step length normalized by step frequency),\ngait instability (local dynamic stability, Lyapunov exponent method), and\nacceleration variability (root mean square (RMS)). Using age as a predictor,\nlinear regressions were performed for each dependent variable. The results\nindicated that walking speed, walk ratio and trunk acceleration variability\nwere not dependent on age (R2<2%). However, there was a significant quadratic\nassociation between age and gait instability in the mediolateral direction\n(R2=15%). We concluded that most of the typical gait features of older age do\nnot result from a slow evolution over the life course.

Two\nnon-interacting cell lines were grown in the same culture, and counts of each\nspecies were recorded at periodic times. The relative growth of population\nratios was found to depend on the initial proportion, in contradiction with the\ntraditional exponential growth model. The proposed explanation is the\nvariability of growth rates for clones inside the same cell line. This leads to\na log-quadratic growth model that provides both a theoretical explanation to\nthe phenomenon that was observed, and a better fit to our growth data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 05:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-04"}

This paradigm is\ncharacterized by using annotations as multifunctional carriers and making them\nportable. The testing grounds we have chosen are two significant enterprises,\none in the history of science, and one in Hebrew scholarship. The first one\n(CKCC) focuses on the results of a project where a Dutch consortium of\nuniversities, research institutes, and cultural heritage institutions\nexperimented for 4 years with language techniques and topic modeling methods\nwith the aim to analyze the emergence of scholarly debates. The data: a complex\nset of about 20.000 letters. The second one (DTHB) is a multi-year effort to\nexpress the linguistic features of the Hebrew bible in a text database, which\nis still growing in detail and sophistication. Versions of this database are\npackaged in commercial bible study software. We state that the results of these\nforms of scholarship require new knowledge management and archive practices.\nOnly when researchers can build efficiently on each other's (intermediate)\nresults, they can achieve the aggregations of quality data by which new\nquestions can be answered, and hidden patterns visualized. Archives are\nrequired to find a balance between preserving authoritative versions of sources\nand supporting collaborative efforts in digital scholarship. Annotations are\npromising vehicles for preserving and reusing research results.

In this paper we discuss how HDI sits at the intersection of\nvarious disciplines, including computer science, statistics, sociology,\npsychology and behavioural economics. We expose the challenges that HDI raises,\norganised into three core themes of legibility, agency and negotiability, and\nwe present the HDI agenda to open up a dialogue amongst interested parties in\nthe personal and big data ecosystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 19:11:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 07:59:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-07"}
