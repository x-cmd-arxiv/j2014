An approach based on the use of dispersion relations for the flow\nvelocity is developed. It is shown that for an incompressible flow conserving\nvorticity, there exists a decomposition of the velocity field into rotational\nand potential components, such that the restriction of the former to an\narbitrary cross-section of the channel is a functional of the vorticity and\nvelocity distributions over that cross-section, while the latter is\ndivergence-free and bounded downstream thereof. By eliminating the unknown\npotential component with the help of a dispersion relation, a nonlinear\nintegro-differential equation for the flow velocity is obtained. It is then\nanalyzed within an asymptotic expansion in the small ratio v*/U of the friction\nvelocity to the mean flow velocity. Upon statistical averaging in the lowest\nnontrivial order, this equation relates the mean velocity to the\ncross-correlation function of the velocity fluctuations. Analysis of the\nequation reveals existence of two continuous families of solutions, one having\nthe near-wall asymptotic of the form U \\sim ln^p (y/y0), where y is the\ndistance to the wall, p>0 is arbitrary, and the other, U \\sim y^n, with n>0\nalso arbitrary except in the limit n \\to 0 where it turns out to be a universal\nfunction of the Reynolds number, n \\sim 1/ln(Re). It is proved, furthermore,\nthat given a mean velocity distribution having either asymptotic, one can\nalways construct a cross-correlation function so as to satisfy the obtained\nequation.

For a\nmagnetic field solution corresponding to Carrington Rotation (CR) 2029\n(declining phase, April-May 2005), the majority of the CMEs deflected to the\nHeliospheric Current Sheet (HCS), the minimum in magnetic pressure on global\nscales. Most of the deflection occurred below 4 Rs. Here we extend ForeCAT to\ninclude a three dimensional description of the deflecting CME. We attempt to\nanswer the following questions: a) Do all CMEs deflect to the magnetic minimum?\nand b) Does most deflection occur within the first few solar radii (~4 Rs)?\nResults for solar minimum and declining phase CMEs show that not every CME\ndeflects to the magnetic minimum and that the deflection is typically\ndetermined below 2 Rs. Slow, wide, low mass CMEs in declining phase solar\nbackgrounds with strong magnetic field and magnetic gradients exhibit the\nlargest deflections. Local gradients related to active regions tend to cause\nthe largest deviations from the deflection predicted by global magnetic\ngradients, but variations can also be seen for CMEs in the quiet sun regions of\nthe declining phase CR.

This\nstrategy partitions training into two distinct stages. First, in an\nunsupervised manner, we learn a set of generic dictionaries optimized for\nsparse coding of image patches. We train a multilayer representation via\nrecursive sparse dictionary learning on pooled codes output by earlier layers.\nSecond, we encode all training images with the generic dictionaries and learn a\ntransfer function that optimizes reconstruction of patches extracted from\nannotated ground-truth given the sparse codes of their corresponding image\npatches. At test time, we encode a novel image using the generic dictionaries\nand then reconstruct using the transfer function. The output reconstruction is\na semantic labeling of the test image.\n  Applying this strategy to the task of contour detection, we demonstrate\nperformance competitive with state-of-the-art systems.

The stochastic optimal control problem\nentails a cost function in terms of expected values and higher moments of the\nstates, and chance constraints that ensure probabilistic constraint\nsatisfaction. The generalized polynomial chaos framework is used to propagate\nthe time-invariant stochastic uncertainties through the nonlinear system\ndynamics, and to efficiently sample from the probability densities of the\nstates to approximate the satisfaction probability of the chance constraints.\nTo increase computational efficiency by avoiding excessive sampling, a\nstatistical analysis is proposed to systematically determine a-priori the least\nconservative constraint tightening required at a given sample size to guarantee\na desired feasibility probability of the sample-approximated chance constraint\noptimization problem. In addition, a method is presented for sample-based\napproximation of the analytic gradients of the chance constraints, which\nincreases the optimization efficiency significantly. The proposed stochastic\nnonlinear model predictive control approach is applicable to a broad class of\nnonlinear systems with the sufficient condition that each term is analytic with\nrespect to the states, and separable with respect to the inputs, states and\nparameters. The closed-loop performance of the proposed approach is evaluated\nusing the Williams-Otto reactor with seven states, and ten uncertain parameters\nand initial conditions. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the approach\nfor real-time stochastic model predictive control and its capability to\nsystematically account for probabilistic uncertainties in contrast to a\nnonlinear model predictive control approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 19:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-17"}

To take this into consideration, we introduce\ncoevolutionary success-driven multigames in structured populations. While the\ncore game is always the weak prisoner's dilemma, players whose payoffs from the\nprevious round exceed a threshold adopt only a minimally low temptation to\ndefect in the next round. Along with the strategies, the perceived strength of\nthe social dilemma thus coevolves with the success of each individual player.\nWe show that the lower the threshold for using the small temptation to defect,\nthe more the evolution of cooperation is promoted. Importantly, the promotion\nof cooperation is not simply due to a lower average temptation to defect, but\nrather due to a dynamically reversed direction of invasion along the interfaces\nthat separate cooperators and defectors on regular networks. Conversely, on\nirregular networks, in the absence of clear invasion fronts, the promotion of\ncooperation is due to intermediate-degree players. At sufficiently low\nthreshold values, these players accelerate the erosion of defectors and\nsignificantly shorten the fixation time towards more cooperative stationary\nstates.

In\naddition, the recent proposal of a direct equivalence between the $p$-type\ndoping typically found for these systems and the spontaneous polarization (SP)\nassociated to the particular SiC polytype, opens the possibility of tuning the\nnumber of carriers in the Dirac cones without the need of external gate\nvoltages. However, first principles calculations which could confirm at the\natomic scale the effect of the SP are lacking mainly due to the difficulty of\ncombining a bulk property such as the SP with the surface confined graphene\ndoping. Here we develop an approach based on standard density functional theory\n(DFT) slab calculations in order to quantify the effect of the SP on the QFG\ndoping level. First, we present an accurate scheme to estimate the SPs by\nexploiting the dependence of the slab's dipole moment with its thickness. Next,\nand in order to circumvent the DFT shortcomings associated to polar slab\ngeometries, a double gold layer is attached at the C-terminated bottom of the\nslab which introduces a metal induced gap state that pins the chemical\npotential inside the gap thus allowing a meaningful comparison of the QFG\ndopings among different polytypes. Furthermore, the slab dipole can be removed\nafter adjusting the Au-Au interlayer distances. Our results confirm that the SP\ndoes indeed induce a substantial p-doping of the Dirac cones which can be as\nlarge as a few hundreds of meV depending on the hexagonality of the polytype.\nThe evolution of the doping with the slab thickness reveals that several tens\nof SiC bilayers are required to effectively remove the depolarization field and\nrecover the macroscopic regime whereby the graphene doping should equal the SP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 19:58:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 17:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}

Previous studies, however, indicated that only jets from extremely\nrare, high power quasars or radio galaxies could impart significant feedback on\ntheir hosts.

We\nargue that the envelopes of these stars, which will form pair-instability\nsupernovae, become pulsationally unstable and that this will lead to extreme\nmass-loss rates despite the tiny metal content of the envelopes. We investigate\nthe pulsational properties of such models and derive pulsationally induced\nmass-loss rates, which take the damping effects of the mass loss on the\npulsations selfconsistently into account. We find that the pulsations may\ninduce mass-loss rates of ~ 1e-4 - 1e-2 Msun/yr shortly before the explosions,\nwhich may create a dense circumstellar medium. Our results show that very\nmassive stars with dense circumstellar media may stem from a wider initial mass\nrange than pulsational-pair instability supernovae. The extreme mass loss will\ncease when so much of the hydrogen-rich envelope is lost that the star becomes\nmore compact and stops pulsating. The helium core of these stars therefore\nremains unaffected, and their fate as pair-instability supernovae remains\nunaltered. The existence of dense circumstellar media around metal-free\npair-instability supernovae can make them brighter and bluer, and they may be\neasier to detect at high redshifts than previously expected. We argue that the\nmass-loss enhancement in pair-instability supernova progenitors can naturally\nexplain some observational properties of superluminous supernovae: the\nenergetic explosions of stars within hydrogen-rich dense circumstellar media\nwith little 56Ni production and the lack of a hydrogen-rich envelope in\npair-instability supernova candidates with large 56Ni production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 21:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}

The\nsame disc masses produce entirely different results for grazing/colliding\nencounters.

These\npopulations represent the two extremes of light-element abundance variations in\nthe cluster. NGC 6752 is a benchmark cluster in the study of multiple stellar\npopulations because of the rich array of spectroscopic abundances and\npanchromatic Hubble Space Telescope photometry. The spectroscopic abundances\nare used to compute stellar atmosphere and evolution models. The synthetic\nspectra for the two populations show significant differences in the ultraviolet\nand, for the coolest temperatures, in the near-infrared. The stellar evolution\nmodels exhibit insignificant differences in the H-R diagram except on the lower\nmain sequence. The appearance of multiple sequences in the colour-magnitude\ndiagrams (CMDs) of NGC 6752 is almost exclusively due to spectral effects\ncaused by the abundance variations. The models reproduce the observed splitting\nand/or broadening of sequences in a range of CMDs. The ultraviolet CMDs are\nsensitive to variations in carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen but the models are not\nreliable enough to directly estimate abundance variations from photometry. On\nthe other hand, the widening of the lower main sequence in the near-infrared\nCMD, driven by oxygen-variation via the water molecule, is well-described by\nthe models and can be used to estimate the range of oxygen present in a cluster\nfrom photometry.

Our analysis contemplates three distinct situations, with\nthe cosmological constant being zero, positive or negative. Using the technique\nof matched asymptotic expansions we compute analytically the greybody factors\nin the low-frequency regime, restricting to s-wave scattering.

The\npossible classical collective motions are determined by different dynamical\ngroups that can be constructed from the symplectic generators. The relation of\nthe $Sp(12,R)$ irreps with the shell-model classification of the basis states\nis considered by extending of the state space to the direct product space of\n$SU_{p}(3) \\otimes SU_{n}(3)$ irreps, generalizing in this way the Elliott's\n$SU(3)$ model for the case of two-component system. The $Sp(12,R)$ model\nappears then as a natural multi-major-shell extension of the generalized\nproton-neutron $SU(3)$ scheme which takes into account the core collective\nexcitations of monopole and quadrupole, as well as dipole type associated with\nthe giant resonance vibrational degrees of freedom. Each $Sp(12,R)$ irreducible\nrepresentation is determined by a symplectic bandhead or an intrinsic $U(6)$\nspace which can be fixed by the underlying proton-neutron shell-model\nstructure, so the theory becomes completely compatible with the Pauli\nprinciple. It is shown that this intrinsic $U(6)$ structure is of vital\nimportance for the appearance of the low-lying collective bands with both the\npositive and negative parity. The full range of low-lying collective states can\nthen be described by the microscopically based intrinsic $U(6)$ structure,\nrenormalized by coupling to the giant resonance vibrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 00:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-20"}

As we\ndemonstrate in this paper, all conventional difficulties may, however, be\novercome if the generation of the D-term is based on strong dynamics. To\nillustrate our idea, we focus on a certain class of vector-like SUSY breaking\nmodels that enjoy a minimal particle content and which may be easily embedded\ninto more complete scenarios.

The C+ and C excitation in the diffuse\ngas is consistent with a median pressure of 5900 Kcm-3 for a mean TK ~100 K.\nThe knowledge of the gas density allows us to determine the filling factor of\nthe absorbing gas along the selected lines of sight: the median value is 2.4 %,\nin good agreement with the CNM properties. The mean excitation temperature is\nused to derive the average cooling due to C+ in the Galactic plane : 9.5 x\n10^{-26} erg/s/H. Along the observed lines of sight, the gas phase carbon\nabundance does not exhibit a strong gradient as a function of Galacto-centric\nradius and has a weighted average of C/H = 1.5 +/- 0.4 x 10^{-4}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 08:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-17"}

The effect of cosmic variance is largely reduced by dividing the\ntracer power spectrum by that from a BAO-free simulation starting with the same\nphases. This permits us to study with unprecedented accuracy (better than 0.02%\nfor dark matter and 0.07% for low-bias halos) small shifts of the pristine BAO\nwavenumbers towards larger k, and non-linear damping of BAO wiggles in the\npower spectrum of dark matter and halo populations in the redshift range z=0-1.\nFor dark matter, we provide an accurate parametrization of the evolution of\n\\alpha as a function of the linear growth factor D(z).

The analysis of\nArabic script is further complicated due to obligatory dots/strokes that are\nplaced above or below most letters and usually written delayed in order. Due to\nambiguities and diversities of writing styles, recognition systems are\ngenerally based on a set of possible words called lexicon. When the lexicon is\nsmall, recognition accuracy is more important as the recognition time is\nminimal. On the other hand, recognition speed as well as the accuracy are both\ncritical when handling large lexicons. Arabic is rich in morphology and syntax\nwhich makes its lexicon large. Therefore, a practical online handwriting\nrecognition system should be able to handle a large lexicon with reasonable\nperformance in terms of both accuracy and time. In this paper, we introduce a\nfully-fledged Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based system for Arabic online\nhandwriting recognition that provides solutions for most of the difficulties\ninherent in recognizing the Arabic script. A new preprocessing technique for\nhandling the delayed strokes is introduced. We use advanced modeling techniques\nfor building our recognition system from the training data to provide more\ndetailed representation for the differences between the writing units, minimize\nthe variances between writers in the training data and have a better\nrepresentation for the features space. System results are enhanced using an\nadditional post-processing step with a higher order language model and\ncross-word HMM models. The system performance is evaluated using two different\ndatabases covering small and large lexicons. Our system outperforms the\nstate-of-art systems for the small lexicon database.

It has been conjectured to model low-energy dynamics of vortex\nsolitons in the presence of a Chern-Simons term, the k\\\"ahler manifold in\nquestion being the $n$-vortex moduli space. This paper presents a detailed\nstudy of RMG motion in soliton moduli spaces, focusing on the cases of\nhyperbolic vortices and spherical $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ lumps. It is shown that RMG\nflow localizes on fixed point sets of groups of holomorphic isometries, but\nthat the flow on such submanifolds does not, in general, coincide with their\nintrinsic RMG flow. For planar vortices, it is shown that RMG flow differs from\nan earlier reduced dynamics proposed by Kim and Lee, and that the latter flow\nis ill-defined on the vortex coincidence set. An explicit formula for the\nmetric on the whole moduli space of hyperbolic two-vortices is computed\n(extending an old result of Strachan's), and RMG motion of centred two-vortices\nis studied in detail. Turning to lumps, the moduli space of static $n$-lumps is\n$Rat_n$, the space of degree $n$ rational maps, which is known to be k\\\"ahler\nand geodesically incomplete. It is proved that $Rat_1$ is, somewhat\nsurprisingly, RMG complete (meaning that that the initial value problem for RMG\nmotion has a global solution for all initial data).

One general strategy to improve balance is\nto match a variable number of control units to each treated unit. A more\ntailored strategy is to adopt a fine balance constraint.

Finally, the\ncompression is obtained by entropy coding of the quantized coefficients and the\nbases. Our method has low computational cost and can be easily extended to\ncompress mocap databases.

Two parameters characterize the tidal response of the membrane:\nthe effective Poisson's ratio $\\bar\\nu$ and the membrane spring constant\n$\\Lambda$, the latter being proportional to the crust thickness and effective\nshear modulus.

At room temperature\nthese materials exhibit a pressure driven insulator-to-metal transition with\nresistivity decreasing by up to 7 orders of magnitude over a small pressure\nrange. Thus, the application of only a few GPa's to the piezoresistor (SmX)\nallows the switching device to perform complex logic. Here we study from first\nprinciples the electronic properties of these compounds under uniaxial strain\nand discuss the consequences on carrier transport. The changes in the band\nstructure show that the piezoresistive response is mostly governed by the\nreduction of band gap with strain. Furthermore, it becomes optimal when the\nFermi level is pinned near the localized valence band. The piezoresistive\neffect under uniaxial strain which must be taken into account in thin films and\nother systems with reduced dimensionality is also quantified. Under uniaxial\nstrain we find that the piezoresistive response can be substantially larger\nthan in the isotropic case. Analysis of complex band structure of SmSe yields a\ntunneling length of the order of 1 nm. The results suggest that the conduction\nmechanism governing the piezoresistive effect in bulk, i.e.~thermal promotion\nof electrons, should still be dominant in few-nanometer-thick films.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 14:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Two cases are studied: the\nfirst when the system is free, the second when gradually a trapping potential\nis added. In both cases we first focus on the existence and stability/\ninstability properties of standing waves. Our approach leads to the search of\ncritical points of a constrained functional which is unbounded from below on\nthe constraint. In the free case, by showing that the constrained functional\nhas a so-called {\\it mountain pass geometry}, we prove the existence of\nstanding states with least energy, the ground states, and show that any ground\nstate is orbitally unstable. Moreover, when the system is free, we show that\nsmall data in the energy space scatter in all regimes, stable and unstable. In\nthe second case, if the trapping potential is small, we prove that two\ndifferent kind of standing waves appears: one corresponds to a {\\it topological\nlocal minimizer} of the constrained energy functional and it consists in ground\nstates, the other is again of {\\it mountain pass type} but now corresponds to\nexcited states.

Actually, from the physical point of view, the\nintroduction of the trapping potential stabilizes the system initially\nunstable. Related to this we observe that it also creates a gap in the ground\nstate energy level of the system. In addition when the trapping potential is\nactive the presence of standing waves with arbitrary small norm does not permit\nsmall data scattering.

Unlike previous studies, we need to\nachieve rendezvous in presence of a very powerful adversary, a malicious agent\nthat moves through the network and tries to block the honest agents and\nprevents them from gathering. The malicious agent is assumed to be arbitrarily\nfast, has full knowledge of the network and it cannot be exterminated by the\nhonest agents. On the other hand, the honest agents are assumed to be quite\nweak: They are asynchronous and anonymous, they have only finite memory, they\nhave no prior knowledge of the network and they can communicate with the other\nagents only when they meet at a node. Can the honest agents achieve rendezvous\nstarting from an arbitrary configuration in spite of the malicious agent? We\npresent some necessary conditions for solving rendezvous in spite of the\nmalicious agent in arbitrary networks. We then focus on the ring and mesh\ntopologies and provide algorithms to solve rendezvous. For ring networks, our\nalgorithms solve rendezvous in all feasible instances of the problem, while we\nshow that rendezvous is impossible for an even number of agents in unoriented\nrings. For the oriented mesh networks, we prove that the problem can be solved\nwhen the honest agents initially form a connected configuration without holes\nif and only if they can see which are the occupied nodes within a two-hops\ndistance.

To challenge this issue, we rely in\nthis paper1 on model based active testing. In this paper we propose a framework\nto specify security policies and test their implementation. Our framework makes\nit possible to automatically generate test sequences, in order to validate the\nconformance of a security policy. This framework contains several new methods\nto ease the test case generation. To demonstrate the reliability of our\nframework, we present a Vehicular Networks System as an ongoing case study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 10:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

In this paper, {\\bf Pos}-$S$, the category of\n$S$-posets and $S$-poset maps, is considered. One of the main aims of this\npaper is to draw attention to the notion of weak factorization systems in {\\bf\nPos}-$S.$ We show that if the identity element of $S$ is the bottom element,\nthen $(\\mathcal{C_D}, \\mathcal{E_S})$ is a weak factorization system in {\\bf\nPos}-$S,$ where $\\mathcal{C_D}$ and $\\mathcal{E_S}$ are the class of\ndown-closed embedding $S$-poset maps and the class of all split $S$-poset\nepimorphisms, respectively. Among other things, we use a fibrewise notion of\ncomplete posets in the category {\\bf Pos}-$S/B$ under a particular case where\n$B$ has trivial action. We get a necessary condition for regular injective\nobjects in {\\bf Pos}-$S/B$. Finally, we characterize them under a spacial case,\nwhere $S$ is, a pogroup and conclude $(Emb, Top)$ is a weak factorization\nsystem in {\\bf Pos}-$S$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 14:44:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2015 00:12:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

The method proposed by the\nauthors is used. This method allows to reduce the Cauchy problem for two\nhyperbolic quasilinear PDE's to the Cauchy problem for ODE's. In some respect,\nthis method is analogous to the method of characteristics for two hyperbolic\nequations. The method is effectively applicable in all cases when the explicit\nexpression for the Riemann-Green function of some linear second order PDE,\nresulting from the use of the hodograph method for the original equations, is\nknown. One of the method advantages is the possibility of constructing a\nmulti-valued solutions. Compared with the previous authors paper, in which, in\nparticular, the shallow water equations are studied, here we investigate the\ncase when the Riemann-Green function can be represent as the sum of the terms\neach of them is a product of two multipliers depended on different variables.\nThe numerical results for zonal electrophoresis equations are presented. For\ncomputing the different initial data (periodic, wave packet, the Gaussian\ndistribution) are used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 14:25:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-06"}
