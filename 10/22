Using a simple\nparameterisation scheme, the velocity components of a 30km resolution shallow\nwater ocean model are optimised to have the same climatological mean and\nvariance as that of a less viscous 7.5km resolution model. The 5 day\nlag-covariance is also optimised, leading to a more accurate estimate of the\nhigh resolution response to forcing using the low resolution model.\n  The system considered is an idealised barotropic double gyre that is chaotic\nat both resolutions. Using the optimisation scheme, we find and apply the\nconstant in time, but spatially varying, forcing term that is equal to the time\nintegrated forcing of the sub-mesoscale eddies. A linear stochastic term,\nindependent of the large-scale flow, with no spatial correlation but a\nspatially varying amplitude and time scale is used to represent the transient\neddies. The climatological mean, variance and 5 day lag-covariance of the\nvelocity from a single high resolution integration is used to provide an\noptimisation target. No other high resolution statistics are required.\nAdditional programming effort, for example to build a tangent linear or adjoint\nmodel, is not required either.\n  The focus of this paper is on the optimisation scheme and the accuracy of the\noptimised flow. The method can be applied in future investigations into the\nphysical processes that govern barotropic turbulence and it can perhaps be\napplied to help understand and correct biases in the mean and variance of a\nmore realistic coarse or eddy-permitting ocean model. The method is\ncomplementary to current parameterisations and can be applied at the same time\nwithout modification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 16:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The original Miller twist rule assumes a bullet of\nconstant density, but it also works well for conventional copper (or gilding\nmetal) jacketed lead bullets because the density of copper and lead are\nsufficiently close. However, the original Miller twist rule significantly\nunderestimates the gyroscopic stability of plastic-tipped bullets, because the\ndensity of plastic is much lower than the density of copper and lead. Here, a\nnew amended formula is developed for the gyroscopic stability of plastic-tipped\nbullets by substituting the length of just the metal portion for the total\nlength in the (1 + L2) term of the original Miller twist rule. Part 2 describes\nexperimental testing of this new formula on three plastic-tipped bullets. The\nnew formula is relatively accurate for plastic-tipped bullets whose metal\nportion has nearly uniform density, but underestimates the gyroscopic stability\nof bullets whose core is significantly less dense than the jacket.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 16:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

For\nclassical thermal radiation, the dependence of the above mentioned quantities\non the temperature is well-known mainly due to Planck's work. When near-field\neffects, namely the collective influence of diffraction, interference, and\ntunneling of waves, become important, Planck's theory is no longer valid. Of\nmomentum, energy, and entropy transfer, the role of near-field effects on\nmomentum transfer between two half-spaces separated by a vacuum gap (van der\nWaals pressure in the vacuum gap) was first determined by Lifshitz, using\nRytov's theory of fluctuational electrodynamics in 1956.

But in contrast to other studies,\nwith our assumptions, we show that Jupiter was still feeding from the\ncircumsolar disk and that its principal moons cannot have formed after the\ncomplete photoevaporation of the circumsolar nebula. To counteract the steady\nloss of moons into the planet due to type I migration, we propose that the\nwater ice line around Jupiter and super-Jovian exoplanets acted as a migration\ntrap for moons. Heat transitions, however, cross the disk during the gap\nopening within 10^4 yr, which makes them inefficient as moon traps.

Previous\nefforts have relied on simple halo mass estimates inferred from clustering,\nweak gravitational lensing, or halo occupation distribution modeling. In\npractice, these approaches remain uncertain because AGN, no matter how they are\nidentified, potentially live a wide range of halo masses with an occupation\nfunction whose general shape and normalization are poorly known. In this work,\nwe show that better constraints can be achieved through a rigorous comparison\nof the clustering, lensing, and cross-correlation signals of AGN hosts to a\nfiducial stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) derived for all galaxies. Our\ntechnique exploits the fact that the global SHMR can be measured with much\nhigher accuracy than any statistic derived from AGN samples alone. Using 382\nmoderate luminosity X-ray AGN at z<1 from the COSMOS field, we report the first\nmeasurements of weak gravitational lensing from an X-ray selected sample.\nComparing this signal to predictions from the global SHMR, we find that,\ncontrary to previous results, most X-ray AGN do not live in medium size groups\n---nearly half reside in relatively low mass halos with Mh~10^12.5 Msun. The\nAGN occupation function is well described by the same form derived for all\ngalaxies but with a lower normalization---the fraction of halos with AGN in our\nsample is a few percent. By highlighting the relatively \"normal\" way in which\nmoderate luminosity X-ray AGN hosts occupy halos, our results suggest that the\nenvironmental signature of distinct fueling modes for luminous QSOs compared to\nmoderate luminosity X-ray AGN is less obvious than previously claimed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The abundant differences between the properties of disky and\nelliptical, or star-forming and quiescent, galaxies seem to be characteristic\nof the local Universe; such clear distinctions begin to disintegrate as\nobservations of massive galaxies probe higher redshifts. In this Paper, we\ninvestigate the existence the mass fundamental plane of all massive galaxies\n($\\sigma\\gtrsim$ 100 km/s). This work includes local galaxies (0.05<z<0.07)\nfrom the SDSS, in addition to 31 star-forming and 72 quiescent massive galaxies\nat intermediate redshift (z~0.7) with absorption line kinematics from deep\nKeck-DEIMOS spectra and structural parameters from HST imaging. In two\nparameter scaling relations, star-forming and quiescent galaxies differ\nstructurally and dynamically. However, we show that massive star-forming and\nquiescent galaxies lie on nearly the same mass fundamental plane, or the\nrelationship between stellar mass surface density, stellar velocity dispersion,\nand effective radius. The scatter in this relation (measured about\n$\\log\\sigma$) is low: 0.072 dex (0.055 dex intrinsic) at z~0 and 0.10 dex (0.08\ndex intrinsic) at z~0.7. This three dimensional surface is not unique: virial\nrelations, with or without a dependence on luminosity profile shapes, can\nconnect galaxy structures and stellar dynamics with similar scatter. This\nresult builds on the recent finding that mass fundamental plane has been stable\nfor early-type galaxies since z~2 (Bezanson et al. 2013).

On the other hand, it has been found that there are \"Hall\nequilibria\", i.e., field configurations that are unaffected by Hall drift.\nHere, we address the crucial question of the stability of these equilibria\nthrough axially symmetric (2D) numerical simulations of Hall drift and Ohmic\ndiffusion, with the simplifying assumption of uniform electron density and\nconductivity. We demonstrate the 2D-stability of a purely poloidal equilibrium,\nfor which Ohmic dissipation makes the field evolve towards an attractor state\nthrough adjacent stable configurations, around which damped oscillations occur.\nFor this field, the decay scales with the Ohmic timescale. We also study the\ncase of an unstable equilibrium consisting of both poloidal and toroidal field\ncomponents that are confined within the crust.

In the first part, signal spaces are\ncharacterized in which the classical sampling series uniformly converge, and we\ninvestigate whether adaptive recovery algorithms can yield uniform convergence\nin spaces where non-adaptive sampling series does not. In particular, it is\nshown that the investigation of adaptive signal recovery algorithms needs\ncompletely new analytic tools since the methods used for non-adaptive\nreconstruction procedures, which are based on the celebrated Banach-Steinhaus\ntheorem, are not applicable in the adaptive case. The second part analyzes the\napproximation of the output of stable linear time-invariant (LTI) systems based\non samples of the input signal, and where the input is assumed to belong to the\nPaley-Wiener space of bandlimited functions with absolute integrable Fourier\ntransform. If the samples are acquired by point evaluations of the input signal\nf, then there exist stable LTI systems H such that the approximation process\ndoes not converge to the desired output H(f) even if the oversampling factor is\narbitrarily large. If one allows generalized measurements of the input signal,\nthen the output of every stable LTI system can be uniformly approximated in\nterms of generalized measurements of the input signal. The last section studies\nthe situation where only the amplitudes of the signal samples are known. It is\nshown that one can find specific measurement functionals such that signal\nrecovery of bandlimited signals from amplitude measurement is possible, with an\noverall sampling rate of four times the Nyquist rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 22:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-23"}

While spatial\ntransformation techniques such as location perturbation or generalization have\nbeen studied extensively, most techniques rely on syntactic privacy models\nwithout rigorous privacy guarantee. Many of them only consider static scenarios\nor perturb the location at single timestamps without considering temporal\ncorrelations of a moving user's locations, and hence are vulnerable to various\ninference attacks. While differential privacy has been accepted as a standard\nfor privacy protection, applying differential privacy in location based\napplications presents new challenges, as the protection needs to be enforced on\nthe fly for a single user and needs to incorporate temporal correlations\nbetween a user's locations.\n  In this paper, we propose a systematic solution to preserve location privacy\nwith rigorous privacy guarantee.

Second, we show that the well known\n$\\ell_1$-norm sensitivity fails to capture the geometric sensitivity in\nmultidimensional space and propose a new notion, sensitivity hull, based on\nwhich the error of differential privacy is bounded.

By using a variational many-body wavefunction, based on a suitable\nspinorial structure, we find that the polarization properties of the system are\nindeed controlled by the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and repulsive\ninteraction. In particular, two main effects are found: 1) The Rashba coupling\ndetermines a gradual increase of the degree of polarization beyond the critical\nrepulsive interaction strength, at variance with conventional 2D Stoner\ninstability. 2) The critical interaction strength, above which finite\npolarization is developed, shows a dependence on the Rashba coupling, i.e. it\nis enhanced in case the Rashba coupling exceeds a critical value.

The dynamics are modeled as systems of ordinary differential\nequations describing the traffic flow among a finite number of cells\ninterpreted as links of a directed network. Flows between contiguous cells, in\nparticular at junctions, are determined by merging and splitting rules within\nconstraints imposed by the cells' demand and supply functions as well as by the\ndrivers' turning preferences, while inflows at on-ramps are modeled as\nexogenous and possibly time-varying.\n  First, we analyze stability properties of dynamical transportation networks.\nWe associate to the dynamics a state-dependent dual graph whose connectivity\ndepends on the signs of the derivatives of the inter-cell flows with respect to\nthe densities. Sufficient conditions for the stability of equilibria and\nperiodic solutions are then provided in terms of the connectivity of such dual\ngraph.\n  Then, we consider synthesis of control policies that use a combination of\nturning preferences, speed limits, and ramp metering, in order to optimize\nconvex objectives.

If the control policies\nare restricted to speed limits and ramp metering, then the resulting synthesis\nproblem is still convex for networks where every node is either a merge or a\ndiverge junction, and where the dynamics is monotone.

Recent millimetre observations of transition disks\nreveal radially and azimuthally asymmetric structures, where micron- and\nmillimetre-sized dust particles may not spatially coexist. These properties can\nbe the result of particle trapping and grain growth in pressure bumps\noriginating from the disk interaction with a planetary companion. The multiple\nfeatures observed in some transition disks, such as SR 21, suggest the presence\nof more than one planet. We study the gas and dust distributions of a disk\nhosting two massive planets as function of different disk and dust parameters.\nObservational signatures, such as the spectral energy distribution,\nsub-millimetre, and polarised images are simulated for the various parameters.\nWe confirm that planets can lead to particle trapping, although for a disk with\nhigh viscosity ($\\alpha_{\\rm{turb}}=10^{-2}$), the planet should be more\nmassive than $5 M_{\\rm{Jup}}$ and dust fragmentation should occur with low\nefficiency ($v_{f}\\sim30\\rm{m s}^{-1}$). This will lead to a ring-like feature\nas observed in transition disks in the millimetre. When trapping occurs, we\nfind that a smooth distribution of micron sized grains throughout the disk,\nsometimes observed in scattered light, can only happen if the combination of\nplanet mass and turbulence is such that small grains are not fully filtered\nout. A high disk viscosity ($\\alpha_{\\rm{turb}}=10^{-2}$) ensures a\nreplenishment of the cavity in micron-sized dust, while for lower viscosity\n($\\alpha_{\\rm{turb}}=10^{-3}$), the planet mass is constrained to be less than\n$5 M_{\\rm{Jup}}$. In these cases, the gas distribution is likely to show\nlow-amplitude azimuthal asymmetries caused by disk eccentricity rather than by\nlong-lived vortices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 09:21:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 10:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

Stars that have evolved-off the Main Sequence are crucial in\nexpanding the frontiers of knowledge on exoplanets toward higher stellar\nmasses, and to constrain star-planet interaction mechanisms.

ICE comprises strongly suprathermal emission, which has spectral\npeaks at multiple ion cyclotron harmonic frequencies as evaluated at the outer\nmid-plane edge of tokamak plasmas. The measured intensity of ICE spectral peaks\nscaled linearly with measured fusion reactivity in JET. In other large tokamak\nplasmas, ICE is currently used as an indicator of fast ions physics. The\nexcitation mechanism for ICE is the magnetoacoustic cyclotron instability\n(MCI); in the case of JET and TFTR, the MCI is driven by a set of centrally\nborn fusion products, lying just inside the trapped-passing boundary in\nvelocity space, whose drift orbits make large radial excursions to the outer\nmid-plane edge. Diagnostic exploitation of ICE in future experiments therefore\nrests in part on deep understanding of the MCI, and recent advances in\ncomputational plasma physics have led to substantial recent progress, reviewed\nhere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 10:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-29"}

Nowadays, an increasing\namount of organizational information can be posted online by individuals and\nspread instantly through Twitter.

Mining organizational\ncorrelations is a very challenging task due to the following reasons: a) Data\nin Twitter occurs as large volumes of mixed information. The most relevant\ninformation about organizations is often buried. Thus, the organizational\ncorrelations can be scattered in multiple places, represented by different\nforms; b) Making use of information from Twitter collectively and judiciously\nis difficult because of the multiple representations of organizational\ncorrelations that are extracted.

We show that these\nresults are robust against position disorder of the two quantum emitters within\ntheir respective cavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 11:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-23"}

This paper addresses a fourth\nquestion: Does the muzzle flash of a specific cartridge provide sufficient\nduration and intensity of illumination with visible light to allow observers to\npositively identify a shooter's face? The experiment used two shooters firing a\ntotal of 20 shots from a 22 LR semi-automatic pistol. Shooters fired in\nrandomized order, while eight observers (male US military veterans) attempted\nto identify the shooter for each trial shot. The firing range was mostly\ndarkened with only enough ambient light to safely conduct firing tests at the\ndirection of a range safety officer. There was not enough ambient light to\nidentify the shooter's face. Observers correctly identified the shooter 54% of\nthe time and failed to correctly identify the shooter 46% of the time.\nObservers were unanimous that there was no hint of any visible illumination on\nthe shooter's face provided by the muzzle flash. In cases where the shooter was\ncorrectly identified, observers reported using visual cues such as the\nsillhouette of the shooters' hair and slight differences in arm positions when\nfiring the pistol.

Here we examine the consistency of cluster\ncatalogues selected from the SDSS by applying two independent gravity-based\nmethods using all available spectroscopic redshifts from the DR10 release.\nFirst, we detect a gravitational redshift related signal for 20,119 and 13,128\nclusters with spectroscopic redshifts contained in the GMBCG and redMaPPer\ncatalogues, respectively, at a level of $\\sim - 10$ km s$^{-1}$. This we show\nis consistent with the magnitude expected using the richness-mass relations\nprovided by the literature and after applying recently clarified relativistic\nand flux bias corrections.

The\nmagnitude of this lensing effect is generally consistent with the corresponding\nrichness-mass relations advocated for the surveys. We conclude that all\ncatalogues comprise a high proportion of reliable clusters, and that the GMBCG\nand redMaPPer cluster finder algorithms favor more relaxed clusters with a\nmeaningful gravitational redshift signal, as anticipated by the red-sequence\ncolour selection of the GMBCG and redMaPPer samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 14:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

SEP events during solar cycle 23 are selected which are associated\nwith solar flares originating on the visible hemisphere of the Sun and at least\nof magnitude M1. Taking into account all flares and CMEs that occurred during\nthis period, the probability for the occurrence of an SEP event near Earth is\ndetermined. A strong rise of this probability is observed for increasing flare\nintensities, more western locations, larger CME speeds and halo CMEs. The\ncorrelations between the proton peak flux and these solar parameters are\nderived for a low (>10 MeV) and high (>60 MeV) energy range excluding any flux\nenhancement due to the passage of fast interplanetary shocks. The obtained\ncorrelation coefficients are: 0.55+-0.07 (0.63+-0.06) with flare intensity and\n0.56+-0.08 (0.40+-0.09) with the CME speed for E>10 MeV (E>60 MeV). For both\nenergy ranges, the correlations with flare longitude and CME width are very\nsmall or non-existent. Furthermore, the occurrence probabilities, correlation\ncoefficients and mean peak fluxes are derived in multi-dimensional bins\ncombining the aforementioned solar parameters. The correlation coefficients are\nalso determined in different proton energy channels ranging from 5 to 200 MeV.\nThe results show that the correlation between the proton peak flux and the CME\nspeed decreases with energy, while the correlation with the flare intensity\nshows the opposite behavior.

Remarkably, active turbulence can also arise after\nswitching on activity in a sufficiently soft elastomeric solid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 15:33:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 12:57:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 16:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

This encourages users to connect to the Bitcoin network through\nanonymizers like Tor and motivates development of default Tor functionality for\npopular mobile SPV clients.

The\nevolution of the process can be informally described as follows. Each neuron\nspikes randomly following a point process with rate depending on its membrane\npotential. When a neuron spikes, its membrane potential is immediately reset to\na resting value. Simultaneously, the membrane potential of the neurons which\nare influenced by it receive an additional positive value. Furthermore, between\nconsecutive spikes, the system follows a deterministic motion due both to\nelectrical synapses and the leak current. Electrical synapses push the system\ntowards its average potential, while the leak current attracts the membrane\npotential of each neuron to the resting value.\n  We show that in the absence leakage the process converges exponentially fast\nto an unique invariant measure, whenever the initial configuration is non null.\nMore interesting, when leakage is present, we proved the system stops spiking\nafter a finite amount of time almost surely.

Among them, a class of state-of-the-art\nmethods, named feature-based matrix factorization, formalize the task as an\nextension to matrix factorization by incorporating auxiliary features into the\nmodel. Unfortunately, making those algorithms scale to real world problems is\nchallenging, and simple parallelization strategies fail due to the complex\ncross talking patterns between sub-tasks.

The\nkey recipe of this algorithm is an iterative relaxation of the objective to\nfacilitate parallel updates of parameters, with guaranteed convergence on\nminimizing the original objective function.

A semi-analytic Monte Carlo simulation is carried\nout to understand the cosmic black hole merger histories starting from\nintermediate mass black holes at high redshift as well as the possible\nscientific merits of the mission options considered in probing the light seed\nblack holes and their coevolution with galaxies in early Universe. The study\nindicates that, by choosing the armlength of the interferometer to be three\nmillion kilometers and shifting the sensitivity floor to around one-hundredth\nHz, together with a very moderate improvement on the position noise budget,\nthere are certain mission options capable of exploring light seed, intermediate\nmass black hole binaries at high redshift that are not readily accessible to\neLISA/LISA, and yet the technological requirements seem to within reach in the\nnext few decades for China.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 08:48:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 14:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

For very small particle\nresponse times, the particle deposition velocity reduces to that obtained using\na quasi-steady solution of Smoluchowski's equation and for very large particle\nresponse times, the deposition velocity corresponds to that based on the\ntransition state method (E.

We show that the minimum generalized eigenvalue\n$\\lambda(L_G,L_H)$ of the pair of Laplacians $L_G$ and $L_H$ satisfies $$\n  \\lambda(L_G,L_H) \\geq \\phi(G,H) \\phi(G)/8, $$ where $\\phi(G)$ is the usual\nconductance of $G$. A generalized cut that meets this bound can be obtained\nfrom the generalized eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda(L_G,L_H)$.
