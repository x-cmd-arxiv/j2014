This represents a refinement in the study of systems\nexhibiting incomplete violent relaxation. Within a combinatorial analysis\nsimilar to that of Lynden-Bell, we make use of this association to obtain a\ndistribution function that deviates from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,\nincreasing its slope for high energies. Considering the smallness of the\noccupation numbers for large distances from the center of the system, we apply\na correction to Stirling's approximation which increases the distribution slope\nalso for low energies. The distribution function thus obtained presents some\nresemblance to the \"S\" shape of distributions associated with cuspy density\nprofiles (as compared to the distribution function obtained from the Einasto\nprofile), although it is not quite able to produce sharp cusps. We also argue\nhow the association between mixing level and indistinguishability can provide a\nphysical meaning to the assumption of particle-permutation symmetry in the\nN-particle distribution function, when it is used to derive the one-particle\nVlasov equation, which raises doubts about the validity of this equation during\nviolent relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 16:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Dec 2014 17:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-05"}

Part of this new code is an implementation of a spectral\nmethod for solving the angular Teukolsky equation that, to our knowledge, has\nnot been used before for determining quasinormal modes. We focus our attention\non two main areas. First, we explore the behavior of these quasinormal modes in\nthe extreme limit of Kerr, where the frequency of certain modes approaches\naccumulation points on the real axis. We compare our results with recent\nanalytic predictions of the behavior of these modes near the accumulation\npoints and find good agreement. Second, we explore the behavior of solutions of\nmodes that approach the special frequency $M\\omega=-2i$ in the Schwarzschild\nlimit.

Using physical models based on grain-damage,\na grainsize-feedback mechanism capable of producing plate-like mantle\nconvection, we demonstrate that subduction was possible on the Hadean Earth\n(hereafter referred to as proto-subduction or proto-plate tectonics), that\nproto-subduction differed from modern day plate tectonics, and that it could\ninitiate rapidly. Scaling laws for convection with grain-damage show that,\nthough either higher mantle temperatures or higher surface temperatures lead to\nslower plates, proto-subduction, with plate speeds of $\\approx 1.75$ cm/yr, can\nstill be maintained in the Hadean, even with a CO$_2$ rich primordial\natmosphere. Furthermore, when the mantle potential temperature is high (e.g.\nabove $\\approx 2000$ K), the mode of subduction switches to a \"sluggish\nsubduction\" style, where downwellings are drip-like and plate boundaries are\ndiffuse. Finally, numerical models of post-magma ocean mantle convection\ndemonstrate that proto-plate tectonics likely initiates within $\\sim100$ Myrs\nof magma ocean solidification, consistent with evidence from Hadean zircons.\nAfter the initiation of proto-subduction, non-plate-tectonic \"sluggish\nsubduction\" prevails, giving way to modern style plate tectonics as both the\nmantle interior and climate cool.

We consider\nan axisymmetric rigid near-sphere oscillating in a quiescent fluid along a\ndirection perpendicular to its symmetry axis. The kinematics of oscillations\ncan be either prescribed or can result dynamically from the presence of an\nexternal oscillating velocity field. Steady streaming in the fluid, the\ninertial rectification of the time-periodic oscillating flow, generates steady\nstresses on the particle which, in general, do not average to zero, resulting\nin a finite propulsion speed along the axis of the symmetry of the particle and\nperpendicular to the oscillation direction. Our derivation of the propulsion\nspeed is obtained at leading order in the Reynolds number and the deviation of\nthe shape from that of a sphere. The results of our model are consistent with\nthe experimental measurements, and more generally explains how time periodic\nforcing from an acoustic field can be harnessed to generate autonomous motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 18:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-29"}

A number of solutions have\nbeen proposed in the past few years to protect users location information while\nstill allowing them to enjoy geo-located services.

Finally, we show in\nour study that POIs constitute a quasi-identifier for mobile users and that\nobfuscating them using Geo-Indistinguishability is not sufficient as an\nattacker is able to re-identify at least 63% of them despite a high degree of\nobfuscation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 19:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-29"}

To mitigate vulnerabilities introduced because of the\ncomplexity of customizing SSL code in Android applications, we propose that\ncommon SSL configuration should be specified in the application's package\nmanifest.

With these sensors, apps\ncan gather more information and therefore provide end users with more\nfunctionality. However, these sensors also introduce the potential risk of\nleaking a user's private information because apps can access these sensors\nwithout requiring security permissions. By monitoring a device's motion, a\nmalicious app may be able to infer sensitive information about the owner of the\ndevice. For example, related work has shown that sensitive information entered\nby a user on a device's touchscreen, such as numerical PINs or passwords, can\nbe inferred from accelerometer and gyroscope data.\n  In this paper, we study these motion-based keystroke inference attacks to\ndetermine what information they need to succeed. Based on this study, we\npropose two novel approaches to defend against keystroke inference attacks: 1)\nReducing sensor data accuracy; 2) Random keyboard layout generation. We present\nthe design and the implementation of these two defences on the Android platform\nand show how they significantly reduce the accuracy of keystroke inference\nattacks. We also conduct multiple user studies to evaluate the usability and\nfeasibility of these two defences. Finally, we determine the impact of the\ndefences on apps that have legitimate reasons to access motion sensors and show\nthat the impact is negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 19:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-29"}

While researchers have advocated using virtualization to detect\nand prevent attacks on operating systems (e.g., VM introspection and trusted\nvirtual domains), virtualization is not practical on smartphone systems due to\nthe lack of virtualization support and/or the expense of virtualization.\nCurrent smartphone processors do have hardware support for running a protected\nenvironment, such as the ARM TrustZone extensions, but such hardware does not\ncontrol the operating system operations sufficiently to enable VM\nintrospection.

We implemented a\nproof-of-concept version of SPROBES for the ARM Fast Models emulator,\ndemonstrating that in Linux kernel 2.6.38, only 12 SPROBES are sufficient to\nenforce all five of these invariants.

We find that the deprojected center\nof the ring is offset from the star by 4.76$\\pm$1.6 AU and that the deprojected\neccentricity is 0.06$\\pm$0.02, in general agreement with previous studies. We\nfind that the average width of the ring is 14$^{+3}_{-2}%$, also comparable to\nprevious measurements. Such a narrow ring precludes the existence of\nshepherding planets more massive than \\about 4 \\mj, comparable to hot-start\nplanets we could have detected beyond \\about 60 AU in projected separation.\nCombining our new scattered light data with archival HST/STIS and HST/NICMOS\ndata at \\about 0.5-2 \\microns, along with previously unpublished Spitzer/MIPS\nthermal emission data and all other literature thermal data, we set out to\nconstrain the chemical composition of the dust grains. After testing 19\nindividual root compositions and more than 8,400 unique mixtures of these\ncompositions, we find that good fits to the scattered light alone and thermal\nemission alone are discrepant, suggesting that caution should be exercised if\nfitting to only one or the other. When we fit to both the scattered light and\nthermal emission simultaneously, we find mediocre fits (reduced chi-square\n\\about 2). In general, however, we find that silicates and organics are the\nmost favored, and that water ice is usually not favored. These results suggest\nthat the common constituents of both interstellar dust and solar system comets\nalso may reside around HR 4796A, though improved modeling is necessary to place\nbetter constraints on the exact chemical composition of the dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 19:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

It\nrequires modelling the collapse of the first astrophysical objects (Pop III\nstars, first galaxies) and their interaction with the IGM, while at the same\ntime pushing current observational facilities to their limits. The\nobservational and theoretical progress of the last few years have led to the\nemergence of a coherent picture in which the budget of hydrogen-ionizing\nphotons is dominated by low-mass star-forming galaxies, with little\ncontribution from Pop III stars and quasars. The reionization history of the\nUniverse therefore critically depends on the number density of low-mass\ngalaxies at high redshift. In this work, we explore how changes in the\nstatistical properties of initial density fluctuations affect the formation of\nearly galaxies. Following Habouzit et al. (2014), we run 5 N-body simulations\nwith Gaussian and (scale-dependent) non-Gaussian initial conditions, all\nconsistent with Planck constraints. By appealing to a galaxy formation model\nand to a population synthesis code, we compute the far-UV galaxy luminosity\nfunction down to M_UV = -14 at redshift 7 < z < 15. We find that models with\nstrong primordial non-Gaussianities on < Mpc scales show a far-UV luminosity\nfunction significantly enhanced in low-mass galaxies. We adopt a reionization\nmodel calibrated from state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations and show that\nsuch non-Gaussianities leave a clear imprint on the Universe reionization\nhistory and electron Thomson scattering optical depth tau_E. Although current\nuncertainties in the physics of reionization and on the determination of tau_E\nstill dominate the signatures of non-Gaussianities, our results suggest that\ntau_E could ultimately be used to constrain the statistical properties of\ninitial density fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The\nclassic unheated and unperturbed cooling flow model predicts dramatic cooling\nrates and an isobaric X-ray spectrum with constant differential luminosity\ndistribution.

Using 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we show that such\ndeficit arises from the tight self-regulation between thermal instability\ncondensation and AGN outflow injection: condensing clouds boost the AGN\noutflows, which quench cooling as they thermalize through the core. The\nresultant average distribution slope is $\\alpha \\simeq 2$, oscillating within\nthe observed $1<\\alpha<3$.

AGN outflows deposit their energy inside-out,\nreleasing more heat in the inner cooler phase; radially distributed heating\nalone induces a declining spectrum, $1<\\alpha<2$. Turbulence further steepens\nthe spectrum and increases the scatter: the turbulent Mach number in the hot\nphase is subsonic, while it becomes transonic in the cooler phase, making\nperturbations to depart from the isobaric mode.

In this paper, we show that measurements of positions and\ntime delays of strongly lensed images of a background galaxy, as well as those\nof the velocity dispersion and mass profile of a lens galaxy, can be combined\nto extract the angular diameter distance of the lens galaxy. Physically, as the\nvelocity dispersion and the time delay give a gravitational potential ($GM/r$)\nand a mass ($GM$) of the lens, respectively, dividing them gives a physical\nsize ($r$) of the lens. Comparing the physical size with the image positions of\na lensed galaxy gives the angular diameter distance to the lens. A mismatch\nbetween the exact locations at which these measurements are made can be\ncorrected by measuring a local slope of the mass profile. We expand on the\noriginal idea put forward by Paraficz and Hjorth, who analyzed singular\nisothermal lenses, by allowing for an arbitrary slope of a power-law spherical\nmass density profile, an external convergence, and an anisotropic velocity\ndispersion. We find that the effect of external convergence cancels out when\ndividing the time delays and velocity dispersion measurements. We derive a\nformula for the uncertainty in the angular diameter distance in terms of the\nuncertainties in the observables. As an application, we use two existing strong\nlens systems, B1608+656 ($z_{\\rm L}=0.6304$) and RXJ1131$-$1231 ($z_{\\rm\nL}=0.295$), to show that the uncertainty in the inferred angular diameter\ndistances is dominated by that in the velocity dispersion, $\\sigma^2$, and its\nanisotropy. We find that the current data on these systems should yield about\n16% uncertainty in $D_A$ per object. This improves to 13% when we measure\n$\\sigma^2$ at the so-called sweet-spot radius.

If the\nmajority of the detected events are characterized by super-Eddington\nluminosities (such as disk winds, or synchrotron radiation from an off-axis\nrelativistic jet), then the measured SMBH mass distribution will tightly\nconstrain the low-end SMBH occupation fraction.

Finally we discuss\nthe ramifications of our result on the dimensional deconstruction paradigm,\nwhich would seek an equivalence between such theories and a truncated\nKaluza-Klein theory, and find that the impediment to taking the continuum limit\ndue to a low strong-coupling scale is exacerbated by the presence of the ghost,\nwhen these theories are constructed using metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 12:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-07"}

Analysis of the tens of thousands of\nfragmentation spectra produced by a typical shotgun proteomics experiment\nbegins by assigning to each observed spectrum the peptide hypothesized to be\nresponsible for generating the spectrum, typically done by searching each\nspectrum against a database of peptides.

To\nour knowledge, all existing shotgun proteomics search engines compute\nindependent scores between a given observed spectrum and each possible\ncandidate peptide from the database. The key idea of the word lattice is to\nrepresent the set of candidate peptides in a single data structure, thereby\nallowing sharing of redundant computations among the different candidates.

With the recent proliferation of time domain\nsurveys, it is increasingly essential to develop methods to quantify and\nanalyze aperiodic variability. We develop three timescale metrics that have\nbeen little used in astronomy -- {\\Delta}m-{\\Delta}t plots, peak-finding, and\nGaussian process regression -- and present simulations comparing their\neffectiveness across a range of aperiodic light curve shapes, characteristic\ntimescales, observing cadences, and signal to noise ratios. We find that\nGaussian process regression is easily confused by noise and by irregular\nsampling, even when the model being fit reflects the process underlying the\nlight curve, but that {\\Delta}m-{\\Delta}t plots and peak-finding can coarsely\ncharacterize timescales across a broad region of parameter space. We make\npublic the software we used for our simulations, both in the spirit of open\nresearch and to allow others to carry out analogous simulations for their own\nobserving programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 05:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In the original WT model for four hybridized $sp^3$ orbitals on each\natom along with inter-atom hopping, the band structure can be systematically\nexamined in 3D, where flat (dispersionless) bands exist as well. For examining\nsilicene, here we re-formulate the WT model in terms of the overlapping\nmolecular-orbital (MO) method which enables us to describe flat bands away from\nthe electron-holesymmetric point. The overlapping MO formalism indeed enables\nus to reveal an important difference: while in 3D the dipersive bands with\ncones are sandwiched by doubly-degenerate flat bands, in 2D the dipersive bands\nwith cones are sandwiched by triply-degenerate and non-degenerate (nearly) flat\nbands, which is consistent with the original band calculation by Takeda and\nShiraishi. Thus emerges a picture for why the whole band structure of silicene\ncomprises a pair of dispersive bands with Dirac cones with each of the band\ntouching a nearly flat (narrow) band at $\\Gamma$. We can also recognize that,\nfor band engineering, the bonds perpendicular to the atomic plane are crucial,\nand that a ferromagnetism or structural instabilities are expected if we can\nshift the chemical potential close to the flat bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 06:22:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Jan 2015 01:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-30"}

For fast novae, free-free emission dominates the\nspectrum in optical bands rather than photospheric emission and nova optical\nlight curves follow the universal decline law. Faster novae blow stronger winds\nwith larger mass loss rates. Since the brightness of free-free emission depends\ndirectly on the wind mass loss rate, faster novae show brighter optical maxima.\nIn slower novae, however, we must take into account photospheric emission\nbecause of their lower wind mass loss rates. We calculated three model light\ncurves of free-free emission, photospheric emission, and the sum of them for\nvarious WD masses with various chemical compositions of their envelopes, and\nfitted reasonably with observational data of optical, near-IR (NIR), and UV\nbands. From light curve fittings of the seven novae, we estimated their\nabsolute magnitudes, distances, and WD masses.

In this regard,\nthe use of various entropic functions may give additional capabilities to\nreveal desired correlations. It was already shown that the Bell and\nLeggett-Garg inequalities in terms conditional Tsallis entropies are more\nsensitive in the cases of detection inefficiencies. In this paper, we study\ncapabilities of generalized conditional entropies of the Tsallis type in\nanalyzing the Bell theorem in decoherence scenarios.

However, in many application scenarios, the information obtained\nby playing an arm provides information about the remainder of the arms. Hence,\nin such applications, this informativeness can and should be exploited to\nenable faster convergence to the optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce\nand formalize the Global MAB (GMAB), in which arms are globally informative\nthrough a global parameter, i.e., choosing an arm reveals information about all\nthe arms. We propose a greedy policy for the GMAB which always selects the arm\nwith the highest estimated expected reward, and prove that it achieves bounded\nparameter-dependent regret. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only\nfinitely many times, and after a finite number of initial time steps, the\noptimal arm is selected in all of the remaining time steps with probability\none. In addition, we also study how the informativeness of the arms about each\nother's rewards affects the speed of learning. Specifically, we prove that the\nparameter-free (worst-case) regret is sublinear in time, and decreases with the\ninformativeness of the arms. We also prove a sublinear in time Bayesian risk\nbound for the GMAB which reduces to the well-known Bayesian risk bound for\nlinearly parameterized bandits when the arms are fully informative. GMABs have\napplications ranging from drug and treatment discovery to dynamic pricing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 07:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-30"}

The derived potential, which has an explicit velocity\ndependence, contains the entire relativistic features of corresponding\nspacetime including the frame dragging effect, unlike other prevailing\npseudo-Newtonian potentials (PNPs) for the Kerr metric where such an effect is\neither totally missing or introduced in a ad hoc manner. The particle dynamics\nwith this potential precisely reproduce the GR results within a maximum ~ 10 %\ndeviation in energy for a particle orbiting circularly in the vicinity of a\nrapidly corotating black hole. GR epicyclic frequencies are also well\nreproduced with the potential, though with a relatively higher percentage of\ndeviation.

The proposed RMS can also be applied in the well-known\ndynamic programming (DP) approach for stereo and motion.

The final\neffect is that the flux of CR entering into the cloud is strongly suppressed\nbelow an energy threshold whose value depends on ambient parameters. For the\nfirst time we use the full kinetic theory to describe this problem, coupling\nCRs and Alfv\\'en waves through the streaming instability, and including the\ndamping of the waves due to ion-neutral friction and the CR energy losses due\nto ionization and pion production. Differently from previous approaches, this\nmethod allow us to describe the full CR spectrum and the magnetic turbulence\nspectrum in the transition region between hot interstellar medium and the\ncloud. For the typical size and density of diffuse clouds in the Galaxy, we\nfind that the flux of particles entering the cloud is strongly reduced below\nE~10-100 MeV, while for larger energies the CR spectrum remain unaltered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 11:24:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-30"}

By collectives we mean multi-agent systems\nthat transition from one state to another at discrete moments of time. The\nbehavior of a member of a collective (agent) is called conforming if the\nopinion of this agent at current time moment conforms to the opinion of some\nother agents at the previous time moment. We presume that at each moment of\ntime every agent makes a decision by choosing from the set {0,1} (where\n1-decision corresponds to action and 0-decision corresponds to inaction). In\nour approach we model collective behavior with synchronous Boolean networks. We\npresume that in a network there can be agents that act at every moment of time.\nSuch agents are called instigators. Also there can be agents that never act.\nSuch agents are called loyalists. Agents that are neither instigators nor\nloyalists are called simple agents. We study two combinatorial problems. The\nfirst problem is to find a disposition of instigators that in several time\nmoments transforms a network from a state where a majority of simple agents are\ninactive to a state with a majority of active agents. The second problem is to\nfind a disposition of loyalists that returns the network to a state with a\nmajority of inactive agents. Similar problems are studied for networks in which\nsimple agents demonstrate the contrary to conforming behavior that we call\nanticonforming. We obtained several theoretical results regarding the behavior\nof collectives of agents with conforming or anticonforming behavior. In\ncomputational experiments we solved the described problems for randomly\ngenerated networks with several hundred vertices. We reduced corresponding\ncombinatorial problems to the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) and used\nmodern SAT solvers to solve the instances obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 11:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

However, a much richer population of super Earths suggests that 1)\nthere is no shortage of planetary building-block material, 2) gas giants'\ngrowth barrier is probably associated with whether they can merge into\nsuper-critical cores, and 3) super Earths are probably failed cores which did\nnot attain sufficient mass to initiate efficient accretion of gas before it is\nseverely depleted.

This result is obtained by deriving the marginalized posterior\ndistributions of the reheating parameter for about 200 models taken in\nEncyclopaedia Inflationaris. Weighted by the statistical evidence of each model\nto explain the data, we show that the Planck 2013 measurements induce an\naverage reduction of the posterior-to-prior volume by 40%. Making some\nadditional assumptions on reheating, such as specifying a mean equation of\nstate parameter, or focusing the analysis on peculiar scenarios, can enhance or\nreduce this constraint. Our study also indicates that the Bayesian evidence of\na model can substantially be affected by the reheating properties. The\nprecision of the current CMB data is therefore such that estimating the\nobservational performance of a model now requires to incorporate information\nabout its reheating history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 12:50:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 13:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-08"}

Recent technical and methodological progress in neuroimaging has\nhelped advance our understanding of this important issue, with diffusion\nweighted images providing information about structural connectivity (SC) and\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging shedding light on resting state\nfunctional connectivity (rsFC). However, comparing these two distinct datasets,\neach of which can be encoded into a different complex network, is by no means\ntrivial as pairwise link-to-link comparisons represent a relatively restricted\nperspective and provide only limited information. Thus, we have adopted a more\nintegrative systems approach, exploiting theoretical graph analyses to study\nboth SC and rsFC datasets gathered independently from healthy human subjects.\nThe aim is to find the main architectural traits shared by the structural and\nfunctional networks by paying special attention to their common hierarchical\nmodular organization. This approach allows us to identify a common skeleton\nfrom which a new, optimal, brain partition can be extracted, with modules\nsharing both structure and function. We describe these emerging common\nstructure-function modules (SFMs) in detail. In addition, we compare SFMs with\nthe classical Resting State Networks derived from independent component\nanalysis of rs-fMRI functional activity, as well as with anatomical\nparcellations in the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas and with the Broadmann\npartition, highlighting their similitude and differences.

We performed three-dimensional numerical simulations of supernova\nexplosions, in and near turbulent self-gravitating molecular clouds. In order\nto study the influence of the magnetic field, we performed both hydrodynamical\nand magnetohydrodynamical simulations.

We find that the total amount of momentum that is delivered during\nsupernova explosions typically varies by a factor of about 2, even when the gas\ndensity changes by 3 orders of magnitude. However, the amount of momentum\ndelivered to the dense gas varies by almost a factor of 10 if the supernova\nexplodes within or outside the molecular cloud. The magnetic field has little\ninfluence on the total amount of momentum injected by the supernova explosions\nbut increases the momentum injected into the dense gas.\n  Conclusions. Supernovae that explode inside molecular clouds remove a\nsignificant fraction of the cloud mass. Supernovae that explode outside have a\nlimited influence on the cloud.

Both events are associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs)\nerupting from the same active region (NOAA 11176) beneath a well-observed\nhelmet streamer. We find that the type II emissions in both events ended once\nthe CME/shock fronts passed the white-light streamer tip, which is presumably\nthe magnetic cusp of the streamer. This leads us to conjecture that the closed\nmagnetic arcades of the streamer may play a role in electron acceleration and\ntype II excitation at coronal shocks. To examine such a conjecture, we conduct\na test-particle simulation for electron dynamics within a large-scale\npartially-closed streamer magnetic configuration swept by a coronal shock. We\nfind that the closed field lines play the role of an electron trap, via which\nthe electrons are sent back to the shock front for multiple times, and\ntherefore accelerated to high energies by the shock. Electrons with an initial\nenergy of 300eV can be accelerated to tens of keV concentrating at the loop\napex close to the shock front with a counter-streaming distribution at most\nlocations. These electrons are energetic enough to excite Langmuir waves and\nradio bursts.

In these\nsystems, interactions generally occur after specific delays associated to\ntransport, transmission or integration of information. We investigate here the\nimpact of anti-conformism combined to delays in the emergent dynamics of large\npopulations of mainstreams and hipsters. To this purpose, we introduce a class\nof simple statistical systems of interacting agents composed of (i) mainstreams\nand anti-conformists in the presence of (ii) delays, possibly heterogeneous, in\nthe transmission of information. In this simple model, each agent can be in one\nof two states, and can change state in continuous time with a rate depending on\nthe state of others in the past.

(A summary of this fit can be found in Table 2 in\nthe text.) Two notable features, both generic to FSM, not just specific to the\nfit, are: (i) that a theta-angle of order unity in the instanton term in QCD\nwould translate via rotation into a Kobayashi-Maskawa phase in the CKM matrix\nof about the observed magnitude ($J \\sim 10^{-5}$), (ii) that it would come out\ncorrectly that $m_u<m_d$, despite the fact that $m_t \\gg m_b, m_c \\gg m_s$. Of\nthe 18 quantities fitted, 12 are deemed independent in the usual formulation of\nthe standard model. In fact, the fit gives a total of 17 independent parameters\nof the standard model, but 5 of these have not been measured by experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 15:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

A similarly important, but more\naccessible variant of this notion is that of the Knebusch splitting pattern of\n$\\phi$, which captures the isotropy behaviour of $\\phi$ as one passes over a\ncertain prescribed tower of $k$-overfields. In this paper, we determine all\npossible values of this latter invariant in the case where $\\phi$ is totally\nsingular. This includes an extension of Karpenko's theorem (formerly Hoffmann's\nconjecture) on the possible values of the first Witt index to the totally\nsingular case.
