They are most probably characterized by\na magnetic field strength that is roughly two orders of magnitude lower than\nthat of most of the radio and accreting pulsars. The thermal emission of CCOs\ncan be modeled to obtain constraints on the physical parameters of the star\nsuch as its mass, radius, effective temperature, and chemical composition.\nAims: The CCO in HESS, J1731-347 is one of the brightest objects of this class.\nWe present our analysis of two new XMM-Newton observations of the source which\nincrease the total exposure time of the by a factor of five compared to the\nanalyses presented before. Methods: We use our numerical spectral models for\ncarbon and hydrogen atmospheres to fit the spectrum of the CCO. From our fits,\nwe derive constraints on the physical parameters of the emitting star. We also\nuse the new data to derive new upper limits on pulsations and to confirm the\nabsence of a long-term variability. Results: The analysis shows that atmosphere\nspectral models are clearly preferred by the fit over the blackbody function.\nUnder the assumption that the X-ray emission is uniformly produced by the\nentire star surface, hydrogen atmosphere models lead to uncomfortably large\ndistances of the CCO, above 7-8 kpc. On the other hand, the carbon atmosphere\nmodel formally excludes distances above 5-6 kpc and is compatible with the\nsource located in the Scutum-Crux (3 kpc) or Norma-Cygnus (4.5 kpc) Galactic\nspiral arm. We provide and discuss the corresponding confidence contours in the\nNS mass-radius plane. The measured effective temperature indicates that the NS\nis exceptionally hot for the estimated age of 30 kyr. We discuss possible\ncooling scenarios to explain this property, as well as possible additional\nconstraints on the star mass and radius from cooling theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Oct 2014 16:01:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 09:09:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-17"}

How and where these close-in\nplanets formed is one of the major unanswered questions in planet formation.\nHere we calculate the required disk masses for {\\it in situ} formation of the\n{\\it Kepler} planets.

We show that the maximum width of a planet's\naccretion region in the absence of any migration is $2 v_{esc}/\\Omega$, where\n$v_{esc}$ is the escape velocity of the planet and $\\Omega$ the Keplerian\nfrequency and use it to calculate the required disk masses for {\\it in situ}\nformation with giant impacts.

Now we see that these\nassociations are an intermediate scale in a cascade of hierarchical structures\nthat begins on the ambient Jeans length close to a kiloparsec in size and\ncontinues down to the interiors of clusters, perhaps even to binary and\nmultiple stellar systems. The origin of this structure lies with the dynamical\nnature of cloud and star formation, driven by supersonic turbulence and\ninterstellar gravity. Dynamical star formation is relatively fast compared to\nthe timescale for cosmic accretion, and then the star formation rate keeps up\nwith the accretion rate, leading to a sequence of near-equilibrium states\nduring galaxy formation and evolution. Dynamical star formation also helps to\nexplain the formation of bound clusters, which require a local efficiency that\nexceeds the average by more than an order of magnitude. Efficiency increases\nwith density in a hierarchically structured gas. Cluster formation should vary\nwith environment as the relative degree of cloud self-binding varies, and this\ndepends on the ratio of the interstellar velocity dispersion to the galaxy\nrotation speed. As this ratio increases, galaxies become more clumpy, thicker,\nand have more tightly bound star-forming regions. The formation of old globular\nclusters is understood in this context, with the metal-rich and metal-poor\nglobulars forming in high-mass and low-mass galaxies, respectively, because of\nthe galactic mass-metallicity relation. Metal-rich globulars remain in the\ndisks and bulge regions where they formed, while metal-poor globulars get\ncaptured as parts of satellite galaxies and end up in today's spiral galaxy\nhalos. Blue globulars in the disk could have formed very early when the whole\nMilky Way had a low mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Oct 2014 18:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

Hence, the power consumption in networks\nis strongly related to the number of active network elements, such as\ninterfaces, line cards, base chassis,... The goal thus is to find a routing\nthat minimizes the (weighted) number of active network elements used when\nrouting. In this paper, we consider a simplified architecture where a\nconnection between two routers is represented as a link joining two network\ninterfaces. When a connection is not used, both network interfaces can be\nturned off. Therefore, in order to reduce power consumption, the goal is to\nfind the routing that minimizes the number of used links while satisfying all\nthe demands. We first define formally the problem and we model it as an integer\nlinear program. Then, we prove that this problem is not in APX, that is there\nis no polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm. We propose a\nheuristic algorithm for this problem and we also prove some negative results\nabout basic greedy and probabilistic algorithms. Thus we present a study on\nspecific topologies, such as trees, grids and complete graphs, that provide\nbounds and results useful for real topologies. We then exhibit the gain in\nterms of number of network interfaces (leading to a global reduction of\napproximately 33 MWh for a medium-sized backbone network) for a set of existing\nnetwork topologies: we see that for almost all topologies more than one third\nof the network interfaces can be spared for usual ranges of operation. Finally,\nwe discuss the impact of energy efficient routing on the stretch factor and on\nfault tolerance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Oct 2014 18:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

Recently, we studied molecular communication between two nodes\nformed from synthetic bacteria. Due to high randomness in behavior of bacteria,\nwe used a population of them in each node. The reliability of such\ncommunication systems depends on both the maximum concentration of molecules\nthat a transmitter node is able to produce at the receiver node as well as the\nnumber of bacteria in each nodes. This maximum concentration of molecules falls\nwith distance which makes the communication to the far nodes nearly impossible.\nIn order to alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose to use a\nmolecular relaying node. The relay node can resend the message either by the\ndifferent or the same type of molecules as the original signal from the\ntransmitter. We study two scenarios of relaying. In the first scenario, the\nrelay node simply senses the received concentration and forwards it to the\nreceiver. We show that this sense and forward scenario, depending on the type\nof molecules used for relaying, results in either increasing the range of\nconcentration of molecules at the receiver or increasing the effective number\nof bacteria in the receiver node. For both cases of sense and forward relaying,\nwe obtain the resulting improvement in channel capacity. We conclude that\nmulti-type molecular relaying outperforms the single-type relaying.

The main\nfeature of the method is that it naturally preserves the important Gauss law,\nnamely $\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{B}=0$. In contrast to most existing approaches\nthat eliminate the electrical field variable $\\boldsymbol{E}$ and give a direct\ndiscretization of the magnetic field, our new approach discretizes the electric\nfield $\\boldsymbol{E}$ by N\\'{e}d\\'{e}lec type edge elements for\n$H(\\mathrm{curl})$, while the magnetic field $\\boldsymbol{B}$ by Raviart-Thomas\ntype face elements for $H(\\mathrm{div})$. As a result, the divergence-free\ncondition on the magnetic field holds exactly on the discrete level. For this\nnew finite element method, an energy stability estimate can be naturally\nestablished in an analogous way as in the continuous case. Furthermore,\nwell-posedness is rigorously established in the paper for both the Picard and\nNewton linearization of the fully nonlinear systems by using the Brezzi theory\nfor both the continuous and discrete cases. This well-posedness naturally leads\nto robust (and optimal) preconditioners for the linearized systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Oct 2014 21:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

In general, we can formalize information-theoretic\nsecurity in various ways: some of them can be formalized as stand-alone\nsecurity by extending (or relaxing) Shannon's perfect secrecy or by other ways\nsuch as semantic security; some of them can be done based on composable\nsecurity. Then, a natural question about this is: what is the gap between the\nformalizations? To answer the question, we investigate relationships between\nseveral formalizations of information-theoretic security for symmetric-key\nencryption and key agreement protocols. Specifically, for symmetric-key\nencryption protocols in a general setting including the case where there exist\ndecryption-errors, we deal with the following formalizations of security:\nformalizations extended (or relaxed) from Shannon's perfect secrecy by using\nmutual information and statistical distance; information-theoretic analogues of\nindistinguishability and semantic security by Goldwasser and Micali; and\ncomposable security by Maurer et al. and Canetti. Then, we explicitly show the\nequivalence and non-equivalence between those formalizations. Under the model,\nwe also derive lower bounds on the adversary's (or distinguisher's) advantage\nand the size of secret-keys required under all of the above formalizations.\nAlthough some of them may be already known, we can explicitly derive them all\nat once through our relationships between the formalizations. In addition, we\nbriefly observe impossibility results which easily follow from the lower\nbounds.

Some quantum effects are to expected in the SFG due to its small\ndimensions, which may play an important role in the operation of an ion\nchannel. Here, we examine parameters in a generalized model of HH to see\nwhether any parameter affects the spike generation. Our results indicate that\nthe previously suggested semi-quantum-classical equation proposed by Bernroider\nand Summhammer (BS) agrees strongly with the HH equation under different\nconditions and may even provide a better explanation in some cases. We conclude\nthat the BS model can refine the classical HH model substantially.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Oct 2014 08:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-28"}

It is of interest to examine if the results\nof two or more measurements in the quantum scenario can be perceived from a\nclassical point of view or they still exhibit non-classical features. Clearly,\ncommuting observables can be measured jointly using projective measurements and\ntheir statistical outcomes can be discerned classically. However, such simple\nminded association of compatibility of measurements with commutativity turns\nout to be limited in an extended framework, where the usual notion of sharp\nprojective valued measurements of self adjoint observables gets broadened to\ninclude unsharp measurements of generalized observables constituting positive\noperator valued measures (POVM).

Understanding the factors that may positively or negatively\naffect testing effort will point to possibilities for reducing this effort.\nConsequently there is a significant body of research that has investigated\nrelationships between static code properties and testability. The work reported\nin this paper complements this body of research by providing an empirical\nevaluation of the degree of association between runtime properties and\nclass-level testability in object-oriented (OO) systems. The motivation for the\nuse of dynamic code properties comes from the success of such metrics in\nproviding a more complete insight into the multiple dimensions of software\nquality. In particular, we investigate the potential relationships between the\nruntime characteristics of production code, represented by Dynamic Coupling and\nKey Classes, and internal class-level testability. Testability of a class is\nconsidered here at the level of unit tests and two different measures are used\nto characterise those unit tests. The selected measures relate to test scope\nand structure: one is intended to measure the unit test size, represented by\ntest lines of code, and the other is designed to reflect the intended design,\nrepresented by the number of test cases. In this research we found that Dynamic\nCoupling and Key Classes have significant correlations with class-level\ntestability measures. We therefore suggest that these properties could be used\nas indicators of class-level testability. These results enhance our current\nknowledge and should help researchers in the area to build on previous results\nregarding factors believed to be related to testability and testing. Our\nresults should also benefit practitioners in future class testability planning\nand maintenance activities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Oct 2014 13:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

Before its spin state can be\nchanged in a process of strong interaction, it is directly transferred to the\ntop quark decay products. The top quark spin can be deduced by studying angular\ndistributions of the decay products. The Standard Model predicts the\ntop/anti-top quark ($t\\bar{t}$) pairs to have correlated spins. The degree is\nsensitive to the spin and the production mechanisms of the top quark. Measuring\nthe spin correlation allows to test the predictions. New physics effects can be\nreflected in deviations from the prediction. In this thesis the spin\ncorrelation of $t\\bar{t}$ pairs, produced at a centre-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s} = 7\\,$TeV and reconstructed with the ATLAS detector, is measured. The\ndataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $4.6~\\text{fb}^{-1}$.\n$t\\bar{t}$ pairs are reconstructed in the $\\ell$+jets channel using a kinematic\nlikelihood fit offering the identification of light up- and down-type quarks\nfrom the $t \\rightarrow bW \\rightarrow bq\\bar{q}'$ decay. The spin correlation\nis measured via the distribution of the azimuthal angle $\\Delta\\phi$ between\ntwo top quark spin analyzers in the laboratory frame. It is expressed as the\ndegree of $t\\bar{t}$ spin correlation predicted by the Standard Model,\n$f_{\\text{SM}}$.
