Recently,\ndifferent groups have exploited the ambipolarity of WSe2 to realize\nelectrically tunable PN junctions, demonstrating its potential for digital\nelectronics and solar cell applications. In this Letter, we focus on the\ndifferent photocurrent generation mechanisms in a double-gated WSe2 device by\nmeasuring the photocurrent (and photovoltage) as the local gate voltages are\nvaried independently in combination with above- and below-bandgap illumination.\nThis enables us to distinguish between two main photocurrent generation\nmechanisms: the photovoltaic and photothermoelectric effect. We find that the\ndominant mechanism depends on the defined gate configuration. In the PN and NP\nconfigurations, photocurrent is mainly generated by the photovoltaic effect and\nthe device displays a maximum responsivity of 0.70 mA/W at 532 nm illumination\nand rise and fall times close to 10 ms. Photocurrent generated by the\nphotothermoelectric effect emerges in the PP configuration and is a factor of\ntwo larger than the current generated by the photovoltaic effect (in PN and NP\nconfigurations). This demonstrates that the photothermoelectric effect can play\na significant role in devices based on WSe2 where a region of strong optical\nabsorption, caused by e.g. an asymmetry in flake thickness or optical\nabsorption of the electrodes, generates a sizeable thermal gradient upon\nillumination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 16:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-02"}

Kawarabayashi, Thomas and Wollan recently showed a self-contained proof of\nthis theorem with the following two sets of parameters: (1)\n$f(w,t)=\\Theta(t^{24}(t^2+w))$ with $|A|=O(t^{24})$, and (2)\n$f(w,t)=w^{2^{\\Theta(t^{24})}}$ with $|A|\\leq t-5$. The latter result gives the\nbest possible bound on $|A|$. In this paper we improve their bounds to\n$f(w,t)=\\Theta(t(t+w))$ with $|A|\\leq t-5$. For the special case where the\nmaximum vertex degree in $G$ is bounded by $D$, we show that, if $G$ contains a\nwall of size $\\Omega(Dt(t+w))$, then either $G$ contains a $K_t$-minor, or\nthere is a flat wall of size $w$ in $G$. This setting naturally arises in\nalgorithms for the Edge-Disjoint Paths problem, with $D\\leq 4$. Like the proof\nof Kawarabayashi et al., our proof is self-contained, except for using a\nwell-known theorem on routing pairs of disjoint paths. We also provide\nefficient algorithms that return either a model of the $K_t$-minor, or a vertex\nset $A$ and a flat wall of size $w$ in $G\\setminus A$.\n  We complement our result for the low-degree scenario by proving an almost\nmatching lower bound: namely, for all integers $w,t>1$, there is a graph $G$,\ncontaining a wall of size $\\Omega(wt)$, such that the maximum vertex degree in\n$G$ is 5, and $G$ contains no flat wall of size $w$, and no $K_t$-minor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 16:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-02"}

The notion of normal bases was also\ngeneralized from the classic case for Galois fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 16:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-02"}

This prevents harvesting to\nextinction. A known exception can occur if consumer demand causes a declining\nspecies' harvest price to rise faster than costs. This threat may affect rare\nand valuable species, such as large land mammals, sturgeons, and bluefin tunas.\nWe analyze a similar but underappreciated threat, which arises when the\ngeographic area (range) occupied by a species contracts as its abundance\ndeclines. Range contractions maintain the local densities of declining\npopulations, which facilitates harvesting to extinction by preventing abundance\ndeclines from causing harvest costs to rise. Factors causing such range\ncontractions include schooling, herding, or flocking behaviors--which,\nironically, can be predator-avoidance adaptations; patchy environments; habitat\nloss; and climate change. We use a simple model to identify combinations of\nrange contractions and price increases capable of causing extinction from\nprofitable overharvesting, and we compare these to an empirical review. We find\nthat some aquatic species that school or forage in patchy environments\nexperience sufficiently severe range contractions as they decline to allow\nprofitable harvesting to extinction even with little or no price increase; and\nsome high-value declining aquatic species experience severe price increases.\nFor terrestrial species, the data needed to evaluate our theory are scarce, but\navailable evidence suggests that extinction-enabling range contractions may be\ncommon among declining mammals and birds. Thus, factors causing range\ncontraction as abundance declines may pose unexpectedly large extinction risks\nto harvested species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 18:31:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 23:15:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 05:24:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 00:30:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-31"}

It may be that quantum gravity\nrepresents the breakdown of spacetime geometry described by GR. The\nrelationship between quantum gravity and spacetime has been deemed \"emergence\",\nand the aim of this thesis is to investigate and explicate this relation. After\nfinding traditional philosophical accounts of emergence to be inappropriate, I\ndevelop a new conception of emergence by considering physical case studies\nincluding condensed matter physics, hydrodynamics, critical phenomena and\nquantum field theory understood as effective field theory.\n  This new conception of emergence is independent of reduction and derivation.\nInstead, a low-energy theory is understood as emergent from a high-energy\ntheory if it is novel and autonomous compared to the high-energy theory, and\nthe low-energy physics is dependent (in a particular, minimal sense) on the\nhigh-energy physics (this dependence is revealed by the techniques of effective\nfield theory and the renormalisation group). These ideas are important in\nexploring the relationship between quantum gravity and GR, where GR is\nunderstood as an effective, low-energy theory of quantum gravity. Without\nexperimental data or a theory of quantum gravity, we rely on principles and\ntechniques from other areas of physics to guide the way. As well as considering\nthe idea of emergence appropriate to treating GR as an effective field theory,\nI investigate the emergence of spacetime (and other aspects of GR) in several\nconcrete approaches to quantum gravity, including examples of the condensed\nmatter approaches, the \"discrete approaches\" (causal set theory, causal\ndynamical triangulations, quantum causal histories and quantum graphity) and\nloop quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 19:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-02"}

Three fundamental dichotomies are identified in the form of\ndimensionless inequalities. These govern i) the speed of the stream's growth,\nii) its internal coherence, iii) its thickness or opening angles. The\nmechanisms that regulate such main properties are analysed. The slope of the\nhost's density profile influences the speed of the stream's growth, in both\nlength and width, as steeper profiles enhance differential streaming. Internal\ncoherence is the requirement for the appearance of substructure in tidal\ndebris, and I concentrate on the `feathering' typical of GC streams.\nOverdensities are associated with minima in the relative streaming velocity of\nthe stream members. For streams with high circularity, these are caused by the\nepicyclic oscillations of stars; however, for highly non-circular progenitor's\norbits, substructure is caused by the oscillating differences in energy and\nactions with which material is shed at different orbital phases of the\nprogenitor. This modulation results in different streaming speeds: the\nstreakline of material shed between two successive apocentric passages is\nfolded along its length, pulled at its centre by the faster streaming of\nparticles released near pericenter, which are therefore more widely scattered.\nWhen the stream is coherent enough, this mechanism is potentially capable of\ngenerating a bimodal profile in the density distributions of the longer wraps\nof more massive progenitors, which I dub `bifurcations'.

This\npresents challenges to modern accretion and jet theory as upper limits of prior\nBH activity, which we obtain from the radio afterglow of this event, imply that\nboth the pre-disruption BH and stellar magnetic fluxes fall many orders of\nmagnitude short of what is required to power the observed X-ray luminosity.

We start with a short review of the\nhistorical milestones on the path of constructing statistical-thermal models\nfor heavy-ion physics. We discovered that Heinz Koppe formulated in 1948 an\nalmost complete recipe for the statistical-thermal models. In 1950, Enrico\nFermi generalized this statistical approach, in which he started with a general\ncross-section formula and inserted into it simplifying assumptions about the\nmatrix element of the interaction process that likely reflects many features of\nthe high-energy reactions dominated by density in the phase space of final\nstates. In 1964, Hagedorn systematically analysed the high-energy phenomena\nusing all tools of statistical physics and introduced the concept of limiting\ntemperature based on the statistical bootstrap model. It turns to be quite\noften that many-particle systems can be studied with the help of\nstatistical-thermal methods. The analysis of yield multiplicities in\nhigh-energy collisions gives an overwhelming evidence for the chemical\nequilibrium in the final state. The strange particles might be an exception, as\nthey are suppressed at lower beam energies. However, their relative yields\nfulfill statistical equilibrium, as well. We review the equilibrium\nstatistical-thermal models for particle production, fluctuations and collective\nflow in heavy-ion experiments. We also review their reproduction of the lattice\nQCD thermodynamics at vanishing and finite chemical potential.

This\nlinear partial differential equation can then be relaxed to a linear\ndifferential inclusion, allowing for relaxed solutions to be generated using\nsum of squares programming.

In such a scenario, if the target is not directly observed by\nneither a certain node nor its local neighbors, this node is naive about the\ntarget. The well-known Kalman Consensus filter (KCF) has been shown to perform\nwell if there exists no naive node in the network. The case in presence of\nnaive nodes has been considered by the generalized KCF (GKCF) and the\nInformation Weighted Consensus filter (ICF) later on. However, all these\nconsensus-embedded filters require some global information such as the maximum\ndegree of the graph, or the total number of the nodes. If these global\ninformation are changing over the time, such as time-varying topologies or\nunexpected sensor failures in the network, the performance of the GKCF or the\nICF might be degraded. With communication topology changes, node failures, or\naddition of new nodes, the filter performance would be adversely affected. In\nthis paper, we consider a novel local Weighted Least Square estimator for each\nnode that utilizes its generalized measurement formed by not only its own and\nlocal neighbors' measurements but their prior local estimates to track the\ntarget. With some approximations in the derivation of the covariance matrix, we\npropose the Information-driven Fully Distributed Kalman filter (IFDKF), which\nis able to deal with the existence of naive nodes without knowing any global\ninformation.

The bound is\ncomputable in $O(n\\log n+m)$ time steps for weighted graphs with $n$ vertices\nand $m$ edges. In the branch-and-bound setting, the bound for each new\nsubproblem can be updated in $O(n+(m/n)\\log n)$ time steps amortized over a\nseries of $n$ branching steps; a rarely triggered tightening of the bound\nrequires search on the graph of unassigned vertices and can take from $O(n+m)$\nto $O(nm+n^2\\log n)$ steps depending on implementation and possible bound\nquality. Representing a subproblem uses $O(n)$ space. Although the bound is\nweak, we believe that it can be advantageous in a parallel setting to be able\nto generate many subproblems fast, possibly out-weighting the advantages of\ntighter, but much more expensive (algebraic, spectral, flow) lower bounds.\n  We use a recent priority task-scheduling framework for giving a parallel\nimplementation, and show the relative improvements in bound quality and\nsolution speed by the different contributions of the lower bound.

It captures more\ninformation than K-theory but is often more delicate to handle. We\nsystematically study the lattice and category theoretic aspects of Cuntz\nsemigroups.\n  Given a C*-algebra $A$, its (concrete) Cuntz semigroup $Cu(A)$ is an object\nin the category $Cu$ of (abstract) Cuntz semigroups, as introduced by Coward,\nElliott and Ivanescu. To clarify the distinction between concrete and abstract\nCuntz semigroups, we will call the latter $Cu$-semigroups.\n  We establish the existence of tensor products in the category $Cu$ and study\nthe basic properties of this construction. We show that $Cu$ is a symmetric,\nmonoidal category and relate $Cu(A\\otimes B)$ with $Cu(A)\\otimes_{Cu}Cu(B)$ for\ncertain classes of C*-algebras.\n  As a main tool for our approach we introduce the category $W$ of\npre-completed Cuntz semigroups. We show that $Cu$ is a full, reflective\nsubcategory of $W$. One can then easily deduce properties of $Cu$ from\nrespective properties of $W$, e.g. the existence of tensor products and\ninductive limits. The advantage is that constructions in $W$ are much easier\nsince the objects are purely algebraic.\n  We also develop a theory of $Cu$-semirings and their semimodules. The Cuntz\nsemigroup of a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra has a natural product giving\nit the structure of a $Cu$-semiring. We give explicit characterizations of\n$Cu$-semimodules over such $Cu$-semirings. For instance, we show that a\n$Cu$-semigroup $S$ tensorially absorbs the $Cu$-semiring of the Jiang-Su\nalgebra if and only if $S$ is almost unperforated and almost divisible, thus\nestablishing a semigroup version of the Toms-Winter conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 08:41:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 16:18:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2015 13:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-26"}

Bright\nafterglows are produced when the outflow collides with the ambient medium.\nAfterglow polarization directly probes the magnetic properties of the jet, when\nmeasured minutes after the burst, and the geometric properties of the jet and\nthe ambient medium when measured hours to days after the burst. High values of\noptical polarization detected minutes after burst in GRB 120308A indicate the\npresence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields originating from the central\nengine (the power source of the GRB). Theoretical models predict low degrees of\nlinear polarization and negligable circular polarization at late times, when\nthe energy in the original ejecta is quickly transferred to the ambient medium\nand propagates farther into the medium as a blastwave.

A lower bound on the Bayes risk not only serves as a lower\nbound on the minimax risk, but also characterizes the fundamental limit of any\nestimator given the prior knowledge. Our bounds are based on the notion of\n$f$-informativity, which is a function of the underlying class of probability\nmeasures and the prior. Application of our bounds requires upper bounds on the\n$f$-informativity, thus we derive new upper bounds on $f$-informativity which\noften lead to tight Bayes risk lower bounds. Our technique leads to\ngeneralizations of a variety of classical minimax bounds (e.g., generalized\nFano's inequality). Our Bayes risk lower bounds can be directly applied to\nseveral concrete estimation problems, including Gaussian location models,\ngeneralized linear models, and principal component analysis for spiked\ncovariance models. To further demonstrate the applications of our Bayes risk\nlower bounds to machine learning problems, we present two new theoretical\nresults: (1) a precise characterization of the minimax risk of learning\nspherical Gaussian mixture models under the smoothed analysis framework, and\n(2) lower bounds for the Bayes risk under a natural prior for both the\nprediction and estimation errors for high-dimensional sparse linear regression\nunder an improper learning setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 10:26:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 21:45:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 01:46:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 11:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-26"}

A 2nd-order sensitivity analysis is\nconducted for the linear temporal stability of parallel flows U0 subject to\nsmall-amplitude spanwise-periodic modification e*U1, e<<1. Spanwise-periodic\nmodifications have a quadratic effect on stability, i.e. the 1st-order\neigenvalue variation is zero. A 2nd-order sensitivity operator is computed from\na 1D calculation, allowing one to predict how eigenvalues are affected by any\nU1, without actually solving for modified eigenvalues/eigenmodes. Comparisons\nwith full 2D stability calculations in a plane channel flow and in a mixing\nlayer show excellent agreement. Next, optimisation is performed on the\n2nd-order sensitivity operator: for each eigenmode streamwise wavenumber and\nbase flow modification spanwise wavenumber b, the most stabilising profiles U1\nare computed, together with lower bounds for the variation in leading\neigenvalue. These bounds increase like b^-2 as b goes to 0, yielding a large\nstabilising potential. However, 3D modes with wavenumbers |b0|=b and b/2 are\ndestabilised, thus larger control wavenumbers should be preferred. The\nmodification U1 optimised for the most unstable streamwise wavenumber has a\nstabilising effect on other streamwise wavenumbers too. Finally, the potential\nof transient growth to amplify perturbations and stabilise the flow is\nassessed. Combined optimal perturbations that achieve the best balance between\ntransient linear amplification and flow stabilisation are determined. In the\nmixing layer with b<1.5, these combined optimal perturbations appear similar to\ntransient growth-only optimal perturbations, and achieve a more efficient\noverall stabilisation than optimal 1D and 2D modifications computed for\nstabilisation only. This is consistent with the efficiency of streak-based\ncontrol strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 11:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 13:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

The\nlatter is analysed by means of the Kuo-Eliassen equation.\n  The atmospheric heat transport compensates the imposed oceanic heat transport\nchanges to a large extent in conjunction with significant modification of the\ngeneral circulation. Up to a maximum about 3PW, an increase of the oceanic heat\ntransport leads to an increase of the global mean near surface temperature and\na decrease of its equator-to-pole gradient. For larger transports, the gradient\nis reduced further but the global mean remains approximately constant. This is\nlinked to a cooling and a reversal of the temperature gradient in the tropics.\n  A larger oceanic heat transport leads to a reduction of all reservoirs and\nconversions of the Lorenz energy cycle but of different relative magnitude for\nthe individual components. The available potential energy of the zonal mean\nflow and its conversion to eddy available potential energy are affected most.\n  Both Hadley and Ferrel cell show a decline for increasing oceanic heat\ntransport with the Hadley cell being more sensitive. Both cells exhibit a\npoleward shift of their maxima, and the Hadley cell broadens for larger oceanic\ntransports. The partitioning by means of the Kuo-Eliassen equation reveals that\nzonal mean diabatic heating and friction are the most important sources for\nchanges of the Hadley cell while the behaviour of the Ferrell cell is mostly\ncontrolled by friction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 14:27:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

The choice of the\nlink function plays a key role for the interpretation of the model, and our\napproach is especially appealing in terms of interpretation of the effects of\ncovariates on the association of responses.

A pathogen's\nreproductive fitness can be quantified by the basic reproductive number, R0.\nSince pathogen transmission between host plants depends on the spatial\nseparation between them, R0 is strongly influenced by the spatial scales of\npathogen dispersal and the spatial scales of the host population. The basic\nreproductive number was found to increase with the field size at small field\nsizes and to saturate to a constant value at large field sizes. It reaches a\nmaximum in quadratic fields and decreases as the field becomes elongated. This\npattern appears to be quite general: it holds for dispersal kernels that\ndecrease exponentially or faster as well as for \"fat-tailed\" dispersal kernels\nthat decrease slower than exponential (i.e. power-law kernels). We used this\napproach to estimate R0 in wheat stripe rust (an important pathogen caused by\nPuccinia striiformis), since disease gradients for this pathogen were\nthoroughly measured over large distances [Sackett and Mundt, Phytopathology,\n95, 983 (2005)]. For the two largest datasets, we estimated R0 in the limit of\nlarge fields to be of the order of 50. These estimates are consistent with\nindependent field observations [Cowger et al. (2005), Phytopathology, 95,\n97282; Farber et al. (2013), Phytopathology, 103, 41]. We present a proof of\nprinciple of a novel approach to estimate the basic reproductive number, R0, of\nplant pathogens using wheat stripe rust as a case study. We found that the\nspatial extent over which R0 changes strongly is quite fine-scaled (about 30 m\nof the linear extension of the field). Our results indicate that in order to\noptimize the spatial scale of deployment of fungicides or host resistances, the\nadjustments should be made at a fine spatial scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 15:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-03"}

They showed that\nsome NP-complete properties such as Hamiltonicity can be decided in polynomial\ntime on digraphs of constant directed treewidth. Nevertheless, despite more\nthan one decade of intensive research, the list of hard combinatorial problems\nthat are known to be solvable in polynomial time when restricted to digraphs of\nconstant directed treewidth has remained scarce. In this work we enrich this\nlist by providing for the first time an algorithmic metatheorem connecting the\nmonadic second order logic of graphs to directed treewidth. We show that most\nof the known positive algorithmic results for digraphs of constant directed\ntreewidth can be reformulated in terms of our metatheorem. Additionally, we\nshow how to use our metatheorem to provide polynomial time algorithms for two\nclasses of combinatorial problems that have not yet been studied in the context\nof directed width measures. More precisely, for each fixed $k,w \\in\n\\mathbb{N}$, we show how to count in polynomial time on digraphs of directed\ntreewidth $w$, the number of minimum spanning strong subgraphs that are the\nunion of $k$ directed paths, and the number of maximal subgraphs that are the\nunion of $k$ directed paths and satisfy a given minor closed property. To prove\nour metatheorem we devise two technical tools which we believe to be of\nindependent interest. First, we introduce the notion of tree-zig-zag number of\na digraph, a new directed width measure that is at most a constant times\ndirected treewidth. Second, we introduce the notion of $z$-saturated tree slice\nlanguage, a new formalism for the specification and manipulation of infinite\nsets of digraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 15:27:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2015 07:16:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-09"}

Olko and M.P. Waligorski","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"physics.med-ph","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  Radiation therapy with carbon ions is a novel technique of cancer\nradiotherapy, applicable in particular to treating radioresistant tumours at\ndifficult localisations. Therapy planning, where the medical physicist,\nfollowing the medical prescription, finds the optimum distribution of cancer\ncells to be inactivated by their irradiation over the tumour volume, is a basic\nprocedure of cancer radiotherapy. The main difficulty encountered in therapy\nplanning for ion radiotherapy is to correctly account for the enhanced\nradiobiological effectiveness of ions in the Spread Out Bragg Peak (SOBP)\nregion over the tumour volume. In this case, unlike in conventional\nradiotherapy with photon beams, achieving a uniform dose distribution over the\ntumour volume does not imply achieving uniform cancer cell inactivation.\n  In this thesis, an algorithm of the basic element (kernel) of a treatment\nplanning system (TPS) for carbon ion therapy is developed. The algorithm\nconsists of a radiobiological part which suitably corrects for the enhanced\nbiological effect of ion irradiation of cancer cells, and of a physical beam\ntransport model. In the radiobiological component, Katz's track structure model\nof cellular survival is applied, after validating its physical assumptions and\nimproving some aspects of this model. The Katz model offers fast and accurate\npredictions of cell survival in mixed fields of the primary carbon ions and of\ntheir secondary fragments. The physical beam model was based on available\ntabularized data, prepared earlier by Monte Carlo simulations. Both components\nof the developed TPS kernel are combined within an optimization tool, allowing\nthe entrance energy-fluence spectra of the carbon ion beam to be selected in\norder to achieve a pre-assumed uniform (flat) depth-survival profile over the\nSOBP region, assuring uniform cancer cell inactivation over the tumour depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 21:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

We\nshow how this learning algorithm can be used to train probabilistic generative\nmodels by minimizing different discriminative loss functions, such as the\nnegative conditional log-likelihood and the Hinge loss. The resulting models\ntrained by sdEM are always generative (i.e. they define a joint probability\ndistribution) and, in consequence, allows to deal with missing data and latent\nvariables in a principled way either when being learned or when making\npredictions. The performance of this method is illustrated by several text\nclassification problems for which a multinomial naive Bayes and a latent\nDirichlet allocation based classifier are learned using different\ndiscriminative loss functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 12:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}
