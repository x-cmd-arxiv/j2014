By contrast,\nelectrons often form clumpy patterns inside of strongly correlated electronic\nsystems (SCES) such as colossal magnetoresistance materials and high\ntemperature superconductors. In copper-oxide based high temperature\nsuperconductors, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has detected an electron\nnematic on the surface of the material, in which the electrons form nanoscale\nstructures which break the rotational symmetry of the host crystal. These\nstructures may hold the key to unlocking the mystery of high temperature\nsuperconductivity in these materials, but only if the nematic also exists\nthroughout the entire bulk of the material. Using newly developed methods for\ndecoding these surface structures, we find that the nematic indeed persists\nthroughout the bulk of the material. We furthermore find that the intricate\npattern formation is set by a delicate balance among disorder, interactions,\nand material anisotropy, leading to a fractal nature of the cluster pattern.\nThe methods we have developed can be extended to many other surface probes and\nmaterials, enabling surface probes to determine whether surface structures are\nconfined only to the surface, or whether they extend throughout the material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 16:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

The node stores the harvested energy in an energy buffer\nand uses the stored energy to transmit data to the AP in the uplink (UL). We\nconsider a simple transmission policy, which accounts for the fact that in\npractice the EH node may not have knowledge of the EH profile nor of the UL\nchannel state information. In particular, in each time slot, the EH node\ntransmits with either a constant desired power or a lower power if not enough\nenergy is available in its energy buffer. For this simple policy, we use the\ntheory of discrete-time continuous-state Markov chains to analyze the limiting\ndistribution of the stored energy for finite- and infinite-size energy buffers.\nMoreover, we take into account imperfections of the energy buffer and the\ncircuit power consumption of the EH node. For a Rayleigh fading DL channel, we\nprovide the limiting distribution of the energy buffer content in closed form.\nIn addition, we analyze the average error rate and the outage probability of a\nRayleigh faded UL channel and show that the diversity order is not affected by\nthe finite capacity of the energy buffer. Our results reveal that the optimal\ndesired transmit power by the EH node is always less than the average harvested\npower and increases with the capacity of the energy buffer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 16:47:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 20:36:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-10"}

While the importance of\nbiological electron transfer is well-known for individual cells, the past\ndecade has also brought about remarkable discoveries of multi-cellular\nmicrobial communities that transfer electrons between cells and across\ncentimeter length scales, e.g., biofilms and multi-cellular bacterial cables.\nThese experimental observations open up new frontiers in the design of\nelectron-based communications networks in microbial communities, which may\ncoexist with the more well-known communication strategies based on molecular\ndiffusion, while benefiting from a much shorter communication delay.

Although resource augmentation has been\nvery successful in dealing with a variety of objective functions, there are\nproblems for which even a (arbitrary) constant speedup cannot lead to a\nconstant competitive algorithm.

This is useful, for instance, when we consider the objective of\nminimizing the maximum stretch.

When assuming infinite backlog, it is known that\ninter-session network coding (INC) can significantly increase the throughput of\neach flow. However, the corresponding scheduling solution (when assuming\ndynamic arrivals instead and requiring bounded delay) is still nascent.\n  For the 2-flow downlink scenario, we propose the first opportunistic INC +\nscheduling solution that is provably optimal for time-varying channels, i.e.,\nthe corresponding stability region matches the optimal Shannon capacity.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a new binary INC operation, which is\ndistinctly different from the traditional wisdom of XORing two overheard\npackets. We then develop a queue-length-based scheduling scheme, which, with\nthe help of the new INC operation, can robustly and optimally adapt to\ntime-varying channel quality. We then show that the proposed algorithm can be\neasily extended for rate adaptation and it again robustly achieves the optimal\nthroughput. A byproduct of our results is a scheduling scheme for stochastic\nprocessing networks (SPNs) with random departure, which relaxes the assumption\nof deterministic departure in the existing results. The new SPN scheduler could\nthus further broaden the applications of SPN scheduling to other real-world\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 19:07:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

We carried out low resolution\nspectroscopy of the system using the ESO Very Large Telescope equipped with\nFORS1 for ~ 1.5 hours (16 spectra covering the range 430-800 nm). Results: The\npolarimetric analysis performed starting from the TNG dataset revealed a\npolarisation degree in the r-band of 3 % +/- 1 %. From the NOT dataset, due to\nthe lower S/N ratio, we could obtain only a 3 sigma upper limit of 3.4 %. From\nthe joining of a spectroscopic and photometric analysis, through the study of\nthe equivalent width variations of the CII 724 nm line and the r-band light\ncurve, we could find a hint of a ~ 45 min periodicity. Conclusions: A\npolarisation degree P of ~ 3 % in the r-band is consistent with the emission of\na relativistic particle jet, which is supposed to emit intrinsically linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation. Since no variations of P with time have been\ndetected, and the accretion disc of the system does not contain ionised\nhydrogen, scattering by free electrons in the accretion disc has been rejected.\nThe period of ~ 45 min obtained through the analysis of the system light curve\nand of the equivalent width variations of the selected spectral line is\nprobably linked to the presence of a hot spot or a superhump in the accretion\ndisc, and lead to an orbital period > 1 hour for the binary system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

This star has a luminosity of $\\sim$30 $L_{\\odot} $ and is surrounded by\na large ($\\sim$2.6 AU) optically thick dust shell. The differences between the\nL' and Br-$\\gamma$ observations can be understood with a model in which L' and\nBr-$\\gamma$ emission arises primarily from internal and external heating,\nrespectively. We suggest that G2 is a binary star merger product and will\nultimately appear similar to the B-stars that are tightly clustered around the\nblack hole (the so-called S-star cluster).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 20:05:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 22:34:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In\nthe absence of dispersion, this channel behaves as a collection of parallel\nper-sample channels. The conditional probability density function of the\nnonlinear per-sample channels is derived using both a sum-product and a\nFokker-Planck differential equation approach. It is shown that, for a fixed\nnoise power, the per-sample capacity grows unboundedly with input signal. The\nchannel can be partitioned into amplitude and phase subchannels, and it is\nshown that the contribution to the total capacity of the phase channel declines\nfor large input powers. It is found that a two-dimensional distribution with a\nhalf-Gaussian profile on the amplitude and uniform phase provides a lower bound\nfor the zero-dispersion optical fiber channel, which is simple and\nasymptotically capacity-achieving at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). A\nlower bound on the capacity is also derived in the medium-SNR region. The exact\ncapacity subject to peak and average power constraints is numerically\nquantified using dense multiple ring modulation formats. The differential model\nunderlying the zero-dispersion channel is reduced to an algebraic model, which\nis more tractable for digital communication studies, and in particular it\nprovides a relation between the zero-dispersion optical channel and a $2 \\times\n2$ multiple-input multiple-output Rician fading channel. It appears that the\nstructure of the capacity-achieving input distribution resembles that of the\nRician fading channel, i.e., it is discrete in amplitude with a finite number\nof mass points, while continuous and uniform in phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 21:40:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-09"}

It is known that bounding the spectral radius of a random matrix\nconsisting of PC samples, yields a bound on the number of samples necessary to\nidentify coefficients in the PC expansion via solution to a least-squares\nregression problem. We present a related analysis which guarantees a mean\nsquare convergence using a coherence parameter of the sampled PC basis that may\nbe both analytically bounded and computationally estimated. Utilizing\nasymptotic results for orthogonal polynomials, we bound the coherence parameter\nfor polynomials of Hermite and Legendre type under each respective natural\nsampling distribution. In both polynomial bases we identify an importance\nsampling distribution which yields a bound with weaker dependence on the order\nof the PC basis. For more general orthonormal bases, we propose the\ncoherence-optimal sampling: a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, which directly\nuses the basis functions under consideration to achieve a statistical\noptimality among all such sampling schemes with identical support, and which\nguarantees recovery with a number of samples that is, up to logarithmic\nfactors, linear in the number of basis functions considered. We demonstrate\nthese different sampling strategies numerically in both high-order and\nhigh-dimensional manufactured PC expansions. In addition, the quality of each\nsampling method is compared in the identification of solutions to two\ndifferential equations, one with a high-dimensional random input and the other\nwith a high-order PC expansion. In all observed cases the coherence-optimal\nsampling leads to similar or considerably improved accuracy over the other\nconsidered sampling distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 22:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The approach is especially suited for large\nconfiguration spaces that include many invariant constraints, such as those\nfound with whole body humanoid motion planning. Experiences are generated using\nprobabilistic sampling and stored in a sparse roadmap spanner (SPARS), which\nprovides asymptotically near-optimal coverage of the configuration space,\nmaking storing, retrieving, and repairing past experiences very efficient with\nrespect to memory and time. The Thunder framework improves upon past\nexperience-based planners by storing experiences in a graph rather than in\nindividual paths, eliminating redundant information, providing more\nopportunities for path reuse, and providing a theoretical limit to the size of\nthe experience graph. These properties also lead to improved handling of\ndynamically changing environments, reasoning about optimal paths, and reducing\nquery resolution time. The approach is demonstrated on a 30 degrees of freedom\nhumanoid robot and compared with the Lightning framework, an experience-based\nplanner that uses individual paths to store past experiences. In environments\nwith variable obstacles and stability constraints, experiments show that\nThunder is on average an order of magnitude faster than Lightning and planning\nfrom scratch.

The first approach consists\nof learning suitable convolutional network architectures for each domain, while\nthe second approach focuses on learning the weights of the network via\nback-propagation. We consider nine biometric spoofing benchmarks --- each one\ncontaining real and fake samples of a given biometric modality and attack type\n--- and learn deep representations for each benchmark by combining and\ncontrasting the two learning approaches. This strategy not only provides better\ncomprehension of how these approaches interplay, but also creates systems that\nexceed the best known results in eight out of the nine benchmarks. The results\nstrongly indicate that spoofing detection systems based on convolutional\nnetworks can be robust to attacks already known and possibly adapted, with\nlittle effort, to image-based attacks that are yet to come.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 04:42:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 20:11:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2015 21:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

FWI allows for the introduction of measurements of choice and\niteratively improving the background model, while monitoring the evolution of\nthe misfit in all desired categories. Although the misfit is seen to uniformly\nreduce in all categories, convergence to the true model is very slow, possibly\nbecause it is trapped in a local minimum.

In the\npresent formulation, the lack of sufficient temporal frequency and spatial\nresolution makes it difficult to accurately localise flow profiles at depth. We\ntherefore suggest that the most efficient way to discover the global minimum is\nto perform a probabilistic forward search, involving calculating the misfit\nassociated with a broad range of models (generated, for instance, by a\nMonte-Carlo algorithm) and locating the deepest minimum. Such techniques\npossess the added advantage of being able to quantify model uncertainty as well\nas realization noise (data uncertainty).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 04:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We show\nthat turbulent clustering significantly enhances the collision rate for\nparticles of similar sizes with tau_p corresponding to the inertial range of\nthe flow. If the friction time, tau_p,h, of the larger particle is in the\ninertial range, the collision kernel per unit cross section increases with\nincreasing friction time, tau_p,l, of the smaller particle, and reaches the\nmaximum at tau_p,l = tau_p,h, where the clustering effect peaks.

A complex\nscalar field charged under $U(1)_{B-L}$ is introduced to break the $U(1)_{B-L}$\nsymmetry. After $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking a remnant discrete symmetry\nstabilizes the lightest state of the Dirac fermions, which can be a stable dark\nmatter (DM). The second lightest state, if mass splitting with the stable DM is\nabout 3.5 keV, decays dominantly to the stable DM and 3.5 keV photon through\ntwo-loop diagrams, explaining the X-ray line signal. Two-loop suppression of\nthe decay amplitude makes its lifetime much longer than the age of the universe\nand it can be a decaying DM candidate in large parameter region.

Different diagnostics probing different geometrical scales have pointed\ntoward a non-homogeneous mass-loss process: dust clumps are observed at\nmilli-arcsec scale, a bipolar structure is seen at arcsecond-scale and\nmulti-concentric shells are detected beyond 1\". We present the first ALMA Cycle\n0 band 9 data around 650 GHz. The full-resolution data have a spatial\nresolution of 0\".42x0\".24, allowing us to study the morpho-kinematical\nstructure within ~6\". Results: We have detected 25 molecular lines. The\nemission of all but one line is spatially resolved. The dust and molecular\nlines are centered around the continuum peak position. The dust emission has an\nasymmetric distribution with a central peak flux density of ~2 Jy. The\nmolecular emission lines trace different regions in the wind acceleration\nregion and suggest that the wind velocity increases rapidly from about 5 R*\nalmost reaching the terminal velocity at ~11 R*. The channel maps for the\nbrighter lines show a complex structure; specifically for the 13CO J=6-5 line\ndifferent arcs are detected within the first few arcseconds. The curved\nstructure present in the PV map of the 13CO J=6-5 line can be explained by a\nspiral structure in the inner wind, probably induced by a binary companion.\nFrom modeling the ALMA data, we deduce that the potential orbital axis for the\nbinary system lies at a position angle of ~10-20 deg to the North-East and that\nthe spiral structure is seen almost edge-on. We infer an orbital period of 55\nyr and a binary separation of 25 au (or ~8.2 R*). We tentatively estimate that\nthe companion is an unevolved low-mass main-sequence star. The ALMA data hence\nprovide us for the first time with the crucial kinematical link between the\ndust clumps seen at milli-arcsecond scale and the almost concentric arcs seen\nat arcsecond scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 11:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-21"}

It\nnot only introduces prior knowledge to guide unsupervised learning but also\ncancels out partition functions.

This\nzone can be well traced by rotational lines of less abundant CO isotopologues,\nthat probe the gas down to the midplane. The total CO gas mass is then obtained\nwith the isotopologue ratios taken to be constant at the elemental isotope\nvalues found in the local ISM. This approach is however imprecise, because\nisotope selective processes are ignored. The aim of this work is an\nisotopologue selective treatment of CO isotopologues, in order to obtain a more\naccurate determination of disk masses. The isotope-selective photodissociation,\nthe main process controlling the abundances of CO isotopologues in the\nCO-emissive layer, is properly treated for the first time in a full disk model\n(DALI, Bruderer et al. 2012; Bruderer 2013). The chemistry, thermal balance,\nline and continuum radiative transfer are all considered together with a\nchemical network that treats $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, C$^{17}$O, isotopes of all\nincluded atoms, and molecules, as independent species. Isotope selective\nprocesses lead to regions in the disk where the isotopologues abundance ratios\nare considerably different from the elemental ratio. The results of this work\nshow that considering CO isotopologue ratios as constants can lead to an\nunderestimate of disk masses by up to almost two orders of magnitude if grains\nhave grown to larger sizes. This may explain observed discrepancies in mass\ndeterminations from different tracers. The dependence of the various\nisotopologues emission on stellar and disk parameters is investigated.\nIncluding CO isotope selective processes is crucial to determine the gas mass\nof the disk accurately (through ALMA observations) and thus to provide the\namount of gas which may eventually form planets or change the dynamics of\nforming planetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 13:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

A natural mechanism for such\nangle dependent mass enhancement comes from the destruction of the Landau\nquasiparticle at hot spots on the large Fermi surface at a proximate quantum\ncritical point. The possibility of a divergent cyclotron effective mass is\ndiscussed within a scaling theory for such a quantum critical point.

In particular, the c_UBI=(U-B)-(B-I)\npseudo-colour allows us to follow the RGB of both populations along a relevant\nportion of the RGB. We find that the oldest stars have more negative c_UBI\npseudo-colour than intermediate-age ones.

Among the major findings, the final results show that the two novel\nproposals are efficient and, besides, focusing on playback continuity ends up\nbeing the best design concept to achieve high quality of service.

First, systematic scans were performed\nto investigate how the dynamics of a filament are affected by its amplitude,\nperpendicular size and parallel extent. The perpendicular size of the filament\nwas found to have a strong influence on its motions, as it determined the\nrelative importance of parallel currents to polarisation and viscous currents,\nwhilst drift-wave instabilities were observed if the initial amplitude of the\nblob was increased sufficiently.\n  Next, the 3D simulations were compared to 2D simulations using different\nparallel closures; namely, the sheath dissipation closure, which neglects\nparallel gradients, and the vorticity advection closure, which neglects the\ninfluence of parallel currents. The vorticity advection closure was found to\nnot replicate the 3D perpendicular dynamics and overestimated the initial\nradial acceleration of all the filaments studied. In contrast, a more\nsatisfactory comparison with the sheath dissipation closure was obtained, even\nin the presence of significant parallel gradients, where the closure is no\nlonger valid. Specifically it captured the contrasting dynamics of filaments\nwith different perpen- dicular sizes that were observed in the 3D simulations\nwhich the vorticity advection closure failed to replicate. However, neither\nclosure successfully replicated the Boltzmann spinning effects and associated\npoloidal drift of the blob that was observed in the 3D simulations.\n  Although the sheath dissipation closure was concluded to be more successful\nin replicating the 3D dynamics, it is emphasised that the vorticity closure may\nstill be relevant for situations where the parallel current is inhibited from\nclosing through the sheath due to effects such as increased resistivity near\nthe targets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 14:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

They can be very different from the conditional mean functions when\ndistributions are asymmetric and heteroscedastic. How can we efficiently\nestimate the mean regression functions in ultra-high dimensional setting with\nexistence of only the second moment? To solve this problem, we propose a\npenalized Huber loss with diverging parameter to reduce biases created by the\ntraditional Huber loss. Such a penalized robust approximate quadratic\n(RA-quadratic) loss will be called RA-Lasso. In the ultra-high dimensional\nsetting, where the dimensionality can grow exponentially with the sample size,\nour results reveal that the RA-lasso estimator produces a consistent estimator\nat the same rate as the optimal rate under the light-tail situation. We further\nstudy the computational convergence of RA-Lasso and show that the composite\ngradient descent algorithm indeed produces a solution that admits the same\noptimal rate after sufficient iterations. As a byproduct, we also establish the\nconcentration inequality for estimat- ing population mean when there exists\nonly the second moment.

This analysis of magnetic fields of source\nAR suggest that the cancelling fluxes are prime factors to the monotonous\ntwisting of the FR system reaching to a critical state to trigger kink\ninstability and the rise motion. This rise motion possibly led to onset of\ntorus instability resulting in Earth-directed CME and the progressive\nreconnection in thinning current sheet underneath the rising FR leads to M6.5\nflare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 15:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

If confirmed, such large local underdensities would have\nimportant implications on the interpretation of local measurements of\ncosmological parameters.

In this paper we study the\nlocal density distribution in the southern sky with the X-ray detected galaxy\nclusters from the REFLEX II cluster survey. From the normalized comoving number\ndensity of clusters we find an average underdensity of ~30 - 40% in the\nredshift range out to z ~0.04 (~170 Mpc) in the southern extragalactic sky with\na significance larger than 3.4sigma.

The two essential prerequisites\nfor data configuration with regards to compliance with Benford's Law are high\norder of magnitude and positive skewness with a tail falling to the right of\nthe histogram, so that quantitative configuration is such that the small is\nnumerous and the big is rare. A related topic in the study of Benford's Law is\nthe stark contrast between multiplications and additions of random variables\nand their distinct resultant quantitative and digital configurations. Random\nmultiplication processes induce substantial increase in order of magnitude and\nthey tend to the skewed Lognormal Distribution, favoring the small over the\nbig.

In particular, we show that previous estimates\nof this rate ignored the exponential cutoff in the scattering amplitude at\nlarge wavenumber and assumed that the damping of scattered waves entirely\ndepends on collisions, ignoring collisionless processes. We find that the total\nwave energy eventually grows to approximate equipartition with the beam by\nincreasingly depositing energy into long wavelength modes. As we have not\nincluded the effect of nonlinear wave-wave interactions on these long\nwavelength modes, this scenario represents the \"worst-case\" scenario for the\noblique instability. As it continues to drain energy from the beam at a faster\nrate than other processes, we conclude that the \"oblique\" instability is\nsufficiently strong to make it the physically dominant cooling mechanism for\nhigh-energy pair beams in the intergalactic medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 03:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The proposed NBI cancellation scheme exploits the\nfrequency domain sparsity of the unknown signal and adopts a low complexity\nBayesian sparse recovery procedure. At the transmitter, a few randomly chosen\nsub-carriers are kept data free to sense the NBI signal at the receiver.\nFurther, it is noted that in practice, the sparsity of the NBI signal is\ndestroyed by a grid mismatch between NBI sources and the system under\nconsideration. Towards this end, first an accurate grid mismatch model is\npresented that is capable of assuming independent offsets for multiple NBI\nsources. Secondly, prior to NBI reconstruction, the sparsity of the unknown\nsignal is restored by employing a sparsifying transform. To improve the\nspectral efficiency of the proposed scheme, a data-aided NBI recovery procedure\nis outlined that relies on adaptively selecting a subset of data carriers and\nuses them as additional measurements to enhance the NBI estimation.
