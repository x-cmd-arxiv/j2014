Unfortunately, the pair correlation function $g(r)$ inferred from\nneutron scattering measurements of the differential cross section $d\\sigma\n\\over d\\Omega$ from different measurements reported in the literature are\ninconsistent. We have measured the energy dependence of the total cross section\nand the scattering cross section for slow neutrons with energies between\n0.43~meV and 16.1~meV on liquid hydrogen at 15.6~K (which is dominated by the\nparahydrogen component) using neutron transmission measurements on the hydrogen\ntarget of the NPDGamma collaboration at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak\nRidge National Laboratory. The relationship between the neutron transmission\nmeasurement we perform and the total cross section is unambiguous, and the\nenergy range accesses length scales where the pair correlation function is\nrapidly varying. At 1~meV our measurement is a factor of 3 below the data from\nprevious work. We present evidence that these previous measurements of the\nhydrogen cross section, which assumed that the equilibrium value for the ratio\nof orthohydrogen and parahydrogen has been reached in the target liquid, were\nin fact contaminated with an extra non-equilibrium component of orthohydrogen.\nLiquid parahydrogen is also a widely-used neutron moderator medium, and an\naccurate knowledge of its slow neutron cross section is essential for the\ndesign and optimization of intense slow neutron sources. We describe our\nmeasurements and compare them with previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 16:01:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 21:58:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 15:30:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

In 1960 Ghouila-Houri obtained\nan analogue statement for digraphs by showing that every directed graph on\n$n\\geq 3$ vertices with minimum in- and out-degree at least $n/2$ contains a\ndirected Hamilton cycle. Both statements quantify the robustness of complete\ngraphs (digraphs) with respect to the property of containing a Hamilton cycle.\n  A natural way to generalize such results to arbitrary graphs (digraphs) is\nusing the notion of \\emph{local resilience}. The local resilience of a graph\n(digraph) $G$ with respect to a property $\\mathcal{P}$ is the maximum number\n$r$ such that $G$ has the property $\\mathcal{P}$ even if we allow an adversary\nto remove an $r$-fraction of (in- and out-going) edges touching each vertex.\nThe theorems of Dirac and Ghouila-Houri state that the local resilience of the\ncomplete graph and digraph with respect to Hamiltonicity is $1/2$. Recently,\nthis statements have been generalized to random settings. Lee and Sudakov\n(2012) proved that the local resilience of a random graph with edge probability\n$p=\\omega(\\log n /n)$ with respect to Hamiltonicity is $1/2\\pm o(1)$.

Power spectra of the surface\nfluctuation of the gel allowed identification of its resonant frequency that\ndecreases with their mass, but increases with its shear modulus. The principal\nresonant frequencies of the spheroidal modes of the gel of shear moduli ranging\nfrom 55 Pa to 290 Pa were closest to the lowest Rayleigh mode of vibration of a\ndrop of pure water. These observations coupled with the fact that the resonance\nfrequency varies inversely as the square root of the mass in all cases suggest\nthat they primarily correspond to the capillary (or a pseudo-capillary) mode of\ndrop vibration.

In\nthis theory, the strength of Anderson localization confinement is determined by\nthis landscape, and continuously decreases as the energy increases. However,\nthis picture has to be changed in discrete lattices in which the eigenmodes\nclose to the edge of the first Brillouin zone are as localized as the low\nenergy ones.

The\nmethod is most suited to probing fields that are coherent on large scales; in\nthis paper, we consider a homogenous magnetic field over the scale of the 21-cm\nfluctuations.

Remarkably we find that the CO in Nd2-xCexCuO4 occurs with similar\nperiodicity, and along the same direction, as the CO in p-type cuprates.\nHowever, in contrast to the latter, the CO onset in Nd2-xCexCuO4 is higher than\nthe pseudogap temperature, and is actually in the same temperature range where\nantiferromagnetic fluctuations are first detected -- thereby showing that CO\nand antiferromagnetic fluctuations are likely coupled in n-type cuprates.\nOverall our discovery uncovers a missing piece of the cuprate phase diagram and\nopens a parallel path to the study of CO and its relationship to other\nphenomena, such as antiferromagnetism (AF) and high-temperature\nsuperconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 20:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-20"}

According to their radial velocities, 109\nBSSs are members of the system. The rotational velocity distribution is very\nbroad, with the bulk of BSSs spinning at less than ~40 km/s (in agreement with\nthe majority of such stars observed in other globular clusters) and a long tail\nreaching ~200 km/s.

The strong dependence of surface brightness dimming on redshift z\nsuggests the presence of a selection bias when searching for high-redshift\ngalaxies, i.e. we tend to detect only those galaxies with a high surface\nbrightness (SB). However, unresolved knots of emission are not affected by SB\ndimming, thus providing a way to test the clumpiness of high-z galaxies. Our\nstrategy relies on the comparison of the total flux detected for the same\nsource in surveys characterized by different depth. For all galaxies, deeper\nimages permit the better investigation of low-SB features. Cosmological SB\ndimming makes these low-SB features hard to detect when going to higher and\nhigher redshifts.

Whereas the AKLT states are created\nby application of bond singlet operators for SU(2) spins, the simplex solid\nconstruction is based on N-simplex singlet operators for SU(N) spins. In both\ncases, a discrete one-parameter family of translationally-invariant models with\nexactly solvable ground states is defined on any regular lattice, and the equal\ntime ground state correlations are given by the finite temperature correlations\nof an associated classical model on the same lattice, owing to the product form\nof the wave functions when expressed in a CP^{N-1} coherent state\nrepresentation. We study these classical companion models via a mix of Monte\nCarlo simulations, mean-field arguments, and low-temperature effective field\ntheories. Our analysis reveals that the ground states of SU(4) edge- and SU(8)\nface-sharing cubic lattice simplex solid models are long range ordered for\nsufficiently large values of the discrete parameter, whereas the ground states\nof the SU(3) models on the kagome (2D) and hyperkagome (3D) lattices are always\nquantum disordered.

The SNe winds are responsible for no\nmore than 3% of it and of the iron mass and 21% of the oxygen mass enclosed\nwithin r2500.

Counteracting\nthis by appropriately measuring the environment (and therefore projecting its\nstate) would require access all the necessary degrees of freedom, which in\npractice can be far too hard to achieve. To better understand one's\nlimitations, we calculate the upper bound of optimal quantum erasure (i.e. the\nhighest recoverable visibility, or \"coherence\"), when erasure is realistically\nlimited to an accessible subspace of the whole environment. In the particular\ncase of a two-dimensional accessible environment, the bound is given by the\nsub-fidelity of two particular states of the \\emph{inaccessible} environment,\nwhich opens a new window into understanding the connection between correlated\nsystems.

The data are\ncompared to a 2006 high-flux Suzaku observation when the source was ~10-times\nbrighter.

Blurred reflection\nfrom an accretion disc around a nearly maximum spinning black hole (a>0.91,\nwith preference for a spin parameter as high as ~ 0.995) appears more likely\nand is consistent with the long-term and rapid variability. Measurements of the\nemissivity profile and spectral modelling indicate the high-flux Suzaku\nobservation of Mrk 335 is consistent with continuum-dominated, jet-like\nemission (i.e. beamed away from the disc). It can be argued that the ejecta\nmust be confined to within ~25 rg if it does not escape the system. During the\nlow-flux state the corona becomes compact and only extends to about 5 rg from\nthe black hole, and the spectrum becomes reflection-dominated.

Various\ntechniques to study the spectral variability (e.g. principal component\nanalysis, fractional variability, difference spectra, and hardness ratio\nanalysis) indicate that the low-state variability is dominated by changes in\nthe power law flux and photon index, but that changes in the ionisation state\nof the reflector are also required.

The\napplication of the simple geometrical model to the Douglas-fir and Scots pine\ndata suggests that the slope of the self-thinning curve will not remain\nconstant during the course of growth and self-thinning of a single forest\nstand. Most probable, at the initial stages of stand growth the slope will be\nless than -3/2 and at old ages of the stand the slope will be higher than -3/2.\nInevitably, a time will come when the slope is exactly equals -3/2. In other\nwords, the slope -3/2 is an obligatory state in the course of self-thinning of\na forest stand. At the very time of -3/2 slope two particular features coincide\nwith it. One is that the total bole surface area remains constant. The length\nof the constancy stage would probably vary with species, initial stand\ndensities, their spatial arrangements, conditions of growth, and other specific\nfactors. Another feature of the time is that a geometric similarity in the\ngrowth of the forest stand takes place, which is not in a contradiction with\nthe -3/2 rule as it had been formulated by its authors. To put it shortly, the\nslope -3/2: i) is a very specific and obligatory state in the process of forest\nstand growth and ii) is not an asymptote but rather a transitional point (span)\nin the time of growth. These two assertions may be called a transitional status\nof the -3/2 rule. The geometric model of a forest stand (Gavrikov, 2014) has\nproved to be rather helpful at analyzing of real forest stand structure and\ndynamics. Despite of its extreme simplicity (it uses cones as representations\nof trees) the model looks like having enough similarity with real even-aged\nforests since the model's predictions are often reasonably close to measured\nvalues of power exponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2014 05:18:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-10"}

It was\nfound that 15 month after the incident concentrations of radiocesium in the\nJapan and Okhotsk seas were at background or slightly increased level, while\nthey had increased values in the subarctic front area east of Japan. The\nhighest concentrations of $^{134}$Cs and $^{137}$Cs up to 13.5 ${\\pm}$ 0.9 and\n22.7 ${\\pm}$ 1.5 Bq m$^{-3}$ have been found to exceed ten times the background\nlevels before the accident. Maximal content of radiocesium was observed within\nsubsurface and intermediate water layers inside the cores of anticyclonic\neddies (100 - 500 m). Even slightly increased content of radiocesium was found\nat some eddies at depth of 1000 m. It is expected that convergence and\nsubduction of surface water inside eddies are main mechanisms of downward\ntransport of radionuclides. In situ observations are compared with the results\nof simulated advection of these radioisotopes by the AVISO altimetric velocity\nfield. Different Lagrangian diagnostics are used to reconstruct the history and\norigin of synthetic tracers imitating measured seawater samples collected in\neach of those eddies. The results of observations are consistent with the\nsimulated results. It is shown that the tracers, simulating water samples with\nincreased radioactivity to be measured in the cruise, really visited the areas\nwith presumably high level of contamination. Fast water advection between\nanticyclonic eddies and convergence of surface water inside eddies make them\nresponsible for spreading, accumulation and downward transport of cesium rich\nwater to the intermediate depth in the frontal zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2014 05:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Another side is to generate the\ncircuit from its behavioral description described in FSM form.

An instance of such a problem consists of\na set of variables V and a set of constraints C, where each constraint is an\nordered triple of distinct elements from V. The goal is to construct a linear\norder alpha on V such that, for each constraint (a,b,c) in C, the ordering of\na,b,c induced by alpha is in Pi. Excluding symmetries and trivial cases there\nare 11 such problems, and their complexity is well known. Here we consider the\nvariant of the problem, denoted 2-Pi, where we are allowed to construct two\nlinear orders alpha and beta and each constraint needs to be satisfied by at\nleast one of the two. We give a full complexity classification of all 11 2-Pi\nproblems, observing that in the switch from one to two linear orders the\ncomplexity landscape changes quite abruptly and that hardness proofs become\nrather intricate. We then focus on one of the 11 problems in particular, which\nis closely related to the '2-Caterpillar Compatibility' problem in the\nphylogenetics literature. We show that this particular CSP remains hard on\nthree linear orders, and also in the biologically relevant case when we swap\nthree linear orders for three phylogenetic trees, yielding the '3-Tree\nCompatibility' problem.

Reversible computing has emerged as a solution looking to the\npower and speed requirements of future computing devices. In reversible\ncomputing logic gates used are such that input can be generated by reversing\nthe operation from output. A number of reversible combinational circuits have\nbeen developed but the growth of sequential circuits was not significant due to\nfeedback and fanout was not allowed.

Because WASP-43b receives a similar\nstellar flux as HD 209458b but has a rotation rate 4 times faster and a much\nhigher gravity, studying WASP-43b serves as a test of the effect of rotation\nrate and gravity on the circulation when stellar irradiation is held\napproximately constant.

We find\nthat the circulation regime of WASP-43b is not unlike other hot Jupiters, with\nequatorial superrotation that yields an eastward-shifted hotspot and large\nday-night temperature variations (~600 K at photospheric pressures). We then\ncompare our model results to observations from Stevenson et al. which utilize\nHST/WFC3 to collect spectrophotometric phase curve measurements of WASP-43b\nfrom 1.12-1.65 microns.

The\nlow-CP-rank tensor is modeled by multilinear interactions between multiple\nlatent factors on which the column sparsity is enforced by a hierarchical\nprior, while the sparse tensor is modeled by a hierarchical view of Student-$t$\ndistribution that associates an individual hyperparameter with each element\nindependently.

We examine models in which massive stars\ngain mass soon after the end of core hydrogen burning. These are mainly\nintended to represent mergers following a brief contact phase during early Case\nB mass transfer, but may also represent stars which gain mass in the\nHertzsprung Gap or extremely late during the main-sequence phase for other\nreasons. The post-accretion stars spend their core helium-burning phase as blue\nsupergiants (BSGs), and many examples are consistent with being LBVs at the\ntime of core collapse. Other examples are yellow supergiants at explosion. We\nalso investigate whether such post-accretion stars may explode successfully\nafter core collapse. The final core properties of post-accretion models are\nbroadly similar to those of single stars with the same initial mass as the\npre-merger primary star. More surprisingly, when early Case B accretion does\naffect the final core properties, the effect appears likely to favour a\nsuccessful SN explosion, i.e., to make the core properties more like those of a\nlower-mass single star. However, the detailed structures of these cores\nsometimes display qualitative differences to any single-star model we have\ncalculated.

This analysis is aimed at\nproviding statistical information about the accuracy generally achieved by the\nsoftwares for automatic surface photometry of galaxies. Results. For each\ngalaxy and for each photometric band the GASPHOT catalogs provide the\nparameters of the Sersic law best-fitting the luminosity profiles. They are:\nthe sky coordinates of the galaxy center (R:A:; DEC:), the total magnitude (m),\nthe semi-major axis of the effective isophote (Re), the Sersic index (n), the\naxis ratio (b=a) and a flag parameter (QFLAG) giving a global indication of the\nfit quality. The WINGS-GASPHOT database includes 41,463 galaxies in the B-band,\n42,275 in the V-band, and 71,687 in the K-band. We find that the bright\nearly-type galaxies have larger Sersic indices and effective radii, as well as\nredder colors in their center.

Funke et al. formulated the question of the best\nturbine layout as an optimisation problem constrained by the shallow water\nequations and solved it using a local, gradient-based optimisation algorithm.\nGiven the local nature of this approach, the question arises of how optimal the\nlayouts actually are. This becomes particularly important for scenarios with\ncomplex bathymetry and layout constraints, both of which typically introduce\nlocally optimal layouts. Optimisation algorithms which find the global optima\ngenerally require orders of magnitude more iterations than local optimisation\nalgorithms and are thus infeasible in combination with an expensive flow model.\nThis paper presents an analytical wake model to act as an efficient proxy to\nthe shallow water model. Based upon this, a hybrid global-local two-stage\noptimisation approach is presented in which turbine layouts are first optimised\nwith the analytical wake model via a global optimisation algorithm, and further\noptimised with the shallow water model via a local gradient-based optimisation\nalgorithm. This procedure is applied to a number of idealised cases and a more\nrealistic case with complex bathymetry in the Pentland Firth, Scotland. It is\nshown that in cases where bathymetry is considered, the two-stage optimisation\nprocedure is able to improve the power extracted from the array by as much as\n25% compared to local optimisation for idealised scenarios and by as much as\n12% for the more realistic Pentland Firth scenario whilst in many cases\nreducing the overall computation time by approximately 35%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2014 14:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

This was demon- strated by the 33 MJ muzzle energy\nshot performed in 2010 in the framework of the Office of Naval Research (ONR)\nelectromag- netic railgun program. Since then, railguns are a prime candidate\nfor future long range artillery systems. In this scenario, a heavy projectile\n(several kilograms) is accelerated to approx. 2.5 km/s muzzle velocity. While\nthe primary interest for such a hypersonic projectile is the bombardment of\ntargets being hundreds of kilometers away, they can also be used to counter\nairplane attacks or in other direct fire scenarios. In these cases, the large\ninitial velocity significantly reduces the time to impact the target. In this\nstudy we investigate a scenario, where a future shipboard railgun installation\ndelivers the same kinetic energy to a target as the explosive round of a\ncontemporary European ship artillery system. At the same time the railgun\noutperforms the current artillery systems in range. For this scenario a first\ndraft for the parameters of a railgun system were derived. For the flight-path\nof the projectile, trajectories for different launch angles were simulated and\nthe aero-thermodynamic heating was estimated using engineering-tools developed\nwithin the German Aerospace Center (DLR). This enables the assessment of the\nfeasibility of the different strike scenarios, as well as the identification of\nthe limits of the technology. It is envisioned that this baseline design can be\nused as a helpful starting point for discussions of a possible electrical\nweaponization of future European warships.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2014 14:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

While various models predict similar proton drip\nline, their predictions for neutron drip line and the r-process paths involving\nheavy neutron-rich nuclei exhibit a significant variation which hampers our\naccurate understanding of the r-process nucleosynthesis mechanism. Using\nmicroscopic density functional theory with a representative set of\nnon-relativistic and relativistic interactions, we demonstrate for the first\ntime that this variation is mainly due to the uncertainty of nuclear matter\nsymmetry energy $E_{\\rm{sym}}(\\rho_{\\rm{sc}})$ at the subsaturation cross\ndensity $\\rho_{\\rm{sc}}=0.11/0.16\\times\\rho_0$ ($\\rho_0$ is saturation\ndensity), which reflects the symmetry energy of heavy nuclei.

In addition, the surveys also probe primordial\nperturbations and carry out fundamental measurements, such as determining the\nsum of neutrino masses. Large-scale simulations of structure formation in the\nUniverse play a critical role in the interpretation of the data and extraction\nof the physics of interest. Just as survey instruments continue to grow in size\nand complexity, so do the supercomputers that enable these simulations. Here we\nreport on HACC (Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code), a recently\ndeveloped and evolving cosmology N-body code framework, designed to run\nefficiently on diverse computing architectures and to scale to millions of\ncores and beyond. HACC can run on all current supercomputer architectures and\nsupports a variety of programming models and algorithms. It has been\ndemonstrated at scale on Cell- and GPU-accelerated systems, standard multi-core\nnode clusters, and Blue Gene systems. HACC's design allows for ease of\nportability, and at the same time, high levels of sustained performance on the\nfastest supercomputers available. We present a description of the design\nphilosophy of HACC, the underlying algorithms and code structure, and outline\nimplementation details for several specific architectures. We show selected\naccuracy and performance results from some of the largest high resolution\ncosmological simulations so far performed, including benchmarks evolving more\nthan 3.6 trillion particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 22:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

To tackle this\nproblem, a framework called game-theoretic machine learning (GTML) was recently\nproposed, which first learns a Markov behavior model to characterize agents'\nbehaviors, and then learns the optimal mechanism by simulating agents' behavior\nchanges in response to the mechanism. While GTML has demonstrated practical\nsuccess, its generalization analysis is challenging because the behavior data\nare non-i.i.d. and dependent on the mechanism. To address this challenge,\nfirst, we decompose the generalization error for GTML into the behavior\nlearning error and the mechanism learning error; second, for the behavior\nlearning error, we obtain novel non-asymptotic error bounds for both parametric\nand non-parametric behavior learning methods; third, for the mechanism learning\nerror, we derive a uniform convergence bound based on a new concept called\nnested covering number of the mechanism space and the generalization analysis\ntechniques developed for mixing sequences. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first work on the generalization analysis of GTML, and we believe it has\ngeneral implications to the theoretical analysis of other complicated machine\nlearning problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2014 03:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

This 'double cover' property is potential problem in geometrical\napplication of split quaternions, since (2+2)-signature of their norms should\nnot be changed for each product. If split quaternions form proper algebraic\nstructure for microphysics, representation of boosts in (2+1)-space leads to\nthe interpretation of the scalar part of quaternions as wavelength of\nparticles. Invariance of space-time intervals and some quantum behavior, like\nnoncommutativity and fundamental spinor representation, probably also are\nalgebraic properties.
