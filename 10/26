Project-based learning is used to help\nstudents build professional skills. However, it is typically applied to small\nteams and small efforts. This paper describes an experience in engaging a large\nnumber of students in research projects within a multi-year interdisciplinary\nresearch effort. The projects expose the students to various disciplines in\nComputer Science (embedded systems, algorithm design, networking), Electrical\nEngineering (circuit design, wireless communications, hardware prototyping),\nand Applied Physics (thin-film battery design, solar cell fabrication). While a\nstudent project is usually focused on one discipline area, it requires\ninteraction with at least two other areas. Over 5 years, 180 semester-long\nprojects have been completed. The students were a diverse group of high school,\nundergraduate, and M.S. Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical\nEngineering students. Some of the approaches that were taken to facilitate\nstudent learning are real-world system development constraints, regular\ncross-group meetings, and extensive involvement of Ph.D. students in student\nmentorship and knowledge transfer. To assess the approaches, a survey was\nconducted among the participating students. The results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the approaches. For example, 70% of the students surveyed\nindicated that working on their research project improved their ability to\nfunction on multidisciplinary teams more than coursework, internships, or any\nother activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2014 16:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-28"}

The widespread misinterpretation of the criterion as\nfailure probability and also its actual scope have been discussed previously.\nRecently its distinguishability advantage interpretation is re-emphasized as an\noperational guarantee, and the failure probability misinterpretation is\nmaintained with a further failure probability per bit interpretation. In this\npaper we explain the basic perpetuating error as a confusion on the\ncorrespondence between mathematics and reality. We note that the assignment of\nequal a priori probability of 1/2 to the real and ideal situations for\ndistinguishability advantage would not lead to operational guarantee. We\nexplain why operational guarantee in terms of Eve's probabilities of getting\nvarious key bits is necessary for security, and why the failure probability\ninterpretation misrepresents the security situation. The scope and limits of\nthe trace distance guarantee are summarized. It is shown that there would have\nbeen no security problem to begin with if the failure probability per bit\ninterpretation validity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2014 18:11:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-28"}

This makes difficult a cost-effective\nprocedure for monitoring, fault detection, performance analyses, operation and\nmaintenance. As a result, many problems affecting BIPV systems go undetected.\nIn order to carry out effective automatic fault detection procedures, we need a\nperformance indicator that is reliable and that can be applied on many PV\nsystems at a very low cost. The existing approaches for analyzing the\nperformance of PV systems are often based on the Performance Ratio (PR), whose\naccuracy depends on good solar irradiation data, which in turn can be very\ndifficult to obtain or cost-prohibitive for the BIPV owner. We present an\nalternative fault detection procedure based on a performance indicator that can\nbe constructed on the sole basis of the energy production data measured at the\nBIPV systems. This procedure does not require the input of operating conditions\ndata, such as solar irradiation, air temperature, or wind speed. The\nperformance indicator, called Performance to Peers (P2P), is constructed from\nspatial and temporal correlations between the energy output of neighboring and\nsimilar PV systems. This method was developed from the analysis of the energy\nproduction data of approximately 10,000 BIPV systems located in Europe. The\nresults of our procedure are illustrated on the hourly, daily and monthly data\nmonitored during one year at one BIPV system located in the South of Belgium.\nOur results confirm that it is possible to carry out automatic fault detection\nprocedures without solar irradiation data. P2P proves to be more stable than PR\nmost of the time, and thus constitutes a more reliable performance indicator\nfor fault detection procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2014 18:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-28"}

Consequently, current\nactive fire satellite detection products should be used to improve fire\nmodeling in a statistical sense only, rather than as a direct input.

This method is inspired by contour detection methods used in\ncomputer vision, and it can be cast as a Bayesian inverse problem technique, or\na generalized Tikhonov regularization. After the new fire arrival time on the\nwhole simulation domain is found, the model can be re-run from a time in the\npast using the new fire arrival time to generate the heat fluxes and to spin up\nthe atmospheric model until the satellite overpass time, when the coupled\nsimulation continues from the modified state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2014 18:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

We propose a new flexible method to predict weak\nlensing peak counts, which can be adapted to realistic scenarios, such as a\nreal source distribution, intrinsic galaxy alignment, mask effects, photo-$z$\nerrors from surveys, etc. The new model is also suitable for applying the\ntomography technique and non-linear filters. A probabilistic approach to model\npeak counts is presented. First, we sample halos from a mass function. Second,\nwe assign them NFW profiles. Third, we place those halos randomly on the field\nof view. The creation of these \"fast simulations\" requires much less computing\ntime compared to $N$-body runs. Then, we perform ray-tracing through these fast\nsimulation boxes and select peaks from weak-lensing maps to predict peak number\ncounts. The computation is achieved by our \\textsc{Camelus} algorithm, which we\nmake available at http://www.cosmostat.org/software/camelus/ . We compare our\nresults to $N$-body simulations to validate our model. We find that our\napproach is in good agreement with full $N$-body runs. We show that the lensing\nsignal dominates shape noise and Poisson noise for peaks with SNR between 4 and\n6. Also, counts from the same SNR range are sensitive to $\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$\nand $\\sigma_8$. We show how our model can discriminate between various\ncombinations of those two parameters. In summary, we offer a powerful tool to\nstudy weak lensing peaks. The potential of our forward model is its high\nflexibility, making the use of peak counts under realistic survey conditions\nfeasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2014 19:49:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jan 2015 12:44:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2015 09:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-25"}

This conclusion legitimates the use of broadcast-like diffusion\nprotocols, which are easier to implement.

The method is popularly used and works well\nin practice despite the simplicity of the setting, but its statistical\nmechanism is not yet well-understood. In this paper we provide strong\ntheoretical guarantees regarding learning with random decision trees. We\nanalyze and compare three different variants of the algorithm that have minimal\nmemory requirements: majority voting, threshold averaging and probabilistic\naveraging. The random structure of the tree enables us to adapt these methods\nto a differentially-private setting thus we also propose differentially-private\nversions of all three schemes. We give upper-bounds on the generalization error\nand mathematically explain how the accuracy depends on the number of random\ndecision trees.

The\ninference problem of recovering topics from admixtures, is NP-hard. Assuming\nseparability, a strong assumption, [4] gave the first provable algorithm for\ninference. For LDA model, [6] gave a provable algorithm using tensor-methods.\nBut [4,6] do not learn topic vectors with bounded $l_1$ error (a natural\nmeasure for probability vectors). Our aim is to develop a model which makes\nintuitive and empirically supported assumptions and to design an algorithm with\nnatural, simple components such as SVD, which provably solves the inference\nproblem for the model with bounded $l_1$ error. A topic in LDA and other models\nis essentially characterized by a group of co-occurring words. Motivated by\nthis, we introduce topic specific Catchwords, group of words which occur with\nstrictly greater frequency in a topic than any other topic individually and are\nrequired to have high frequency together rather than individually. A major\ncontribution of the paper is to show that under this more realistic assumption,\nwhich is empirically verified on real corpora, a singular value decomposition\n(SVD) based algorithm with a crucial pre-processing step of thresholding, can\nprovably recover the topics from a collection of documents drawn from Dominant\nadmixtures. Dominant admixtures are convex combination of distributions in\nwhich one distribution has a significantly higher contribution than others.\nApart from the simplicity of the algorithm, the sample complexity has near\noptimal dependence on $w_0$, the lowest probability that a topic is dominant,\nand is better than [4]. Empirical evidence shows that on several real world\ncorpora, both Catchwords and Dominant admixture assumptions hold and the\nproposed algorithm substantially outperforms the state of the art [5].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Oct 2014 06:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 17:27:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 05:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}

In topological insulators, the metallic surface states\nare protected from impurity backscattering due to spin-momentum locking. This\nopens up new perspectives in engineering multifunctional materials. In this\narticle, we introduce half Heusler materials from the crystallographic and\nelectronic structure point of view.

There are growing interests in classification of dynamic or\nfunctional data. The basic feature of functional data is that the functional\ndata have infinite dimensions and are highly correlated. An essential issue for\nclassifying dynamic and functional data is how to effectively reduce their\ndimension and explore dynamic feature. However, few statistical methods for\ndynamic data classification have directly used rich dynamic features of the\ndata. We propose to use second order ordinary differential equation (ODE) to\nmodel dynamic process and principal differential analysis to estimate constant\nor time-varying parameters in the ODE. We examine differential dynamic\nproperties of the dynamic system across different conditions including\nstability and transient-response, which determine how the dynamic systems\nmaintain their functions and performance under a broad range of random internal\nand external perturbations. We use the parameters in the ODE as features for\nclassifiers. As a proof of principle, the proposed methods are applied to\nclassifying normal and abnormal QRS complexes in the electrocardiogram (ECG)\ndata analysis, which is of great clinical values in diagnosis of cardiovascular\ndiseases. We show that the ODE-based classification methods in QRS complex\nclassification outperform the currently widely used neural networks with\nFourier expansion coefficients of the functional data as their features.

Central point of the model implies the occurrence of unconventional\non-site quantum superpositions of the three valent states characterized by\ndifferent hole occupation, $n_h$=0,1,2, conventional spin s=1/2 for Cu$^{2+}$\nand s=0 for Cu$^{1+,3+}$ centers, and different orbital symmetry:$B_{1g}$ for\nthe ground states of the Cu$^{2+}$ center and $A_{1g}$ for the Cu$^{1+,3+}$\ncenters, respectively. The latter does result in a spontaneous orbital symmetry\nbreaking with emergence of the IUC orbital nematic order parameter of the\n$B_{1g}\\propto d_{x2-y2}$ symmetry. To describe the quantum local charge order\nwe develop an S=1 pseudospin model. Conventional spin density $\\rho_s$ for\nmixed valence superpositions can vary inbetween 0 and 1 in accordance with the\nweight of the Cu$^{2+}$ center in the superposition.

While the well-known rules and mechanisms behind\nfolding a flat surface have been used to create deployable structures and shape\ntransformable materials, folding of curved shells is still not fundamentally\nunderstood. Curved shells naturally deform by simultaneously bending and\nstretching, and while this coupling gives them great stability for engineering\napplications, it makes folding a surface of arbitrary curvature a non-trivial\ntask. Here we discuss the geometry of folding a creased shell, and demonstrate\ntheoretically the conditions under which it may fold continuously.

We discuss here how two fundamental geometric\nconcepts, creases and curvature, combine to allow rapid transitions from one\nstable state to another.

The Conjecture is still open. Some time ago its\ndirected version was formulated (see:\\cite{alon}). In the directed version\ngraphs are replaced by tournaments, and cliques and stable sets by transitive\nsubtournaments. If the Conjecture is not true then the smallest counterexample\nis a prime tournament. For a long time the Conjecture was known only for\nfinitely many prime tournaments. Recently in \\cite{bcc} and \\cite{choromanski2}\nthe Conjecture was proven for the families of galaxies and constellations that\ncontain infinitely many prime tournaments. In \\cite{bcc} the Conjecture was\nalso proven for all $5$-vertex tournaments. We say that a tournament $H$ has\nthe $EH$-property if it satisfies the Conjecture. In this paper we introduce\nthe so-called \\textit{strong EH-property} which enables us to prove the\nConjecture for new prime tournaments, but what is even more interesting,\nprovides a mechanism to combine tournaments satisfying the Conjecture to get\nbigger tournaments that do so and are not necessarily nonprime. We give several\nexamples of families of tournaments constructed according to this procedure.\nThe only procedure known before used to construct bigger tournaments satisfying\nthe Conjecture from smaller tournaments satisfying the Conjecture was the\nso-called \\textit{substitution procedure} (see: \\cite{alon}). However an\noutcome of this procedure is always a nonprime tournament and, from what we\nhave said before, prime tournaments are those that play crucial role in the\nresearch on the Conjecture. Our method may be potentially used to prove the\nConjecture for several new classes of tournaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Oct 2014 15:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-28"}

The first key\ncomponent of the algebraic representation is the usage of two non-commutative\nreal trilinear operations as the building blocks of the approximation. These\noperations are the standard three dimensional triple-product and a trilinear\nproduct on a two-dimensional real vector space, which is a representation of\nthe real Clifford Algebra Cl(1,1) (a certain Majorana spinor). Both operations\nare purely ternary in that they cannot be decomposed into two group-operations\non the relevant spaces.

This internal linear\nmomentum of the system is related to the controversial concept of \"hidden\nmomentum.\" We suggest that the term \"hidden momentum\" be abandoned. Here we use\nthe relativistic conservation law for the center of energy to give an\nunambiguous definition of the \"internal momentum of a system,\" and then we\nexhibit this internal momentum for the system of a magnet (modeled as a\ncircular ring of moving charges) and a distant static point charge. The\ncalculations provide clear illustrations of this system for three cases: a) the\nmoving charges of the magnet are assumed to continue in their unperturbed\nmotion, b) the moving charges of the magnet are free to accelerate but have no\nmutual interactions, and c) the moving charges of the magnet are free to\naccelerate and also interact with each other. It is noted that when the\ncurrent-carrying charges of the magnet are allowed to interact, the magnet\nitself will contain internal electromagnetic linear momentum, something which\nhas not been presented clearly in the research and teaching literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Oct 2014 12:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-26"}
