Studies have been performed to quantify its impact on infrared\ninterferometry, but not in the visible domain, which however allows reaching\nbetter angular resolution and is also the one mostly used for spectroscopic and\nphotometric measurements.\n  We use a standard case to completely analyse the impact of an exoplanet and a\nspot on interferometric observables and relate it to current instrument\ncapabilities, taking into account realistic achievable precisions.\n  We built a numerical code called COMETS using analytical formulae to perform\na simple comparison of exoplanet and spot signals. We explore instrumental\nspecificities needed to detect them, like the baseline length required, the\naccuracy and S/N. We also discuss the impact of exoplanet and spot parameters\non squared visibility and phase.\n  We find that the main improvement to bring is the sensitivity of instruments.\nThe accuracy on squared visibilities has to be improved by a factor 10 to\ndetect an exoplanet of 0.1 mas, leading to $<0.5%$ precision, along with phase\nmeasurements of ~$5^{\\deg}$ accuracy beyond the first null of visibility. For a\n0.05 mas exoplanet, accuracies of ~$0.1%$ and ~$1^{\\deg}$ from the first null\nare required on squared visibilities and phases, respectively. Magnetic spots\ncan mimic these signals, leading to false exoplanet characterization. Phases\nmeasurements from the 3rd lobe is needed to distinguish between a spot and an\nexoplanet if they have the same radius.\n  Increasing interferometer sensitivity, more objects will become common\nbetween interferometric targets and photometric ones. Furthermore, new missions\nlike PLATO, CHEOPS or TESS will provide bright exoplanet host stars.\nMeasurements will thus overlap and provide a better characterization of stellar\nactivity and exoplanet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 16:00:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 18:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-28"}

In this Paper,\nwe explore different aspects of the photometric properties of BPs and faculae,\nnamely their G-band contrast profiles, their peak contrast in G-band and\ncontinuum, as well as morphological parameters. We find that: (1) the width of\nthe contrast profiles of the classified BPs and faculae are consistent with\nstudies of disk center BPs at and limb faculae, which indirectly confirms the\nvalidity of our classification, (2) the profiles of limb faculae are limbward\nskewed on average, while near disk center they exhibit both centerward and\nlimbward skewnesses due to the distribution of orientations of the faculae, (3)\nthe relation between the peak contrasts of BPs and faculae and their apparent\narea discloses a trend reminiscent of magnetogram studies. The skewness of\nfacular profiles provides a novel constraint for 3D MHD models of faculae. As\nsuggested by the asymmetry and orientation of their contrast profiles, faculae\nnear disk center could be induced by inclined fields, while apparent BPs near\nthe limb seem to be in fact small faculae misidentified. The apparent area of\nBPs and faculae could be possibly exploited for proxy magnetometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 17:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}

In its simplest variant, the broadcasting problem, a\nmessage has to be spread among all nodes of a graph. A prominent communication\nprotocol for this problem is based on the random phone call model (Karp et al.,\nFOCS 2000). In each step, every node opens a communication channel to a\nrandomly chosen neighbor for bi-directional communication.\n  Motivated by replicated databases and peer-to-peer networks, Berenbrink et\nal., ICALP 2010, considered the gossiping problem in the random phone call\nmodel. There, each node starts with its own message and all messages have to be\ndisseminated to all nodes in the network. They showed that any $O(\\log n)$-time\nalgorithm in complete graphs requires $\\Omega(\\log n)$ message transmissions\nper node to complete gossiping, w.h.p, while for broadcasting the average\nnumber of transmissions per node is $O(\\log\\log n)$.\n  It is known that the $O(n\\log\\log n)$ bound on the number of transmissions\nrequired for randomized broadcasting in complete graphs cannot be achieved in\nsparse graphs even if they have best expansion and connectivity properties. In\nthis paper, we analyze whether a similar influence of the graph density also\nholds w.r.t. the performance of gossiping. We study analytically and\nempirically the communication overhead generated by randomized gossiping in\nrandom graphs and consider simple modifications of the random phone call model\nin these graphs. Our results indicate that, unlike in broadcasting, there is no\nsignificant difference between the performance of randomized gossiping in\ncomplete graphs and sparse random graphs. Furthermore, our simulations indicate\nthat by tuning the parameters of our algorithms, we can significantly reduce\nthe communication overhead compared to the traditional push-pull approach in\nthe graphs we consider.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 17:10:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 19:23:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 09:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

In cases where this process takes place it can be an alternative to the\nCE evolution where the secondary star is immerses in the giant's envelope. The\ngrazing envelope evolution (GEE) is made possible only if the companion manages\nto accrete mass at a high rate and launch jets that remove the outskirts of the\ngiant envelope, hence preventing the formation of a CE .

The key insight behind\nour approach is that through the lens of SMT solvers, refinement types can also\nbe viewed as a high-level, declarative, test generation technique, wherein\ntypes are converted to SMT queries whose models can be decoded into concrete\nprogram inputs. Our approach enables the systematic and exhaustive testing of\nimplementations from high-level declarative specifications, and furthermore,\nprovides a gradual path from testing to full verification. We have implemented\nour approach as a Haskell testing tool called TARGET, and present an evaluation\nthat shows how TARGET can be used to test a wide variety of properties and how\nit compares against state-of-the-art testing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 17:48:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 03:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

Randomly constructed samples explore\nparameter space for inclinations from 0 to 180 deg with 5deg increments\ntotalling nearly 6x10^5 numerical simulations. Thirty resonances internal and\nexternal to the planet's location are monitored. We find that retrograde\nresonances are unexpectedly more efficient at capture than prograde resonances\nand that resonance order is not necessarily a good indicator of capture\nefficiency at arbitrary inclination. Capture probability drops significantly at\nmoderate sample eccentricity for initial inclinations in the range\n[10deg,110deg]. Orbit inversion is possible for initially circular orbits with\ninclinations in the range [60deg,130deg]. Capture in the 1:1 coorbital\nresonance occurs with great likelihood at large retrograde inclinations. The\nplanet's orbital eccentricity, if larger than 0.1, reduces the capture\nprobabilities through the action of the eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism. A\ncapture asymmetry appears between inner and outer resonances as prograde orbits\nare preferentially trapped in inner resonances.

To do so, we compare two simulations --\nwith and without feedback -- both evolved with the moving mesh code AREPO. The\nfeedback runs implement the full physics model of the Illustris simulation\nproject, including star formation driven galactic winds and energetic feedback\nfrom supermassive blackholes. We explore: (a) the accretion rate of material\ncontributing to the net growth of galaxies and originating directly from the\nintergalactic medium, finding that feedback strongly suppresses the raw, as\nwell as the net, inflow of this \"smooth mode\" gas at all redshifts, regardless\nof the temperature history of newly acquired gas. (b) At the virial radius the\ntemperature and radial flux of inflowing gas is largely unaffected at z=2.\nHowever, the spherical covering fraction of inflowing gas at 0.25 rvir\ndecreases substantially, from more than 80% to less than 50%, while the rates\nof both inflow and outflow increase, indicative of recycling across this\nboundary. (c) The fractional contribution of smooth accretion to the total\naccretion rate is lower in the simulation with feedback, by roughly a factor of\ntwo across all redshifts. Moreover, the smooth component of gas with a cold\ntemperature history, is entirely suppressed in the feedback run at z<1. (d) The\namount of time taken by gas to cross from the virial radius to the galaxy --\nthe \"halo transit time\" -- increases in the presence of feedback by a factor of\n~2-3, and is notably independent of halo mass. We discuss the possible\nimplications of this invariance for theoretical models of hot halo gas cooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 20:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 18:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The new templates together with PL\nand PW relations provide Cepheid distances from single-epoch observations with\na precision only limited by the intrinsic accuracy of the method adopted. The\ntemplates rely on a very large set of Galactic and Magellanic Clouds (MCs)\nCepheids (FU,~600; FO,~200) with well sampled NIR (IRSF data) and optical (V,I;\nOGLE data) light curves. To properly trace the change in the shape of the light\ncurve as a function of period, we split the sample of calibrating Cepheids into\n10 different period bins. The templates for the first time cover FO Cepheids\nand the FU short-period Cepheids (P<5 days). Moreover, the zero-point phase is\nanchored to the phase of the mean magnitude along the rising branch. The new\napproach has several advantages in sampling the light curve of bump Cepheids\nwhen compared with the phase of maximum light. We also provide new estimates of\nthe NIR-to-optical amplitude ratios for FU and FO Cepheids. We perform detailed\nanalytical fits using both 7th-order Fourier series and multi-Gaussian periodic\nfunctions. The latter are characterized by a smaller number of free parameters\n(9 vs 15). Mean NIR magnitudes based on the new templates are up to 80% more\naccurate than single-epoch measurements and up to 50% more accurate than mean\nmagnitudes based on previous templates, with typical associated uncertainties\nranging from 0.015 mag (J) to 0.019 mag (K). Moreover, the errors on individual\ndistances of Small MC Cepheids derived from NIR PW relations, are essentially\nreduced to the intrinsic scatter of the adopted relations.

Here we investigate binary\nevolution in close LMXBs to study the formation of radio MSPs with low-mass\nhelium white dwarf companions (He WDs) in tight binaries with orbital periods\nP_orb = 2-9 hr. In particular, we examine: i) if such observed systems can be\nreproduced from theoretical modelling using standard prescriptions of orbital\nangular momentum losses (i.e. with respect to the nature and the strength of\nmagnetic braking), ii) if our computations of the Roche-lobe detachments can\nmatch the observed orbital periods, and iii) if the correlation between WD mass\nand orbital period (M_WD, P_orb) is valid for systems with P_orb < 2 days.\nNumerical calculations with a detailed stellar evolution code were used to\ntrace the mass-transfer phase in ~ 400 close LMXB systems with different\ninitial values of donor star mass, NS mass, orbital period and the so-called\ngamma-index of magnetic braking. Subsequently, we followed the orbital and the\ninterior evolution of the detached low-mass (proto) He WDs, including stages\nwith residual shell hydrogen burning. We find that a severe fine-tuning is\nnecessary to reproduce the observed MSPs in tight binaries with He WD\ncompanions of mass < 0.20 M_sun, which suggests that something needs to be\nmodified or is missing in the standard input physics of LMXB modelling.

The majority of these are orbiting another WD or a\nmillisecond pulsar (MSP) in a close binary system; a few examples are found to\nshow pulsations or to have a main-sequence star companion. There appear to be\ndiscrepancies between the current theoretical modelling of such low-mass He WDs\nand a number of key observed cases, indicating that their formation scenario\nremains to be fully understood. Here we investigate the formation of detached\nproto-He WDs in close-orbit low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). Our prime focus is\nto examine the thermal evolution and the contraction phase towards the WD\ncooling track and investigate how this evolution depends on the WD mass. Our\ncalculations are then compared to the most recent observational data. Numerical\ncalculations with a detailed stellar evolution code were used to trace the\nmass-transfer phase in a large number of close-orbit LMXBs. Subsequently, we\nfollowed the evolution of the detached low-mass proto-He WDs, including stages\nwith residual shell hydrogen burning and vigorous flashes caused by unstable\nCNO burning. We find that the time between Roche-lobe detachment until the\nlow-mass proto-He WD reaches the WD cooling track is typically Delta_t_proto =\n0.5 - 2 Gyr, depending systematically on the WD mass and therefore on its\nluminosity. The lowest WD mass for developing shell flashes is ~0.21 M_sun for\nprogenitor stars of mass M2 <= 1.5 M_sun (and ~0.18 M_sun for M2 = 1.6 M_sun).\nThe long timescale of low-mass proto-He WD evolution can explain a number of\nrecent observations, including some MSP systems hosting He WD companions with\nvery low surface gravities and high effective temperatures. We find no evidence\nfor Delta_t_proto to depend on the occurrence of flashes and thus question the\nsuggested dichotomy in thermal evolution of proto-WDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 21:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

The Keating model is based on atomistic modeling of elastic\ninteractions in binary alloy using harmonic springs with species dependent\nequilibrium lengths. It is demonstrated that the continuum limit for the strain\nfield are the usual equations of linear elasticity for alloys and that they\ncorrectly capture the coarse-grained displacement field. In addition, it is\nestablished that Euler-Lagrange equation of the continuum limit of the elastic\nenergy will yield the same strain field equation. However, a direct calculation\nof the elastic energy of the atomistic model reveals that the continuum\nexpression for the elastic energy is both qualitatively and quantitatively\nincorrect. This is because it does not take atomistic scale compositional\nnon-uniformity into account. Importantly, we also shows that finely mixed\nalloys tend to have more elastic energy than segregated systems, which is the\nopposite of predictions by some continuum theories. It is also shown that for\nstrained thin films the traditionally used effective misfit for alloys\nsystematically underestimate the strain energy. In some models, this drawback\nis handled by including an elastic contribution to the enthalpy of mixing which\nis characterized in terms of the continuum concentration. The direct\ncalculation of the atomistic model reveals that this approach suffers serious\ndifficulties. It is demonstrated that elastic contribution to the enthalpy of\nmixing is non-isotropic and scale dependent.

The primary\nmechanism for demand management in the US is demand response (DR) programs that\nattempt to reduce or shift demand by giving incentives to participating\ncustomers via price discounts or rebate payments. Utilities that offer DR\nprograms rely on automated DR devices (ADRs) to automate the response to DR\nsignals. The ADRs are faulty; but the working state of the ADR is not directly\nobservable --one can, however, attempt to infer it from the power consumption\nduring DR events. The utility loses revenue when a malfunctioning ADR does not\nrespond to a DR signal; however, sending a maintenance crew to check and reset\nthe ADR also incurs costs. In this paper, we show that the problem of\nmaintaining a pool of ADRs using a limited number of maintenance crews can be\nformulated as a restless bandit problem, and that one can compute a\nnear-optimal policy for this problem using Whittle indices.

Considering a codebook\nbased beamforming system (e.g., to facilitate limited feedback), we observe\nthat the complexity of \\emph{jointly} optimizing the beamforming directions\nacross the multiple arrays is highly prohibitive, even for very reasonable\nsystem parameters. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop reduced complexity\nalgorithms for optimizing the choice of beamforming directions, premised on the\nsparse multipath structure of the mmwave channel. Specifically, we reduce the\ncardinality of the joint beamforming search space, by restricting attention to\na small set of dominant candidate directions.

For $0 < r\n\\lesssim 0.55$, by contrast, the local charge susceptibility shows no\ndivergence at the QCP, but rather exhibits nonanalytic corrections to a regular\nleading behavior. Both the charge critical exponents and the previously\nobtained spin critical exponents satisfy a set of scaling relations derived\nfrom an ansatz for the free energy near the QCP. These critical exponents can\nall be expressed in terms of just two underlying exponents: the\ncorrelation-length exponent $\\nu(r)$ and the gap exponent $\\Delta(r)$. The\nansatz predicts a divergent local charge susceptibility for $\\nu<2$, which\ncoincides closely with the observed range $0.55\\lesssim r<1$. Many of these\nresults are argued to generalize to interacting QCPs that have been found in\nother quantum impurity models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 06:01:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jan 2015 20:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-16"}

A large cloud was observed for the first\ntime above Titan's southern pole in May 2012, at an altitude of 300 km. This\naltitude previously showed a temperature maximum and condensation was not\nexpected for any of Titan's atmospheric gases. Here we show that this cloud is\ncomposed of micron-sized hydrogen cyanide (HCN) ice particles. The presence of\nHCN particles at this altitude, together with new temperature determinations\nfrom mid-infrared observations, indicate a very dramatic cooling of Titan's\natmosphere inside the winter polar vortex in early 2012. Such a cooling is\ncompletely contrary to previously measured high-altitude warming in the polar\nvortex, and temperatures are a hundred degrees colder than predicted by\ncirculation models. Besides elucidating the nature of Titan's mysterious polar\ncloud, these results thus show that post-equinox cooling at the winter pole is\nmuch more efficient than previously thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 07:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The early-type binary MY Cam belongs to the young open cluster\nAlicante 1, embedded in Cam OB3. Aims. MY Cam consists of two early-O type\nmain-sequence stars and shows a photometric modulation suggesting an orbital\nperiod slightly above one day. We intend to confirm this orbital period and\nderive orbital and stellar parameters. Methods. Timing analysis of a very\nexhaustive (4607 points) light curve indicates a period of 1.1754514 +-\n0.0000015 d. High- resolution spectra and the cross-correlation technique\nimplemented in the TODCOR program were used to derive radial velocities and\nobtain the corresponding radial velocity curves for MY Cam. Modelling with the\nstellar atmosphere code FASTWIND was used to obtain stellar parameters and\ncreate templates for cross-correlation. Stellar and orbital parameters were\nderived using the Wilson-Devinney code, such that a complete solution to the\nbinary system could be described. Results. The determined masses of the primary\nand secondary stars in MY Cam are 37.7 +- 1.6 and 31.6 +- 1.4 Msol,\nrespectively. The corresponding temperatures, derived from the model atmosphere\nfit, are 42 000 and 39 000 K, with the more massive component being hotter.\nBoth stars are overfilling their Roche lobes, sharing a common envelope.\nConclusions. MY Cam contains the most massive dwarf O-type stars found so far\nin an eclipsing binary. Both components are still on the main sequence, and\nprobably not far from the zero-age main sequence.

Using far UV\nspectra and slit-jaw images from IRIS and coronal images and magnetograms from\nSDO, we investigated the evolution of two crossing loops in an active region,\nin particular, the properties of the Si IV line profile in cool loops. Results.\nIn the early stage two cool loops cross each other and accordingly have mutual\nhelicity. The Doppler shifts in the loops indicate that they wind around each\nother. As a consequence, near the crossing point of the loops (interchange)\nreconnection sets in, which heats the plasma. This is consistent with the\nobserved increase of the line width and of the appearance of the loops at\nhigher temperatures. After this interaction, the two new loops run in parallel,\nand in one of them shows a clear spectral tilt of the Si IV line profile.

Group averaging over these\nrotations yields our first proposal for spherical symmetry.

A second proposal consists in implementing\nthe vanishing of a certain vector field in spherical symmetry as a constraint\non the full Hilbert space, leading to a close analogue of diffeomorphisms\ninvariant states. While this second set of spherically symmetric states does\nnot allow for using the full Hamiltonian, it is naturally suited to implement\nthe spherically symmetric midisuperspace Hamiltonian, as an operator in the\nfull theory, on it.

Therefore, a hybrid SDN/OSPF\noperation remains a desirable proposition. In this paper, we propose a new\nmethod of hybrid SDN/OSPF operation. Our method is different from other hybrid\napproaches, as it uses SDN nodes to partition an OSPF domain into sub-domains\nthereby achieving the traffic engineering capabilities comparable to full SDN\noperation. We place SDN-enabled routers as sub-domain border nodes, while the\noperation of the OSPF protocol continues unaffected. In this way, the SDN\ncontroller can tune routing protocol updates for traffic engineering purposes\nbefore they are flooded into sub-domains. While local routing inside\nsub-domains remains stable at all times, inter-sub-domain routes can be\noptimized by determining the routes in each traversed sub-domain. As the\nmajority of traffic in non-trivial topologies has to traverse multiple\nsub-domains, our simulation results confirm that a few SDN nodes allow traffic\nengineering up to a degree that renders full SDN deployment unnecessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 12:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

The study of the\nprocess $B \\rightarrow J/\\psi \\phi K$ will be presented, and the search for the\nresonant states X(4140) and X(4270) in their decays to $J/\\psi \\phi$, will be\nhighlighted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 13:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

An important class of molecular\ncommunication systems is based on the timing channel, where information is\nencoded in the delay of the transmitted molecule---a synchronous approach. At\npresent, a widely used modeling assumption is the perfect synchronization\nbetween the transmitter and the receiver. Unfortunately, this assumption is\nunlikely to hold in most practical molecular systems. To remedy this, we\nintroduce a clock into the model---leading to the molecular timing channel with\nsynchronization error. To quantify the behavior of this new system, we derive\nupper and lower bounds on the variance-constrained capacity, which we view as\nthe step between the mean-delay and the peak-delay constrained capacity. By\nnumerically evaluating our bounds, we obtain a key practical insight: the drift\nvelocity of the clock links does not need to be significantly larger than the\ndrift velocity of the information link, in order to achieve the\nvariance-constrained capacity with perfect synchronization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 14:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

In\nthis paper, we propose three strategies to cope with this problem to facilitate\nreliable molecular communication links: communicate from the outskirts; build\nit in; and leave a small footprint. Our strategies---inspired by communication\nin natural biological systems---provide a classification to guide the design of\nmolecular communication mechanisms in synthetic biological systems.

We also\ncompute age and heavy element abundances from the properties of host stars,\ngiven in the TEPCat catalogue (Southworth 2011). The metallicity given in the\nliterature is as [Fe/H]. However, the most abundant element is oxygen, and\nthere is a reverse relation between the observed abundances [Fe/H] and [O/Fe].\nTherefore, we first compute [O/H] from [Fe/H] by using observed abundances, and\nthen find heavy element abundance from [O/H]. We also develop a new method for\nage determination. Using the ages we find, we analyse variation of both radius\nand mass of the planets with respect to time, and estimate the initial mass of\nthe planets from the relation we derive for the first time. According to our\nresults, the highly irradiated gas giants lose 5 per cent of their mass in\nevery 1 Gyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 14:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We also answer in the affirmative a question of\nGoerss and Hopkins by showing that the obstruction theory for operadic algebras\nin spectra can be done in the generality of spectra in an (essentially)\narbitrary model category. We construct strictly commutative simplicial ring\nspectra representing a given cohomology theory and illustrate this with a\nstrictly commutative motivic ring spectrum representing higher order products\non Deligne cohomology.\n  These results are obtained by first establishing Smith's stable positive\nmodel structure for abstract spectra and then showing that this category of\nspectra possesses excellent model-theoretic properties: we show that all\ncolored symmetric operads in symmetric spectra valued in a symmetric monoidal\nmodel category are admissible, i.e., algebras over such operads carry a model\nstructure. This generalizes the known model structures on commutative ring\nspectra and E-infinity ring spectra in simplicial sets or motivic spaces.

This\nsurvey, carried out during 12 nights, comprises about 100 stars. For each star,\nwe obtained typically three OBs and we searched for circumstellar emission\nbased on the measurement of squared visibilities at short baselines. A drop in\nthe measured visibilities with respect to the expected photospheric visibility\nindicates the presence of resolved emission around the target star.

We also aim to reveal\nnew companions that do not necessarily produce a significant signature in the\nsquared visibilities, as the signature of the companion may show up more\nprominently in the closure phases. In this process, we reveal four new stellar\ncompanions with contrasts ranging from 2% to 95% (i.e., up to equal flux\nbinaries).

Despite a plethora of researches discussing the morphologies of\nEBs, there has been a limited investigation of how these events appear at the\nlimb, specifically, whether they manifest as vertical extensions away from the\ndisc. In this article, we make use of high-resolution, high-cadence\nobservations of an AR at the solar limb, collected by the CRISP instrument, to\nidentify EBs and infer their physical properties. The upper atmosphere is also\nprobed using the SDO/AIA. We analyse 22 EB events evident within these data,\nfinding that 20 appear to follow a parabolic path away from the solar surface\nat an average speed of 9 km s^(-1), extending away from their source by 580 km,\nbefore retreating back at a similar speed. These results show strong evidence\nof vertical motions associated with EBs, possibly explaining the dynamical\n`flaring' (changing in area and intensity) observed in on-disc events. Two\nin-depth case studies are also presented which highlight the unique dynamical\nnature of EBs within the lower solar atmosphere. The viewing angle of these\nobservations allows for a direct linkage between these EBs and other\nsmall-scale events in the H-alpha line wings, including a potential flux\nemergence scenario. The findings presented here suggest that EBs could have a\nwider-reaching influence on the solar atmosphere than previously thought, as we\nreveal a direct linkage between EBs and an emerging small-scale loop, and other\nnear-by small-scale explosive events. However, as previous research found,\nthese extensions do not appear to impact upon the H-alpha line core, and are\nnot observed by the SDO/AIA EUV filters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 15:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Latent\nand immune periods are assumed to be constant and the infection rate is assumed\nto be proportional to I (t) N(t), where N (t) is the size of the total\npopulation and I(t) is the size of the infected population. A node recovers\nfrom an infection temporarily with a probability p and dies from the infection\nwith probability (1-p).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 15:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

The Stueckelberg trick of\nintroducing an auxiliary field along with a local symmetry in the initial\nLagrangian is used to convert the second-class constraints present in the\ninitial Lagrangian to first-class ones. An additional deformation is employed\nin the resulting Lagrangian to handle properly the first-class constraints, and\nthe equivalence with the initial model is demonstrated using the BRST\ninvariance of the deformed Lagrangian. The framework for performing\nperturbation theory is constructed and the structure of the Fock space is\ndiscussed. Despite the presence of ghost and tachyon modes in the spectrum of\nthe theory, it is shown that one can implement consistent conditions to define\na unitary and stable reduced Fock space. Within the restricted Fock space, the\nfree model turns out to be equivalent to the Maxwell electrodynamics in the\ntemporal gauge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 19:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2014 21:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Though numerous recent researches have\nreported apparent correlations between solar activity and the Earth's climate,\nsolar activity has encountered a big problem when describing the rapid global\nwarming after 1970s. Our investigation shows the good positive correlations\nbetween the Earth's surface Ultraviolet irradiance (280-400 nm) and the Earth's\nsurface temperature both in temporal and spatial variations by analyzing the\nglobal surface Ultraviolet irradiance (280-400 nm) and global surface\ntemperature data from 1980-1999. The rise of CO$_2$ cannot interpret the good\npositive correlations, and we could even get an opposite result to the good\ncorrelations when employing the rise of CO$_2$ to describe the relation between\nthem. Based on the good positive correlations, we suggest a new effect, named\n\"Highly Excited Water Vapor\" (HEWV) effect, which can interpret how the Sun\ninfluences the Earth's surface temperature reasonably, including the rapid\nwarming after 1970s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 05:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

Based on this presupposition the\ncorresponding expressions for the field operators, the eigenstates and the path\nintegral formula are determined. The nonlocal quantization principle also leads\nto a generalized propagator. If the dependence of the commutator between\noperators on different space-time points on the distance of these points is\nassumed to be described by a Gaussian function, one obtains that the propagator\nis damped by an exponential. This leads to a disappearance of UV divergences.\nThe transfer of the nonlocal quantization principle to canonical quantum\ngravity is considered as well. In this case the commutator has to be assumed to\ndepend also on the gravitational field, since the distance between two points\ndepends on the metric field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 15:09:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2016 14:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-02"}
