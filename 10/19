Our method bypasses commonly\nused control-theoretical techniques, and easily imposes necessary conditions on\ntime-optimal sequences. In a straightforward fashion, we prove that\ntime-optimal sequences are solely parametrized by three rotation angles and\nderive general bounds on those angles as a function of the relative rotation\nspeed of each control and the angle between the axes. Results are substantially\ndifferent whether both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations about the given\naxes are allowed, or only clockwise rotations. In the first case, we prove that\nany finite time-optimal sequence is composed at most of five control\nconcatenations, while for the more restrictive case, we present scaling laws on\nthe maximum length of any finite time-optimal sequence. The bounds we find for\nboth cases are stricter than previously published ones and severely constrain\nthe structure of time-optimal sequences, allowing for an efficient numerical\nsearch of the time-optimal solution. Our results can be used to find the\ntime-optimal evolution of qubit systems under the action of the considered\ncontrol set, and thus potentially increase the number of realizable unitaries\nbefore decoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2014 16:15:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

Raman spectra reveal that the local structure deviates from the\naverage structure in both ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. We show that\nthe crystal possesses several, inequivalent complex domain boundaries which\nshow no sign of instability even 200 K above the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric\nphase transition temperature TC. Two types of boundaries are addressed. The\nfirst boundary was formed between ferroelectric domains below TC. This boundary\nremained stable up to the highest measurement temperatures, and stabilized the\ndomains so that they had the same orientation after repeated heating and\ncooling cycles. These domains transformed normally to the cubic paraelectric\nphase. Another type of boundary was formed at 673 K and exhibited no signs of\ninstability up to 923 K. The boundary formation was reversible: it formed and\nvanished between 573 and 673 K during heating and cooling, respectively. A\nmodel in which the crystal is divided into thin slices with different Zr/Ti\nratios is proposed. The physical mechanism behind the thermal-stress-induced\nstructural changes is related to the different thermal expansion of the slices,\nwhich forces the domain to grow similarly after each heating and cooling cycle.\nThe results are interesting for non-volatile memory development, as it implies\nthat the original ferroelectric state can be restored after the material has\nbeen transformed to the paraelectric phase. It also suggests that a\nlow-symmetry structure, stable up to high-temperatures, can be prepared through\ncontrolled deposition of layers with desired compositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2014 17:06:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

To counter these limitations, we\nintroduce the concept of \"evolvability signatures\", which picture the\npost-mutation statistical distribution of both behavior diversity (how\ndifferent are the robot behaviors after a mutation?) and fitness values (how\ndifferent is the fitness after a mutation?). We tested the relevance of this\nconcept by evolving controllers for hexapod robot locomotion using five\ndifferent genotype-to-phenotype mappings (direct encoding, generative encoding\nof open-loop and closed-loop central pattern generators, generative encoding of\nneural networks, and single-unit pattern generators (SUPG)). We observed a\npredictive relationship between the evolvability signature of each encoding and\nthe number of generations required by hexapods to adapt from incurred damages.\nOur study also reveals that, across the five investigated encodings, the SUPG\nscheme achieved the best evolvability signature, and was always foremost in\nrecovering an effective gait following robot damages. Overall, our evolvability\nsignatures neatly complement existing task-performance benchmarks, and pave the\nway for stronger foundations for research in evolutionary robotics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2014 18:16:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2015 13:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-31"}

For these systems of difference equations, we discuss the\ninitial value problem and, moreover, we consider their integrable reductions.\nFurthermore, the derivation of the Darboux matrices gives rise to many\ninteresting objects, such as B\\\"acklund transformations for the corresponding\npartial differential equations as well as symmetries and conservation laws of\ntheir associated systems of difference equations.\n  Moreover, we employ these Darboux matrices to construct six-dimensional\nYang-Baxter maps for all the afore-mentioned cases. These maps can be\nrestricted to four-dimensional Yang-Baxter maps on invariant leaves, which are\ncompletely integrable; we also consider their vector generalisations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2014 22:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}

Each user is associated with a\nuser-centric cluster of BSs; the central processor shares the user's data with\nthe BSs in the cluster, which then cooperatively serve the user through joint\nbeamforming. Under this setup, this paper investigates the user scheduling, BS\nclustering and beamforming design problem from a network utility maximization\nperspective. Differing from previous works, this paper explicitly considers the\nper-BS backhaul capacity constraints. We formulate the network utility\nmaximization problem for the downlink C-RAN under two different models\ndepending on whether the BS clustering for each user is dynamic or static over\ndifferent user scheduling time slots. In the former case, the user-centric BS\ncluster is dynamically optimized for each scheduled user along with the\nbeamforming vector in each time-frequency slot, while in the latter case the\nuser-centric BS cluster is fixed for each user and we jointly optimize the user\nscheduling and the beamforming vector to account for the backhaul constraints.\nIn both cases, the nonconvex per-BS backhaul constraints are approximated using\nthe reweighted l1-norm technique. This approximation allows us to reformulate\nthe per-BS backhaul constraints into weighted per-BS power constraints and\nsolve the weighted sum rate maximization problem through a generalized weighted\nminimum mean square error approach. This paper shows that the proposed dynamic\nclustering algorithm can achieve significant performance gain over existing\nnaive clustering schemes. This paper also proposes two heuristic static\nclustering schemes that can already achieve a substantial portion of the gain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 2014 01:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}

To\nestimate $\\hbx$, a typical method is to solve a box-constrained integer least\nsquares (BILS) problem. However, due to its high complexity, the\nbox-constrained Babai integer point $\\x^\\sBB$ is commonly used as a suboptimal\nsolution. In this paper, we first derive formulas for the success probability\n$P^\\sBB$ of $\\x^\\sBB$ and the success probability $P^\\sOB$ of the ordinary\nBabai integer point $\\x^\\sOB$ when $\\hbx$ is uniformly distributed over the\nconstraint box.

On the one hand, we show that when the noise is\nrelatively small, LLL-P always increases $P^\\sBB$ and argue why both V-BLAST\nand SQRD often increase $P^\\sBB$; and on the other hand, we show that when the\nnoise is relatively large, LLL-P always decreases $P^\\sBB$ and argue why both\nV-BLAST and SQRD often decrease $P^\\sBB$. We also derive a column permutation\ninvariant bound on $P^\\sBB$, which is an upper bound and a lower bound under\nthese two opposite conditions, respectively.

In this paper, we study the\nproblem of sparse signal recovery when partial but partly erroneous prior\nknowledge of the signal's support is available. Based on the conventional\nsparse Bayesian learning framework, we propose a modified two-layer\nGaussian-inverse Gamma hierarchical prior model and, moreover, an improved\nthree-layer hierarchical prior model.

A natural high-dimensional extension of the classical sample correlation\nmatrix, namely block correlation matrix, is raised for this purpose. We then\nconstruct the so-called Schott type statistic as our test statistic, which\nturns out to be a particular linear spectral statistic of the block correlation\nmatrix. Interestingly, the limiting behavior of the Schott type statistic can\nbe figured out with the aid of the Free Probability Theory and the Random\nMatrix Theory.
