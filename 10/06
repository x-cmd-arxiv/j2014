This leads one to infer that\nseparability and classicality are two different concepts. These concepts are\nexamined here in the framework of a criterion for identifying classicality of a\nsystem of spin-1/2s based on the concept of joint quasiprobability (JQP) for\nthe eigevalues of spin components. The said criterion identifies a state as\nclassical if a suitably defined JQP of the eigenvalues of spin components in\nsuitably chosen three or two orthogonal directions is non-negative. In\nagreement with other approaches, the JQP based criterion leads to the result\nthat all non-factorizable pure states of two spin-1/2s are non-classical.\nFurthermore, the validity of the criterion is confirmed by comparing its\npredictions with those arrived at by other methods when applied to several\nmixed states of two spin-1/2s and the Werner like state of three spin-1/2s\n(G.Toth and A.Acin,Phys.Rev. A74, 030306(R) (2006)). The JQP based approach,\nformulated as it is along the lines of the P-function approach for identifying\nclassical states of the electromagnetic field, offers a unified approach for\nsystems of arbitrary number of spin-1/2s and the possibility of linking\nclassicality with the nature of the measurement process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 06:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

It allows to treat in a unified way examples arising in totally\ndifferent situations.\n  I discuss the particular cases of zero loci of sections in globally generated\nvector bundles, on one hand, and sources of multiplicative group actions\n(corresponding to Bialynicki-Birula decompositions), on the other hand.\nFinally, I elaborate on the symplectic and orthogonal Grassmannians; I prove\nthat the splitting of any vector bundle on them can be read off from the\nrestriction to a low dimensional `sub'-Grassmannian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Oct 2014 20:10:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 17:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

We find a non-monotonic variation of the hairpin closing\ntime with temperature, in agreement with the experimental work of Wallace et\nal. [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 2001, 98, 5584-5589]. The hairpin closing\nprocess involves the formation of an initial nucleus of one or two bonds\nbetween the stems followed by a rapid zippering of the stem. At high\ntemperatures, typically above the hairpin melting temperature, an effective\nnegative activation enthalpy is observed because the nucleus has a lower\nenthalpy than the open state. By contrast, at low temperatures, the activation\nenthalpy becomes positive mainly due to the increasing energetic cost of\nbending a loop that becomes increasingly highly stacked as the temperature\ndecreases. We show that stacking must be very strong to induce this\nexperimentally observed behavior, and that the existence of just a few weak\nstacking points along the loop can substantially suppress it.

It is used to reveal natural divisions that exist\nwithin real world networks without imposing prior size or cardinality\nconstraints on the set of communities. Despite its potential for application,\nthere is only limited support for community detection on large-scale parallel\ncomputers, largely owing to the irregular and inherently sequential nature of\nthe underlying heuristics. In this paper, we present parallelization heuristics\nfor fast community detection using the Louvain method as the serial template.\nThe Louvain method is an iterative heuristic for modularity optimization.\nOriginally developed by Blondel et al. in 2008, the method has become\nincreasingly popular owing to its ability to detect high modularity community\npartitions in a fast and memory-efficient manner. However, the method is also\ninherently sequential, thereby limiting its scalability. Here, we observe\ncertain key properties of this method that present challenges for its\nparallelization, and consequently propose heuristics that are designed to break\nthe sequential barrier. For evaluation purposes, we implemented our heuristics\nusing OpenMP multithreading, and tested them over real world graphs derived\nfrom multiple application domains (e.g., internet, citation, biological).\nCompared to the serial Louvain implementation, our parallel implementation is\nable to produce community outputs with a higher modularity for most of the\ninputs tested, in comparable number or fewer iterations, while providing\nabsolute speedups of up to 16x using 32 threads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 01:54:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 01:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

We investigate the impact of different\nhalo merger trees on a semi-analytic model.

The star formation history of the Universe and the properties of\nsatellite galaxies can show marked differences between trees with different\nconstruction methods. Independently calibrating the semi-analytic model for\neach tree can reduce the discrepancies between the z=0 global galaxy\nproperties, at the cost of increasing the differences in the evolutionary\nhistories of galaxies. Furthermore, the underlying physics implied can vary,\nresulting in key quantities such as the supernova feedback efficiency differing\nby factors of 2. Such a change alters the regimes where star formation is\nprimarily suppressed by supernovae.

Pairing\ncorrelations tend to make the large-amplitude nuclear collective motion more\nadiabatic by reducing the effect of those configuration changes. Competition\nbetween pairing and level crossing is thus expected to have a profound impact\non spontaneous fission lifetimes. To elucidate the role of nucleonic pairing on\nspontaneous fission, we study the dynamic fission trajectories of $^{264}$Fm\nand $^{240}$Pu using the state-of-the-art self-consistent framework. We employ\nthe superfluid nuclear density functional theory with the Skyrme energy density\nfunctional SkM$^*$ and a density-dependent pairing interaction. Along with\nshape variables, proton and neutron pairing correlations are taken as\ncollective coordinates. The collective inertia tensor is calculated within the\nnonperturbative cranking approximation. The fission paths are obtained by using\nthe least action principle in a four-dimensional collective space of shape and\npairing coordinates. Pairing correlations are enhanced along the minimum-action\nfission path. For the symmetric fission of $^{264}$Fm, where the effect of\ntriaxiality on the fission barrier is large, the geometry of fission pathway in\nthe space of shape degrees of freedom is weakly impacted by pairing. This is\nnot the case for $^{240}$Pu where pairing fluctuations restore the axial\nsymmetry of the dynamic fission trajectory. The minimum-action fission path is\nstrongly impacted by nucleonic pairing. In some cases, the dynamical coupling\nbetween shape and pairing degrees of freedom can lead to a dramatic departure\nfrom the static picture. Consequently, in the dynamical description of nuclear\nfission, particle-particle correlations should be considered on the same\nfooting as those associated with shape degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 06:37:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-09"}

Being capable of working with multiple data models at once, HistFitter\nintroduces an additional level of abstraction that allows for easy bookkeeping,\nmanipulation and testing of large collections of signal hypotheses. Finally,\nHistFitter provides a collection of tools to present results with\npublication-quality style through a simple command-line interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 07:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Several years ago, Linial and Meshulam\nhave introduced the $X_d(n,p)$ model, a probability space of $n$-vertex\n$d$-dimensional simplicial complexes, where $X_1(n,p)$ coincides with $G(n,p)$.\nWithin this model we prove a natural $d$-dimensional analog of these graph\ntheoretic phenomena. Specifically, we determine the exact threshold for the\nnonvanishing of the real $d$-th homology of complexes from $X_d(n,p)$. We also\ncompute the real Betti numbers of $X_d(n,p)$ for $p=c/n$.

Frequency regulation may be used to maintain the\npower balance at all times. As electric vehicles (EVs) become popular, they may\nbe connected to the grid to form a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system. An aggregation\nof EVs can be coordinated to provide frequency regulation services. However,\nV2G is a dynamic system where the participating EVs come and go independently.\nThus it is not easy to estimate the regulation capacities for V2G. In a\npreliminary study, we modeled an aggregation of EVs with a queueing network,\nwhose structure allows us to estimate the capacities for regulation-up and\nregulation-down, separately. The estimated capacities from the V2G system can\nbe used for establishing a regulation contract between an aggregator and the\ngrid operator, and facilitating a new business model for V2G. In this paper, we\nextend our previous development by designing a smart charging mechanism which\ncan adapt to given characteristics of the EVs and make the performance of the\nactual system follow the analytical model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 08:12:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 09:14:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 02:23:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 May 2015 05:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-06"}

The integration of PT and \\emph{information transfer} (IT) allows\nwireless PT to be realized by building on the existing infrastructure for IT\nand also leads to compact mobile designs. As a result, \\emph{simultaneous\nwireless information and power transfer} (SWIPT) has emerged to be an active\nresearch topic that is also the theme of this paper. In this paper, a practical\nSWIPT system is considered where two multi-antenna stations perform separate PT\nand IT to a multi-antenna mobile to accommodate their difference in ranges. The\nmobile dynamically assigns each antenna for either PT or IT. The antenna\npartitioning results in a tradeoff between the MIMO IT channel capacity and the\nPT efficiency. The optimal partitioning for maximizing the IT rate under a PT\nconstraint is a NP-hard integer program, and the paper proposes solving it via\nefficient greedy algorithms with guaranteed performance. To this end, the\nantenna-partitioning problem is proved to be one that optimizes a sub-modular\nfunction over a matroid constraint. This structure allows the application of\ntwo well-known greedy algorithms that yield solutions no smaller than the\noptimal one scaled by factors $(1-1/e)$ and 1/2, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 09:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

Although this has been\nsuggested already by B.G.

We also address the problem of the validity of the perturbative\napproach in finite nuclei for the total energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 09:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

It has been shown that the\nstrain-inducing size misfit between the substrate and the overlayer produces\nlong range dipole-monopole (d-m) interaction between the mobile adatoms and the\nislands. To simplify the account of the long range interactions in the KMC\nsimulations, use has been made of a modified square island model. Analytic\nformula for the interaction between the point surface monopole and the dipole\nforces has been derived and used to obtain a simple expression for the\ninteraction between the mobile adatom and the rectangular island. The d-m\ninteraction was found to be longer ranged than the conventional dipole-dipole\npotential. The narrowing of the island size distributions (ISDs) observed in\nthe simulations was shown to be a consequence of a weaker repulsion of adatoms\nfrom small islands than from large ones which led to the preferential growth of\nthe former. Furthermore, similarly to the unstrained case, the power-law\nbehavior of the average island size and of the island density on the coverage\nhas been found. In contrast to the unstrained case, the value of the scaling\nexponent was not universal but strongly dependent on the strength of the long\nrange interactions. Qualitative agreement of the simulation results with some\npreviously unexplained behaviors of experimental ISDs in the growth of\nsemiconductor quantum dots was observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 11:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In this Letter we shed more light on\nthe multi-threaded nature of spicules and their torsional component. We use\nhigh spatial, spectral and temporal resolution observations from the Swedish\n1-m Solar Telescope in the H{\\alpha} spectral line. The data targets the limb\nand we extract spectra from spicules far out from the limb to reduce the\nline-of-sight superposition effect. We discover that many spicules display very\nasymmetric spectra with some even showing multiple peaks. To quantify this\nasymmetry we use a double Gaussian fitting procedure and find an average\nvelocity difference between the single Gaussian components to be between 20-30\nkm s$^{-1}$ for a sample of 57 spicules. We observe that spicules show\nsignificant sub-structure where one spicule consists of many 'threads'.

This process is fast because delay is\npicked from Look Up Tables (LUT) rather than conventional SPICE simulations.\nBut accuracy of this method depends upon the underlying delay model with which\nLUT was characterized. Non Linear Delay Model (NLDM) based LUTs are quite\ncommon in industries. These LUT requires huge amount to time during\ncharacterization because of huge number of SPICE simulations done at arbitrary\npoints. To improve this people proposed various other delay models like\nalpha-power and piecewise linear delay models. Bulusu et al proposed Linear\nDelay Model(LDM) which reduces LUT generation time to 50 percent. LDM divides\ndelay curve w.r.t input rise time(trin) into two different region one is linear\nand other is non-linear. This boundary point between linear and non- linear\nregion was called break point (trb). Linear region will be done if we simulate\nat only two points. This advantage will be possible by having knowledge of this\nbreak point at various PVT corners. In this paper, We will analyze this break\npoint and will give a formula to find out this at various PVT corners.\nKnowledge about (trb) will restrict LUT simulations only in non-linear region\nand will help us in saving huge amount of time during LUT characterization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 12:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

As observed in [2], by combining these two results\none can relate the linear index coding problem of undirected graphs to the\ngraph homomorphism problem. In [4], a direct connection between linear index\ncoding problem and graph homomorphism problem is introduced. In contrast to the\nformer approach, the direct connection holds for digraphs as well and applies\nto any field size. More precisely, in [4], a graph family $\\{H_k^q\\}$ is\nintroduced and shown that whether or not the scalar linear index of a digraph\n$G$ is less than or equal to $k$ is equivalent to the existence of a graph\nhomomorphism from the complement of $G$ to the complement of $H_k^q$.\n  Here, we first study the structure of the digraphs $H_k^q$. Analogous to the\nresult of [2] about undirected graphs, we prove that $H_k^q$'s are vertex\ntransitive digraphs. Using this, and by applying a lemma of Hell and Nesetril\n[5], we derive a class of necessary conditions for digraphs $G$ to satisfy\n$lind_q(G)\\leq k$. Particularly, we obtain new lower bounds on $lind_q(G)$.\n  Our next result is about the computational complexity of scalar linear index\nof a digraph. It is known that deciding whether the scalar linear index of an\nundirected graph is equal to $k$ or not is NP-complete for $k\\ge 3$ and is\npolynomially decidable for $k=1,2$ [3].

With this choice of parameter ranges, big bang\nnucleosynthesis is left unchanged and gives no bound on the model. However, we\nshow that at lower temperatures when active-sterile oscillations are no longer\nmatter suppressed, sterile neutrinos are still in a collisional regime, due to\ntheir secret self-interactions. The interplay between vacuum oscillations and\ncollisions leads to a scattering-induced decoherent production of sterile\nneutrinos with a fast rate. This process is responsible for a flavor\nequilibration among the different neutrino species. We explore the effect of\nthis large sterile neutrino population on cosmological observables.

After division is completed and\nthe dividing septum is thinned, the mother cell engulfs the forespore in a slow\nprocess based on cell-wall degradation and synthesis. However, recently a new\ncell-wall independent mechanism was shown to significantly contribute, which\ncan even lead to fast engulfment in $\\sim$ 60 $%$ of the cases when the cell\nwall is completely removed. In this backup mechanism, strong ligand-receptor\nbinding between mother-cell protein SpoIIIAH and forespore-protein SpoIIQ leads\nto zipper-like engulfment, but quantitative understanding is missing. In our\nwork, we combined fluorescence image analysis and stochastic Langevin\nsimulations of the fluctuating membrane to investigate the origin of fast\nbistable engulfment in absence of the cell wall. Our cell morphologies compare\nfavorably with experimental time-lapse microscopy, with engulfment sensitive to\nthe number of SpoIIQ-SpoIIIAH bonds in a threshold-like manner. By systematic\nexploration of model parameters, we predict regions of osmotic pressure and\nmembrane-surface tension that produce successful engulfment. Indeed, decreasing\nthe medium osmolarity in experiments prevents engulfment in line with our\npredictions. Forespore engulfment may thus not only be an ideal model system to\nstudy decision-making in single cells, but its biophysical principles are\nlikely applicable to engulfment in other cell types, e.g. during phagocytosis\nin eukaryotes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 15:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We consider the limit\nof a massless trojan companion of a giant planet. Without other planets, this\nis a case of the elliptic restricted three body problem (ERTBP). The presence\nof more planets (the restricted multi-planet problem, RMPP) induces new direct\nand indirect secular effects on the trojan's dynamics. In the theoretical part\nof this paper, we develop a Hamiltonian formalism in action-angle variables,\nwhich allows to treat in a unified way resonant dynamics and secular effects on\nthe trojan body in both the ERTBP or the RMPP. Our formalism leads to a\ndecomposition of the Hamiltonian in two parts, $H=H_b+H_{sec}$. $H_b$, called\nthe basic model, describes resonant dynamics in the short-period (epicyclic)\nand synodic (libration) degrees of freedom. $H_{sec}$ contains only terms\ndepending on slow (secular) angles. $H_b$ is formally identical in the ERTBP\nand the RMPP, apart from a re-definition of angular variables. An important\nphysical consequence is that the slow chaotic diffusion proceeds in both the\nERTBP and the RMPP by a qualitatively similar dynamical mechanism better\napproximated by the paradigm of `modulational diffusion'. In the numerical\npart, we focus on the ERTBP for making a numerical demonstration of the chaotic\ndiffusion process along resonances. Using color stability maps, we provide a\nsurvey of the resonant web for characteristic mass parameters of the primary,\nin which the secondary resonances from 1:5 to 1:12 (ratio of the short over the\nsynodic period) and their resonant multiplets appear. We give numerical\nexamples of diffusion of weakly chaotic orbits in the resonant web.

On this basis, we find an\ninverse power in the energy distribution with a power law exponent of 2.701178\nin excellent agreement with the experimental value of 2.7. The heat of nuclear\nmatter evaporation via the entropy allows for the computation of the exponent.\nThe evaporation model employed is based on the entropy considerations of Landau\nand Fermi that have been applied to the liquid drop model of evaporation in a\nheavy nucleus excited by a collision. This model provides a new means of\nobtaining power law distributions for cosmic ray energy distributions and,\nremarkably, an actual value for the exponent which is in agreement with\nexperiment and explains the otherwise puzzling smoothness of the cosmic ray\nenergy distribution over a wide range of energies without discontinuities due\nto contributions from different sources required by current models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Oct 2014 17:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

For that the results of key publications\n(dealing with impact measurement) are discussed. The paper discusses how impact\nis generally measured within science and beyond (section 2), which effects\nimpact measurements have on the science system (section 3), and which problems\nare associated with impact measurement (section 4). The problems associated\nwith impact measurement constitute the focus of this paper: Science is marked\nby inequality, random chance, anomalies, the right to make mistakes,\nunpredictability, and a high significance of extreme events, which might\ndistort impact measurements.

The process of {\\it order flow imbalance} (OFI) is\nstudied. This process is a sensitive indicator of the current state of the\nlimit order book since time intervals between events in a limit order book are\nusually so short that price changes are relatively infrequent events. Therefore\nprice changes provide a very coarse and limited description of market dynamics\nat time micro-scales. The OFI process tracks best bid and ask queues and change\nmuch faster than prices.

Computer simulation models were developed to\nassess exposure of square, rectangular, pyramidal, and cylindrical water\ncontainers to microwave radiation at 300, 900, and 2,400 MHz. The development\nof the models included determination of EM field distribution and the resulting\nspecific absorption rate (SAR) in the stored water. These models employed CST\nSTUDIO SUITE 2014 package to solve EM field equations by applying the\nfinite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The effect of frequency, packaging\nshape, and polarization on SAR induced in water was determined. High electric\nfield and point SAR were obtained over the whole azimuth and elevation angles\nrange in the pyramidal container model. The highest values of SAR were induced\nin water at the sharp edges of the four water container models. The order of\nthe effect on total SAR and maximum point SAR is cylindrical < square <\nrectangular < pyramidal model at 300, 900, and 2,400 MHz for both vertical and\nhorizontal polarizations. It can be concluded that the variation in the\npackaging shape of the containers, polarization, irradiation geometry, and\nfrequency.
