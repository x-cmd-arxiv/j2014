The images and spectra unveil two\ndiffuse blobs, one of them located at 55 arcsec from the central star along the\nNE direction (PA= +71) and the other at 78 arcsec in the SW direction (PA=\n-151). Therefore, these structures do not share the symmetry axes of the inner\nbipolar outflows. Their radial velocities relative to the system are quite low:\n+3 and -4 km/s, respectively. Spectroscopic data confirm a high [O III] to Ha\nratio, indicating that the blobs are being excited by the UV flux from the\ncentral star. Our images convincingly show a spherical halo 60 arcsec in\ndiameter encircling the quadrupolar nebula. The expansion velocity of this\nshell is low, 66 km/s. The software SHAPE has been used to construct a\nmorpho-kinematic model for the ring and the bipolar flows that implies an age\nof 4,000 yrs, the expansion of the halo sets a lower limit for its age 46,000\nyrs, and the very low expansion of the blobs suggests they are part of a large\nstructure corresponding to a mass ejection that took place 150,000 yrs ago.

Serious challenges remain in producing and\ndetecting long-range quantum correlations in these systems, however.

Models in which the components change their\nhomogeneity at different times are of significant importance. The fact whether\nany changes are influential for the whole process is determined not only by the\nmoments of the change, but also depends on which coordinates. This is\nparticularly important in issues such as reliability analysis of complex\nsystems and the location of an intruder in surveillance systems. In this paper\nwe developed a mathematical model for such sources of signals with discrete\ntime having the Markov property given the times of change. The research also\ncomprises a multivariate detection of the transition probabilities changes at\ncertain sensitivity level in the multidimensional process. Additionally, the\nobservation of the random vector is depicted. Each chosen coordinate forms the\nMarkov process with different transition probabilities before and after some\nunknown moment. The aim of statisticians is to estimate the moments based on\nthe observation of the process.

Except for a few papers on energy\nminimization, there is no work in the scheduling literature that uses\nperformance metrics depending on the gap structure of a schedule. One of our\nobjectives is to initiate the study of such scheduling problems with gaps. We\nshow that such problems often lead to interesting algorithmic problems, with\nconnections to other areas of algorithmics. We focus on the model with unit\njobs. First we examine scheduling problems with deadlines, where we consider\nvariants of minimum-gap scheduling, including maximizing throughput with a\nbudget for gaps or minimizing the number of gaps with a throughput requirement.\nWe then turn to other objective functions. For example, in some scenarios, gaps\nin a schedule may be actually desirable, leading to the problem of maximizing\nthe number of gaps. Other versions we study include minimizing maximum gap or\nmaximizing minimum gap. The second part of the paper examines the model without\ndeadlines, where we focus on the tradeoff between the number of gaps and the\ntotal or maximum flow time. For all these problems we provide polynomial time\nalgorithms, with running times ranging from $O(n \\log n)$ for some problems, to\n$O(n^7)$ for other. The solutions involve a spectrum of algorithmic techniques,\nincluding different dynamic programming formulations, speed-up techniques based\non searching Monge arrays, searching X + Y matrices, or implicit binary search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Oct 2014 22:07:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2020 14:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 16:25:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 18:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

In\nhigh latitudes a positive correlation $\\langle v'_rv'_\\theta\\rangle$ is induced\nin the NSSL by the poleward meridional flow whose amplitude increases with the\nradius, while a negative correlation is generated by the Coriolis force in bulk\nof the convection zone.

For this purpose, we employ an oriented Gaussian domain kernel\nlocally controlled by a structure tensor. The oriented domain kernel combined\nwith a range kernel forms the directional bilateral filter.

This study presents a parameterisation called `phytoconvection' which\nfocuses on the influence of convection on primary production. This\nparameterisation was implemented into a three-dimensional\nphysical-biogeochemical model and applied to the Northwestern European\nContinental Shelf and areas of the adjacent Northeast Atlantic. The simulation\nwas compared to a `conventional' parameterisation with respect to its influence\non phytoplankton concentrations during the annual cycle and its effect on the\ncarbon cycle. The simulation using the new parameterisation showed good\nagreement with observation data recorded during winter, whereas the reference\nsimulation did not capture the observed phytoplankton concentrations. The new\nparameterisation had a strong influence on the carbon export through the\nsinking of particulate organic carbon. The carbon export during late\nwinter/early spring significantly exceeded the export of the reference run.\nFurthermore, a non-hydrostatic convection model was used to evaluate the major\nassumption of the presented parameterisation which implies the matching of the\nmixed layer depth with the convective mixing depth. The applied mixed layer\ndepth criterion principally overestimates the actual convective mixing depth.\nHowever, the results showed that this assumption is reasonable during late\nwinter, while indicating a mismatch during spring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 11:09:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2014 10:14:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-06"}

In contrast to other materials\n(e.g., silicates) water ice is assumed to be stickier due to its higher\nspecific surface energy, leading to faster or more efficient growth in mutual\ncollisions. However, experiments investigating the stickiness of water ice have\nbeen scarce, particularly in the astrophysically relevant micrometer-size\nregion and at low temperatures. In this work, we present an experimental setup\nto grow aggregates composed of $\\mathrm{\\mu}$m-sized water-ice particles, which\nwe used to measure the sticking and erosion thresholds of the ice particles at\ndifferent temperatures between $114 \\, \\mathrm{K}$ and $260 \\, \\mathrm{K}$. We\nshow with our experiments that for low temperatures (below $\\sim 210 \\,\n\\mathrm{K}$), $\\mathrm{\\mu}$m-sized water-ice particles stick below a threshold\nvelocity of $9.6 \\, \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}}$, which is approximately ten times\nhigher than the sticking threshold of $\\mathrm{\\mu}$m-sized silica particles.\nFurthermore, erosion of the grown ice aggregates is observed for velocities\nabove $15.3 \\, \\mathrm{m \\, s^{-1}}$. A comparison of the experimentally\nderived sticking threshold with model predictions is performed to determine\nimportant material properties of water ice, i.e., the specific surface energy\nand the viscous relaxation time. Our experimental results indicate that the\npresence of water ice in the outer reaches of protoplanetary disks can enhance\nthe growth of planetesimals by direct sticking of particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 12:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In this paper, we first prove a theorem derived from\nthe first law of black hole thermodynamics and a mathematical lemma related to\nthe Vandermonde determinant. With these arguments, we develop some general\ncriterion for the mass independence of the entropy product as well as the\nentropy sum. In particular, if a $d$-dimensional spacetime is spherically\nsymmetric and its radial metric function $f(r)$ is a Laurent series in $r$ with\nthe lowest power $-m$ and the highest power $n$, we find the criteria is\nextremely simple: The entropy product is mass independent if and only if $m\\geq\nd-2$ and $n\\geq4-d$. The entropy sum is mass independent if and only if $m\\geq\nd-2$ and $n\\geq 2$.

While\nsome collective groups use a single organizing principle, others can\ndynamically shift the behavior of the group by modifying the interaction rules\nat the individual level. The surface-dwelling bacterium Myxococcus xanthus\nforms dynamic collective groups both to feed on prey and to aggregate during\ntimes of starvation. The latter behavior, termed fruiting-body formation,\ninvolves a complex, coordinated series of density changes that ultimately lead\nto three-dimensional aggregates comprising hundreds of thousands of cells and\nspores. This multi-step developmental process most likely involves several\ndifferent single-celled behaviors as the population condenses from a loose,\ntwo-dimensional sheet to a three-dimensional mound. Here, we use\nhigh-resolution microscopy and computer vision software to spatiotemporally\ntrack the motion of thousands of individuals during the initial stages of\nfruiting body formation.

In this way the porous medium has a\ncontinuum description, and can be specified without the need of a detailed\nknowledge of the pore microstructure by indipendently assigning permeability\nand porosity. At the interface between the porous material and the fluid\nregion, momentum-transfer conditions are applied, in which an available\ncoefficient related to the unknown structure of the interface can be used as an\nerror estimate.

We\nprove that even the case of one processor and unit-length jobs does not admit a\npseudo-polynomial time algorithm unless SAT can be solved by a randomized\nmethod in expected quasi-polynomial time. This result also extends to the case\nof inexact periods, which answers a question that has remained open for more\nthan two decades. Furthermore, we report an error found in a hardness proof\npreviously given for the multi-machine case without machine migration, and we\nshow that this variant reduces to the single-machine case. Finally, we prove\nthat even with unit-length jobs the problem is co-NP-hard when jobs are allowed\nto migrate between machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 13:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-28"}

This problem is\nrelevant to critical applications that rely on the combination of the opinions\nof multiple peers to provide a service. Examples include monitoring a content\nsource to prevent equivocation or to track variability in the content provided,\nand resolving divergent state amongst the nodes of a distributed system.\nPrevious works assume a fully synchronous system, where one can make strong\nassumptions such as negligible message delivery delays and/or detection of\nabsent messages. However, practical, real-world systems are mostly\nasynchronous, i.e., they exhibit only some periods of synchrony during which\nmessage delivery is timely, thus requiring a different approach.

We compute several models of chemical evolution using the metallicity\ndistribution of dwarf stars as an observational constraint for the bulge of\nM31. Then, by means of the model which best reproduces the metallicity\ndistribution function, we predict the [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relations for several\nchemical elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, C, N). Our best model for the bulge of M31 is\nobtained by means of a robust statistical method and assumes a Salpeter initial\nmass function, a Schmidt-Kennicutt law for star formation with an exponent\nk=1.5, an efficiency of star formation of $\\sim 15\\pm 0.27\\, Gyr^{-1}$, and an\ninfall timescale of $\\sim 0.10\\pm 0.03$Gyr. Our results suggest that the bulge\nof M31 formed very quickly by means of an intense star formation rate and an\ninitial mass function flatter than in the solar vicinity but similar to that\ninferred for the Milky Way bulge. The [$\\alpha$/Fe] ratios in the stars of the\nbulge of M31 should be high for most of the [Fe/H] range, as is observed in the\nMilky Way bulge. These predictions await future data to be proven.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 14:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The product's value\nfor a consumer is determined by two factors: a fixed consumer-specified\nintrinsic value and a variable externality that is exerted from the consumer's\nneighbors in a linear way. We study the scenario of negative externalities,\nwhich captures many interesting situations, but is much less understood in\ncomparison with its positive externality counterpart.

We propose a versatile route using\ndifferent photoactive materials, and demonstrate a multiwavelength activation\nand propulsion. Thanks to the photoelectrochemical properties of two\nsemiconductor materials (\\alpha Fe2 O3 and TiO2 ), a light with an energy\nhigher than the bandgap triggers the reaction of decomposition of hydrogen\nperoxide and produces a chemical cloud around the particle. It induces a\nphoretic attraction with neighbouring colloids as well as an osmotic self-\npropulsion of the particle on the substrate. We use these mechanisms to form\ncolloidal cargos as well as self-propelled particles where the light-activated\ncomponent is embedded into a dielectric sphere. The particles are\nself-propelled along a direction otherwise randomized by thermal fluctuations,\nand exhibit a persistent random walk. For sufficient surface density, the\nparticles spontaneously form \"living crystals\" which are mobile, break apart\nand reform. Steering the particle with an external magnetic field, we show that\nthe formation of the dense phase results from the collisions heads-on of the\nparticles. This effect is intrinsically non-equilibrium and a novel principle\nof organization for systems without detailed balance. Engineering families of\nparticles self-propelled by different wavelength demonstrate a good\nunderstanding of both the physics and the chemistry behind the system and\npoints to a general route for designing new families of self-propelled\nparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 15:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-28"}

We use a parabolic support rotating around it\naxis to study the static equilibrium positions of a single sphere. Due to the\nparticular choice of the shape of support, some easy analytical calculations\nallow theoretical predictions. (i) In the frictionless case, there is an eigen\nfrequency of rotation where the gravity balances the centrifugal force. All\npositions on the parabola are therefore in static equilibrium. At others rates\nof rotation, the sphere can go to the center or escape to infinity. It depends\nonly on the sign of the detuning with the eigenfrequency. (ii) In contrast, we\nshow that the static friction imposes a range of equilibrium positions at all\nrotating rates. These predictions can be compared to the maximum equilibrium\nradius measured on the experimental device. A reasonable estimate of the static\nfriction between the support and spheres made of different materials can be\nextracted from this maximum equilibrium radius. To go further in understanding\nof the experimental results, we perform a stability analysis also in the case\nwith friction. This analysis involves the rolling friction. We show that this\nrolling friction can be estimated in the same device just by the check the\ndissipation during the motion of the sphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 15:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}

We consider the possibility of using\nmodulated high frequency periodic driving of a two-dimension system (optical\nlattice) to simulate properties of rippled graphene. We suggest that the Dirac\nHamiltonian in a curved background space can also be effectively simulated by a\nsuitable driving scheme in optical lattice. The time dependent system yields,\nin the approximate limit of high frequency pulsing, an effective time\nindependent Hamiltonian that governs the time evolution, except for an initial\nand a final kick. We use a specific form of 4-phase pulsed forcing with\nsuitably tuned choice of modulating operators to mimic the effects of\ncurvature. The extent of curvature is found to be directly related to\n$\\omega^{-1}$ the time period of the driving field at the leading order. We\napply the method to engineer the effects of curved background space. We find\nthat the imprint of curvilinear geometry modifies the electronic properties,\nsuch as LDOS, significantly. We suggest that this method shall be useful in\nstudying the response of various properties of such systems to non-trivial\ngeometry without requiring any actual physical deformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 11:25:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 07:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

In this paper,\nwe explore some of their fundamental properties on the digital plane that have\na strong bearing on the unsupervised detection of circles and circular arcs in\na digital image. We show that although the chord-and-sagitta properties of a\nreal circle do not readily migrate to the digital plane, they can indeed be\nused for the analysis in the discrete domain based on certain bounds on their\ndeviations, which are derived from the real domain. In particular, we derive an\nupper bound on the circumferential angular deviation of a point in the context\nof chord property, and an upper bound on the relative error in radius\nestimation with regard to the sagitta property. Using these two bounds, we\ndesign a novel algorithm for the detection and parameterization of circles and\ncircular arcs, which does not require any heuristic initialization or manual\ntuning. The chord property is deployed for the detection of circular arcs,\nwhereas the sagitta property is used to estimate their centers and radii.\nFinally, to improve the accuracy of estimation, the notion of restricted Hough\ntransform is used. Experimental results demonstrate superior efficiency and\nrobustness of the proposed methodology compared to existing techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Oct 2014 17:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-07"}
