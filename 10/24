Such codes rely on the ability to extract\ninformation about the quantum error syndrome while not destroying the quantum\ninformation encoded in the system. Stabilizer codes are attractive solutions to\nthis problem, as they are analogous to classical linear codes, have simple and\neasily computed encoding networks, and allow efficient syndrome extraction. In\nthese codes, syndrome extraction is performed via multi-qubit stabilizer\nmeasurements, which are bit and phase parity checks up to local operations.\nPreviously, stabilizer codes have been realized in nuclei, trapped-ions, and\nsuperconducting qubits.

A usual two dimensional\nelectron system is assumed to have a $\\delta$ like density distribution along\nthe crystal growth direction. However, once the confining quantum well is\nsufficiently large, this situation is changed and the density can no longer be\nassumed as a $\\delta$ function. In addition, it is known that the density\nprofile is not a single peaked function, instead can present more than one\nmaxima, depending on the well width. In this work, the electron density\ndistributions in the growth direction considering a variety of wide quantum\nwells are investigated as function of temperature. We show that, the double\npeak in the density profile varies from symmetric (similar peak height) to\nasymmetric while changing the temperature for particular growth parameters. The\nalternation from symmetric to asymmetric density profiles is known to exhibit\nintriguing phase transitions and is decisive in defining the properties of the\nground state wavefunction in the presence of an external magnetic field, i.e\nfrom insulating phases to even denominator fractional quantum Hall states.\nHere, by solving the temperature and material dependent Schr\\\"odinger and\nPoisson equations self-consistently, we found that such a phase transition may\nelaborated by taking into account direct Coulomb interactions together with\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 17:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-24"}

When we allow one of the initial particles to have impact parameter $b\n> 2M$, and thus not get captured by the horizon, it is able to collide along\noutgoing trajectories, greatly increasing the chance that the products can\nescape. For equal-mass particles annihilating to photons, we find a greatly\nincreased peak energy of $E_{\\rm out} \\approx 6\\times E_{\\rm in}$.

Typically, the region\nsearch methods project the score of a classifier into an image plane, and then\nsearch the region with the maximal score. The recently proposed region search\nmethods, such as efficient subwindow search and efficient region search, %which\nlocalize objects from the score distribution on an image are much more\nefficient than sliding window search. However, for some classifiers and tasks,\nthe projected scores are nearly all positive, and hence maximizing the score of\na region results in localizing nearly the entire images as objects, which is\nmeaningless.\n  In this paper, we observe that the large scores are mainly concentrated on or\naround objects.

The region density can be controlled by a parameter flexibly.\nAnd we prove an important property of the proposed LS-MWCS, which guarantees\nthat the region with the densest score can be searched.

The\nmodel combines a weakly-coupled hard sector, involving gluon modes with energy\nand momenta of the order of the saturation momentum and relatively large\noccupation numbers, with a strongly-coupled soft sector, which physically\nrepresents the soft gluons radiated by the hard partons. The hard sector is\ndescribed by perturbative QCD, more precisely, by its semi-classical\napproximation (the classical Yang-Mills equations) which becomes appropriate\nwhen the occupation numbers are large. The soft sector is described by a\nmarginally deformed conformal field theory, which in turn admits a holographic\ndescription in terms of classical Einstein's equations in $AdS_5$ with a\nminimally coupled massless `dilaton'. The model involve two free parameters\nwhich characterize the gauge-invariant couplings between the hard and soft\nsectors. Via these couplings, the hard modes provide dynamical sources for the\ngravitational equations at the boundary of $AdS_5$ and feel the feedback of the\nlatter as additional soft sources in the classical Yang-Mills equations.\nImportantly, the initial conditions for this coupled dynamics are fully\ndetermined by the hard sector alone, i.e. by perturbative QCD, and are\nconveniently given by the color glass condensate (CGC) effective theory. We\nalso develop a new semi-holographic picture of jets in the QGP by attaching a\nnon-Abelian charge to the endpoint of the trailing string in $AdS_5$\nrepresenting a heavy quark. This leads to modified Nambu-Goto equations for the\nstring which govern the (collisional and radiative) energy loss by the heavy\nquark towards both hard and soft modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 18:41:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 14:30:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2015 16:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-10"}

In the cores of many clusters, radiative\nenergy losses from the ICM occur on timescales significantly shorter than the\nage of the system. Unchecked, this cooling would lead to massive accumulations\nof cold gas and vigorous star formation, in contradiction to observations.\nVarious sources of energy capable of compensating these cooling losses have\nbeen proposed, the most promising being heating by the supermassive black holes\nin the central galaxies through inflation of bubbles of relativistic plasma.\nRegardless of the original source of energy, the question of how this energy is\ntransferred to the ICM has remained open. Here we present a plausible solution\nto this question based on deep Chandra X-ray observatory data and a new\ndata-analysis method that enables us to evaluate directly the ICM heating rate\ndue to the dissipation of turbulence. We find that turbulent heating is\nsufficient to offset radiative cooling and indeed appears to balance it locally\nat each radius - it might therefore be the key element in resolving the gas\ncooling problem in cluster cores and, more universally, in atmospheres of X-ray\ngas-rich systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 20:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-27"}

We perform simulations using three different initial mean number\ndensities of n_0 = 30, 100 and 300 cm^{-3} to span a range of typical values\nfor dense gas clouds in the solar neighbourhood. We compute slopes of the\ncentroid velocity increment structure functions (CVISF) and of Fourier spectra\nfor different chemical components: the total density, H2 number density, 12CO\nnumber density as well as the integrated intensity of 12CO (J=1-0) and 13CO\n(J=1-0). We show that optical depth effects can significantly affect the slopes\nderived for the CVISF, which also leads to different scaling properties for the\nFourier spectra. The slopes of CVISF and Fourier spectra for H2 are\nsignificantly steeper than those for the different CO tracers, independent of\nthe density and the numerical resolution. This is due to the larger\nspace-filling factor of H2 as it is better able to self-shield in diffuse\nregions, leading to a larger fractal co-dimension compared to CO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 21:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The\nprocedure implies the addition of compensating terms to the kinetic energy, in\nsuch a way that the resulting equations of motion are valid in any frame. The\ncompensating terms provide inertial forces depending on the total momentum P,\nintrinsic angular momentum J and intrinsic inertia tensor I. Therefore, the\nprivileged frames where Newton's equations are valid (Newtonian frames) are\ncompletely determined by the matter distribution of the universe\n(Machianization). At the Hamiltonian level, the gauge invariance leads to first\nclass constraints that remove those degrees of freedom that make no sense once\nthe absolute space has been eliminated. This reformulation of classical\nmechanics is entirely relational, since it is a dynamics for the distances\nbetween particles. It is also Machian, since the rotation of the rest of the\nuniverse produces centrifugal effects. It then provides a new perspective to\nconsider the foundational ideas of general relativity, like Mach's principle\nand the weak equivalence principle. With regard to the concept of time, the\nabsence of an absolute time is known to be a characteristic of parametrized\nsystems. Furthermore, the scale invariance of those parametrized systems whose\npotentials are inversely proportional to the squared distances can be also\ngauged by introducing another compensating term associated with the intrinsic\nvirial G (shape-dynamics).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 21:27:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 21:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 13:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

This paper presents results for an unbiased Spitzer IRAC search for\ncircumstellar dust orbiting a homogeneous and well-defined sample of 134 single\nwhite dwarfs. The stars were selected without regard to atmospheric metal\ncontent but were chosen to have 1) hydrogen rich atmospheres, 2) 17 000 K <\nT_eff < 25 000 K and correspondingly young post main-sequence ages of\n15-270Myr, and 3) sufficient far-ultraviolet brightness for a corresponding\nHubble Space Telescope COS Snapshot. Five white dwarfs were found to host an\ninfrared bright dust disc, three previously known, and two reported here for\nthe first time, yielding a nominal 3.7% of white dwarfs in this post-main\nsequence age range with detectable circumstellar dust. Remarkably,\ncomplementary HST observations indicate that a fraction of 27% show metals in\ntheir photosphere that can only be explained with ongoing accretion from\ncircumstellar material, indicating that nearly 90% of discs escape detection in\nthe infrared, likely due to small emitting surface area. This paper also\npresents the distribution of disc fractional luminosity as a function of\ncooling age for all known dusty white dwarfs, suggesting possible disc\nevolution scenarios and indicating an undetected population of circumstellar\ndiscs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 23:49:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 14:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-20"}

We pose a new\nleader selection problem called the in-network leader selection problem.\nInitially, an arbitrary node is selected to be a leader, and in all consequent\nsteps the network must have exactly one leader. The agents must collaborate to\nfind the leader that minimizes the variance of the deviation from the desired\ntrajectory, and they must do so within the network using only communication\nbetween neighbors. To develop a solution for this problem, we first show a\nconnection between the leader selection problem and a class of discrete\nfacility location problems.

The dynamo generated\nmagnetic fields possesses many time scales, with a prominent polarity cycle\noccurring roughly every 6.2 years. The magnetic field forms large-scale\ntoroidal wreaths, whose formation is tied to the low Rossby number of the\nconvection in this simulation. The polarity reversals are linked to the\nweakened differential rotation and a resistive collapse of the large-scale\nmagnetic field. An equatorial migration of the magnetic field is seen, which is\ndue to the strong modulation of the differential rotation rather than a dynamo\nwave. A poleward migration of magnetic flux from the equator eventually leads\nto the reversal of the polarity of the high-latitude magnetic field.

This paper provides a numerical\napproach to understand better the dynamical behavior of an indirect field\noriented control of a current-fed induction motor. The focus is on bifurcation\nanalysis of the IFOC motor, with a particular emphasis on the change that\naffects the dynamics and stability under small variations of Proportional\nIntegral controller (PI) parameters, load torque and k, the ratio of the rotor\ntime constant and its estimate etc. Bifurcation diagrams are computed. This\npaper also attempts to discuss various types of the transition to chaos in the\ninduction motor. The results of the obtained bifurcation simulations give\nuseful guidelines for adjusting both motor model and PI controller parameters.\nIt is also important to ensure desired operation of the motor when the motor\nshows chaotic behavior. Infinite numbers of unstable periodic orbits are\nembedded in a chaotic attractor. Any unstable periodic orbit can be stabilized\nby proper control algorithm. The delayed feedback control method to control\nchaos has been implemented in this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2014 05:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-27"}

This giant arc gives a\nunique opportunity to peer into the structure of a high-redshift disk galaxy.\nWe find that the lensed galaxy of Abell 2667 is a typical spiral galaxy with\nmorphology similar to the structure of its counterparts at higher redshift\n$z\\sim 2$. The surface brightness of the reconstructed source galaxy in the\nz$_{850}$ band reveals the central surface brightness $I(0)=20.28\\pm0.22$ mag\narcsec$^{-2}$ and the characteristic radius $r_s=2.01\\pm0.16$ kpc at redshift\n$z \\sim 1$. The morphological reconstruction in different bands shows obvious\nnegative radial color gradients for this galaxy. Moreover, the redder central\nbulge tends to contain a metal-rich stellar population, rather than being\nheavily reddened by dust due to high and patchy obscuration. We analyze the\nVIMOS/IFU spectroscopic data and find that, in the given wavelength range\n($\\sim 1800-3200$ \\AA), the combined arc spectrum of the source galaxy is\ncharacterized by a strong continuum emission with strong UV absorption lines\n(FeII and MgII) and shows the features of a typical starburst Wolf-Rayet galaxy\nNGC5253.

Analysing the Prandtl number dependence of the kinetic energy\nbalance, we show that the height-dependence of the mean viscous dissipation is\nclosely related to the flux of kinetic energy. We show that the flux of kinetic\nenergy can be divided into four additive contributions, each representing a\ndifferent elementary physical process (advection, buoyancy, normal viscous\nstresses and viscous shear stresses).

While research has shown\nthat networks of interlocking directorates facilitate the transmission of\ninformation between corporations, little is known about the extent to which\nsuch interlocking networks can explain the fluctuations of stock price returns.\nYet, this is a special concern since the risk of amplifying stock fluctuations\nis latent. To answer this question, here we analyze the board composition,\ntraders' perception, and stock performance of more than 1500 US traded\ncorporations from 2007-2011. First, we find that the fewer degrees of\nseparation between two corporations in the interlocking network, the stronger\nthe temporal correlation between their stock price returns. Second, we find\nthat the centrality of traded corporations in the interlocking network\ncorrelates with the frequency at which financial traders talk about such\ncorporations, and this frequency is in turn proportional to the corresponding\ntraded volume. Third, we show that the centrality of corporations was\nnegatively associated with their stock performance in 2008, the year of the big\nfinancial crash. These results suggest that the strategic decisions made by\ninterlocking directorates are strongly followed by stock analysts and have the\npotential to correlate and amplify the movement of stock prices during\nfinancial crashes.

We analysed the\nintensity weighted H I velocity maps of the ATCA/Parkes and GASS data sets. We\ncorrected the line of sight velocity field for the systemic, transverse,\nprecession, and nutation motions of the disk using two recent proper motion\nestimates, and estimated the kinematic parameters of the H I disk. The value of\nposition angle (PA) of kinematic major axis estimated using ATCA/Parkes data is\nfound to be similar to the recent estimate of the PA using stellar tracers. The\neffect of precession and nutation in the estimation of PA is found to be\nsignificant. Using ATCA/Parkes data, most of the H I gas in the LMC is found to\nbe located in the disk. We detected 12.1% of the data points as kinematic\noutliers. We identified the well-known Arm E, Arm S, Arm W, Arm B and a new\nstream, Outer Arm, as part of outlier components. The GASS data analysis brings\nout the velocity details of the Magellanic Bridge (MB) and its connection to\nthe LMC disk. We find that the Arm B and the Outer Arm are connected to the MB.\nWe detect high velocity gas in the western disk of the LMC and the south-west\nand southern parts of the MB. We proposed two models (in plane and out of\nplane) to explain the outlier gas. We suggest that the Arm B could be an infall\nfeature, originating from the inner MB. The Arm E could be an outflow feature.\nWe suggest possible outflows from the western LMC disk and south and south\nwestern MB, which could be due to ram pressure. The velocity pattern observed\nin the MB suggests that it is being sheared. We suggest that the various\noutliers identified in this study may be caused by a combination of tidal\neffects and hydrodynamical effect due to the motion of the LMC in the Milky Way\n(MW) halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2014 11:22:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 14:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

In addition to the often considered small-scale thermal energy\ndeposition by the AGN, which is implemented in the simulation, we model\nlong-range photo-ionizing AGN radiation in post-processing, and quantify the\nimpact of AGN feedback on the ability of the gas to form stars.

Choosing the timelike\ncoordinate aligned with the khronon, the static metric takes a simple form,\nfrom which it can be seen clearly that the metric is free of singularity at the\nKilling horizon, but becomes singular at the universal horizon.

The presented methods are able to match between\ntwo user profiles from two different OSNs based on supervised learning\ntechniques, which use features extracted from each one of the user profiles. By\nusing the extracted features and supervised learning techniques, we developed\nclassifiers which can perform entity matching between two profiles for the\nfollowing scenarios: (a) matching entities across two OSNs; (b) searching for a\nuser by similar name; and (c) de-anonymizing a user's identity.\n  The constructed classifiers were tested by using data collected from two\npopular OSNs, Facebook and Xing.

The challenge\nis mainly because of quick decoherence of quantum states due to hot, wet and\nnoisy environment of the brain which forbids long life coherence for brain\nprocessing. Despite these critical discussions, there are only a few number of\npublished papers about numerical aspects of decoherence in neurons. Perhaps the\nmost important issue is offered by Max Tegmark who has calculated decoherence\ntimes for the systems of \"ions\" and \"microtubules\" in neurons of the brain. In\nfact, Tegmark did not consider ion channels which are responsible for ions\ndisplacement through the membrane and are the building blocks of electrical\nmembrane signals in the nervous system. Here, we would like to re-investigate\ndecoherence times for ionic superposition states by using the data obtained via\nmolecular dynamics simulations. Our main approach is according to what Tegmark\nhas used before. In fact, Tegmark didn't consider the ion channel structure and\nhis estimates are only simple approximations. In this paper, we focus on the\nsmall nano-scale part of KcsA ion channels which is called \"selectivity filter\"\nand has a key role in the operation of an ion channel. Our results for\nsuperposition states of potassium ions indicate that decoherence times are in\nthe order of picoseconds which are 10-100 million times bigger than the order\ncalculated by Tegmark. This decoherence time is still not enough for cognitive\nprocessing in the brain, however it can be adequate for quantum states of\ncooled ions in the filter to leave their quantum traces on the filter and\naction potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 21:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

Since maintaining a\nlink can be costly, we assume that each bacterium forms and maintains a link\nonly if the benefit received from the link is larger than the cost, and we\nformalize the interaction among bacteria as a dynamic network formation game.\nWe rigorously characterize some of the key properties of the network evolution\ndepending on the parameters of the system. In particular, we derive the\nparameters under which it is guaranteed that all bacteria will join\nmicro-colonies and the parameters under which it is guaranteed that some\nbacteria will not join micro-colonies. Importantly, our study does not only\ncharacterize the properties of networks emerging in equilibrium, but it also\nprovides important insights on how the network dynamically evolves and on how\nthe formation history impacts the emerging networks in equilibrium. This\nanalysis can be used to develop methods to influence on- the-fly the evolution\nof the network, and such methods can be useful to treat or prevent\nbiofilm-related diseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 19:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-30"}

Data to analyze are read counts, commonly modeled\nusing Negative Binomial distributions. A relevant issue associated with this\nprobabilistic framework is the reliable estimation of the overdispersion\nparameter, reinforced by the limited number of replicates generally observable\nfor each gene. Many strategies have been proposed to estimate this parameter,\nbut when differential analysis is the purpose, they often result in procedures\nbased on plug-in estimates, and we show here that this discrepancy between the\nestimation framework and the testing framework can lead to uncontrolled type-I\nerrors. Instead we propose a mixture model that allows each gene to share\ninformation with other genes that exhibit similar variability. Three consistent\nstatistical tests are developed for differential expression analysis. We show\nthat the proposed method improves the sensitivity of detecting differentially\nexpressed genes with respect to the common procedures, since it is the best one\nin reaching the nominal value for the first-type error, while keeping elevate\npower. The method is finally illustrated on prostate cancer RNA-seq data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 17:52:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 08:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-10"}
