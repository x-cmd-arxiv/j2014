PS1 comet detection procedures currently\nconsist of the comparison of the point spread functions (PSFs) of moving\nobjects to those of reference stars, and the flagging of objects that show\nanomalously large radial PSF widths. Based on the number of missed discovery\nopportunities among comets discovered by other observers, we estimate an upper\nlimit comet discovery efficiency rate of ~70% for PS1. Additional analyses that\ncould improve comet discovery yields in future surveys include linear PSF\nanalysis, modeling of trailed stellar PSFs for comparison to trailed moving\nobject PSFs, searches for azimuthally localized activity, comparison of\npoint-source-optimized photometry to extended-source-optimized photometry,\nsearches for photometric excesses in objects with known absolute magnitudes,\nand crowd-sourcing.

Here tipping refers to the dramatic change in dynamical behavior\ncharacterized by a rapid transition away from a previously attracting state. In\nthe absence of the periodic forcing, it is well-known that a slowly varying\nbifurcation parameter produces a delay in this transition, beyond the\nbifurcation point for the static case. Using a multiple scales analysis, we\nconsider the effect of amplitude and frequency of the periodic forcing relative\nto the drifting rate of the slowly varying bifurcation parameter.\n  We show that a high frequency oscillation drives an earlier tipping when the\nbifurcation parameter varies more slowly, with the advance of the tipping point\nproportional to the square of the ratio of amplitude to frequency. In the low\nfrequency case the position of the tipping point is affected by the frequency,\namplitude and phase of the oscillation.

In computational biology, it can be used to\ntransfer biological knowledge from a well-studied species to a poorly-studied\nspecies between aligned network regions. Typically, existing network aligners\nfirst compute similarities between nodes in different networks (via a node cost\nfunction) and then aim to find a high-scoring alignment (node mapping between\nthe networks) with respect to \"node conservation\", typically the total node\ncost function over all aligned nodes. Only after an alignment is constructed,\nthe existing methods evaluate its quality with respect to an alternative\nmeasure, such as \"edge conservation\". Thus, we recently aimed to directly\noptimize edge conservation while constructing an alignment, which improved\nalignment quality. Here, we approach a novel idea of maximizing both node and\nedge conservation, and we also approach this idea from a novel perspective, by\naligning optimally edges between networks first in order to improve node cost\nfunction needed to then align well nodes between the networks. In the process,\nunlike the existing measures of edge conservation that treat each conserved\nedge the same, we favor conserved edges that are topologically similar over\nconserved edges that are topologically dissimilar.

Here we show that the recombination energy in the\nsuperadiabatic layer plays an important and hitherto unaccounted-for role in he\ndonor's response to mass loss, in particular on its luminosity and effective\ntemperature. Our improved optically thick nozzle method to calculate the mass\ntransfer rate via $L_1$ allows us to evolve binary systems for a substantial\nRoche lobe overflow. We propose a new, strengthened criterion for the mass\ntransfer instability, basing it on whether the donor experiences overflow\nthrough its outer Lagrangian point. We find that with the new criterion, if the\ndonor has a well-developed outer convective envelope, the critical initial mass\nratio for which a binary would evolve stably through the conservative mass\ntransfer varies from $1.5$ to $2.2$, which is about twice as large as\npreviously believed. In underdeveloped giants with shallow convective envelopes\nthis critical ratio may be even larger.

In fact, the\nvisual system needs to extract rapidly the most important elements of the\nexternal world from a large flux of information, for survival purposes. A rapid\nand reliable detection of visual stimuli is essential for triggering autonomic\nresponses to emotive stimuli, for initiating adaptive behaviors and for\norienting towards potentially interesting/ dangerous stimuli. The speed of\nvisual processing can be as fast as 20 ms, about only 20 times the duration of\nthe elementary information exchanges by the action potential. The limitations\nto the brain capacity to process visual information, imposed by intrinsic\nenergetic costs of neuronal activity, and ecological limits to the size of the\nskull, require a strong data reduction at an early stage, by creating a compact\nsummary of relevant information, the so called \"primal sketch\", to be handled\nby further levels of processing. This is quite similar to the problem of\nexperimental HEP of providing fast data reduction at a reasonable monetary\ncost, and with a practical device size. As a result of a joint effort of HEP\nphysicists and practicing vision scientists, we recently proposed that not only\nthe problems are similar, but the solutions adopted in the two cases also have\nstrong similarities, and their parallel study can actually shed light on each\nother. Modeling the visual system as a trigger processor leads to a deeper\nunderstanding, and even very specific predictions of its functionality.\nConversely, the insights gained from this new approach to vision, can lead to\nnew ideas for enhancing the capabilities of artificial vision systems, and HEP\ntrigger systems as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 2014 23:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}

Inspired by the classic\npreferences models in social choice theory, we start from an abstract social\nnetwork framework, called preference networks; these consist of a finite set of\nmembers where each member has a total-ranking preference of all members in the\nset.\n  Within this framework, we develop two complementary approaches to\naxiomatically study the formation and structures of communities. (1) We apply\nsocial choice theory and define communities indirectly by postulating that they\nare fixed points of a preference aggregation function obeying certain desirable\naxioms. (2) We directly postulate desirable axioms for communities without\nreference to preference aggregation, leading to eight natural community axioms.\n  These approaches allow us to formulate and analyze community rules. We prove\na taxonomy theorem that provides a structural characterization of the family of\ncommunity rules that satisfies all eight axioms. The structure is actually\nquite beautiful: these community rules form a bounded lattice under the natural\nintersection and union operations. Our structural theorem is complemented with\na complexity result: while identifying a community by the most selective rule\nof the lattice is in P, deciding if a subset is a community by the most\ncomprehensive rule of the lattice is coNP-complete. Our studies also shed light\non the limitations of defining community rules solely based on preference\naggregation: any aggregation function satisfying Arrow's IIA axiom, or based on\ncommonly used aggregation schemes like the Borda count or generalizations\nthereof, lead to communities which violate at least one of our community\naxioms.

Here we\ninvestigate stability and electronic properties of honeycomb structure of\narsenic system based on first principle calculations. Two types of honeycomb\nstructures, buckled and puckered, are found to be stable. We call them arsenene\nas in the case of phosphorene. We find that both the buckled and puckered\narsenene possess indirect gaps. We show that the band gap of the puckered and\nbuckled arsenene can be tuned by applying strain. The gap closing occurs at 6%\nstrain for puckered arsenene, where the bond angles between the nearest\nneighbour become nearly equal. An indirect-to-direct gap transition occurs by\napplying strain. Especially, 1% strain is enough to transform the puckered\narsenene into a direct-gap semiconductor. Our results will pave a way for\napplications to light-emitting diodes and solar cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 06:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-26"}

In other words, there always exist minima. For example,\nwhen a system is heated by two reservoirs from $T=300\\,K$ initially to\n$T=400\\,K$ at the final steady state, $B$ decreases steadily first.

Because this can lead to a considerable number of\ndifferent multipoles it is of great importance to use microscopic techniques\nthat are sensitive to their subtle physical differences. Here we investigate\nwhether quasiparticle interference (QPI) method can distinguish between the two\nmost frequently proposed HO parameter models: the even rank-4 hexadecapole and\nthe odd-rank-5 dotriacontapole model.

Tits in order to study semi-simple\nalgebraic groups from a geometrical point of view. One of the most important\nresults in the theory of buildings is the classification of irreducible\nspherical buildings of rank at least 3. About 25 years ago, M. Ronan and J.\nTits defined the class of twin buildings, which generalize spherical buildings\nin a natural way. The motivation of their definition is provided by the theory\nof Kac-Moody groups.\n  A 2-spherical twin building is uniquely determined by its local structure in\nalmost all cases: The so-called foundation is the union of the rank 2 residues\nwhich contain an (arbitrary) chamber. Therefore, the classification of\n2-spherical twin buildings reduces to the classification of all foundations\nwhich can be realized as the local structure of such a twin building. We call\nsuch a foundation \"integrable\".\n  By a result of Tits, an integrable foundation is Moufang, which means that\nthe rank 2 buildings in the foundation are Moufang polygons, and that the\nglueings are compatible with the Moufang structures induced on the rank 1\nresidues. As a consequence, the classification of Moufang polygons and the\nsolution of the isomorphism problem for Moufang sets are essential to work out\nwhich Moufang polygons fit together in order to form a foundation.\n  The present thesis contributes to establish complete lists of integrable\nfoundations for certain types of diagrams, namely for simply laced diagrams and\nfor 443 triangle diagrams. In this process, we closely follow the approach for\nthe classification of spherical buildings. However, we have to refine the\ntechniques used there, since in general, foundations don't only depend on the\ndiagram and the defining field.\n  Moreover, one of the main results in the context of Moufang sets is the\nsolution of the isomorphism problem for Moufang sets of pseudo-quadratic\nspaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 09:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}

Although many works have focused on the\nmachine learning aspect once a global representation has been produced, little\nwork has been devoted to the construction of those base image representations:\nmost works use standard coding and aggregation techniques directly on top of\nstandard computer vision features such as SIFT or HOG.\n  We propose to learn local mid-level features suitable for building word image\nrepresentations. These features are learnt by leveraging character bounding box\nannotations on a small set of training images. However, contrary to other\napproaches that use character bounding box information, our approach does not\nrely on detecting the individual characters explicitly at testing time.

This particular spin-down\nstate switching is broadly consistent with free precession of the pulsar,\nhowever, a strong evidence linked with this mechanism is not clearly\nestablished. We also confirm that the pulsar occasionally emits groups of\npulses which appear early in pulse phase, so-called \"flares\", and these events\nsignificantly contribute to the pulse profile shape.

For this\npurpose we collected a sample of 18 dense (Sigma>2500 M_sun/pc^2) ETGs at\n1.2<z<1.6 with available velocity dispersion sigma_e. We have constrained their\nmass-normalization by comparing their true stellar masses (M_true) derived\nthrough virial theorem, hence IMF independent, with those inferred through the\nfit of the photometry assuming a reference IMF (M_ref). Adopting the virial\nestimator as proxy of the true stellar mass, we have assumed for these ETGs\nzero dark matter (DM). However, dynamical models and numerical simulations of\ngalaxy evolution have shown that the DM fraction within Re in dense high-z ETGs\nis negligible. We have considered the possible bias of virial theorem in\nrecovering the total masses and have shown that for dense ETGs the virial\nmasses are in agreement with those derived through more sophisticated dynamical\nmodels. The variation of the parameter Gamma = M_true/M_ref with sigma_e shows\nthat, on average, dense ETGs at <z> = 1.4 follow the same IMF-sigma_e trend of\ntypical local ETGs, but with a lower mass-normalization. Nonetheless, once the\nIMF-sigma_e trend we have found for high-z dense ETGs is compared with that of\nlocal ETGs with similar Sigma and sigma_e, they turn out to be consistent. The\nsimilarity between the IMF-sigma_e trends of dense high-z and low-z ETGs over 9\nGyr of evolution and their lower mass-normalization with respect to the mean\nvalue of local ETGs suggest that, independently on formation redshift, the\nphysical conditions characterizing the formation of a dense spheroid lead to a\nmass spectrum of new formed stars with an higher ratio of high- to low-mass\nstars with respect to the IMF of normal local ETGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 11:24:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 11:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

To alleviate the effects of scattered data access we combine\nloosely coupled outer iterations with tightly coupled block sparse matrix\nmultiple vector operations, which enables pure data streaming. All\noptimizations are guided by a performance analysis and modelling process that\nindicates how the computational bottlenecks change with each optimization step.\nFinally we use the optimized node-level KPM with a hybrid-parallel framework to\nperform large scale heterogeneous electronic structure calculations for novel\ntopological materials on a petascale-class Cray XC30 system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 12:16:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2015 10:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-30"}

We use the PICARD code to perform\nhigh-resolution 3D simulations of electrons and protons in galactic propagation\nscenarios that include four-arm and two-arm logarithmic spiral cosmic ray\nsource distributions with and without a central bar structure as well as the\nspiral arm configuration of the NE2001 model for the distribution of free\nelectrons in the Milky Way. Results of these simulation are compared to an\naxisymmetric radial source distribution. Also, effects on the cosmic ray flux\nand spectra due to different positions of the Earth relative to the spiral\nstructure are studied. We find that high energy electrons are strongly confined\nto their sources and the obtained spectra largely depend on the Earth's\nposition relative to the spiral arms. Similar finding have been obtained for\nlow energy protons and electrons albeit at smaller magnitude. We find that even\nfractional contributions of a spiral arm component to the total cosmic ray\nsource distribution influences the spectra on the Earth. This is apparent when\ncompared to an axisymmetric radial source distribution as well as with respect\nto the Earth's position relative to the spiral arm structure.

Using a spiral arm geometry as a cosmic ray\nsource distributions offers a genuine new quality of modelling and is used to\nexplain features in cosmic ray spectra at the Earth that are else-wise\nattributed to other propagation effects.

To study the impact of the momentum\nfrom the wind of a massive star on the surrounding neutral or ionized material,\nwe implemented a new HEALPix-based momentum conserving wind scheme in the\nSmoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code SEREN. A qualitative study of the\nimpact of the feedback from an O7.5-like star on a self gravitating sphere\nshows that, on its own, the transfer of momentum from a wind onto cold\nsurrounding gas has both a compressing and dispersing effect. It mostly affects\ngas at low and intermediate densities. When combined with a stellar source's\nionizing UV radiation, we find the momentum driven wind to have little direct\neffect on the gas. We conclude that, during a massive star's main sequence, the\nUV ionizing radiation is the main feedback mechanism shaping and compressing\nthe cold gas. Overall, the wind's effects on the dense gas dynamics and on the\ntriggering of star formation are very modest. The structures formed in the\nionization-only simulation and in the combined feedback simulation are\nremarkably similar. However, in the combined feedback case, different SPH\nparticles end up being compressed. This indicates that the microphysics of gas\nmixing differ between the two feedback simulations and that the winds can\ncontribute to the localized redistribution and reshuffling of gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 14:00:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 13:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We consider\nthe effects of anisotropic radiation from accretion disks on the broad-line\nregion (BLR), from the Shakura-Sunyaev regime to slim disks with\nsuper-Eddington accretion rates. The geometrically thick funnel of the inner\nregion of slim disks produces strong self-shadowing effects that lead to very\nstrong anisotropy of the radiation field. We demonstrate that the degree of\nanisotropy of the radiation fields grows with increasing accretion rate. As a\nresult of this anisotropy, BLR clouds receive different spectral energy\ndistributions depending on their location relative to the disk, resulting in\ndiverse observational appearance of the BLR. We show that the self-shadowing of\nthe inner parts of the disk naturally produces two dynamically distinct regions\nof the BLR, depending on accretion rate. These two regions manifest themselves\nas kinematically distinct components of the broad H$\\beta$ line profile with\ndifferent line widths and fluxes, which jointly account for the Lorentzian\nprofile generally observed in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. In the time\ndomain, these two components are expected reverberate with different time lags\nwith respect to the varying ionizing continuum, depending on the accretion rate\nand the viewing angle of the observer. The diverse appearance of the BLR due to\nthe anisotropic ionizing energy source can be tested by reverberation mapping\nof H$\\beta$ and other broad emission lines (e.g., \\feii), providing a new tool\nto diagnose the structure and dynamics of the BLR.

We calculate the response of the effective\nconserved spin current to the applied electric field, which is composed of\nconventional and spin torque currents, by using the Kubo formula. We find that\nthe conventional spin current is not determined by the Berry phase effect.\nRemarkably, the spin torque Hall current is found to be proportional to the\nBerry phase, and the longitudinal spin torque current vanishes because of the\nBerry phase effect. When the $k$-linear spin-orbit interaction dominates the\nsystem, the Berry phase on the Fermi surface maintains two invariant\nproperties. One is that the magnitude of the spin torque current protected by\nthe Berry phase is unchanged by a small fluctuation of energy dispersion. The\nother one is that the change in the direction of the applied electric field\ndoes not change the magnitude of the spin torque current even if the energy\ndispersion is not spherically symmetric; i.e., the Berry phase effect has no\ndependence on the two-dimensional material orientation.

Although widely used in tackling deterministic coupled models,\nseveral challenges arise in extending the benefits of modularization to\nuncertainty propagation. On one hand, Monte-Carlo (MC) based methods are\nprohibitively expensive as the cost of each deterministic PDE solve is usually\nquite large, while on the other hand, even if each module contains a moderate\nnumber of uncertain parameters, implementing spectral methods on the combined\nhigh-dimensional parameter space can be prohibitively expensive. In this work,\nwe present a reduced non-intrusive spectral projection (NISP) based uncertainty\npropagation method which separates and modularizes the uncertainty propagation\ntask in each subproblem using block Gauss-Seidel (BGS) techniques. The overall\ncomputational costs in the proposed method are also mitigated by constructing\nreduced approximations of the input data entering each module. These reduced\napproximations and the corresponding quadrature rules are constructed via\nsimple linear algebra transformations. We describe these components of the\nproposed algorithm assuming a generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) model of the\nstochastic solutions. We demonstrate our proposed method and its computational\ngains over the standard NISP method using numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 15:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

A logical framework is introduced to properly deal with\npropositions about objects in a multiplicity of worlds. In this logical\nframework, the continuum of worlds is treated in analogy to the continuum of\ntime points, both \"time\" and \"world\" are considered as mutually independent\nmodes of existence. The theory combines elements of Bohmian mechanics and of\nEverett's many-worlds interpretation, it has a clear ontology and a set of\nprecisely defined postulates from where the predictions of standard quantum\nmechanics can be derived. Probability as given by the Born rule emerges as a\nconsequence of insufficient knowledge of observers about which world it is that\nthey live in. The theory describes a continuum of worlds rather than a single\nworld or a discrete set of worlds, so it is similar in spirit to many-worlds\ninterpretations based on Everett's approach, without being actually reducible\nto these. In particular, there is no splitting of worlds, which is a typical\nfeature of Everett-type theories. Altogether, the theory explains (1) the\nsubjective occurrence of probabilities, (2) their quantitative value as given\nby the Born rule, and (3) the apparently random \"collapse of the wavefunction\"\ncaused by the measurement, while still being an objectively deterministic\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 2014 22:16:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2014 10:22:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 21:35:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 00:05:56 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2015 06:15:15 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2015 21:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-18"}
