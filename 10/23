However, it\nis still important to improve these methods to be able to extract all the\npossible information contained in the data. In this paper, we propose a new\napproach to handle the problem, the so-called inpainting method. This\ntechnique, based on a sparsity prior, enables to judiciously fill-in the gaps\nin the data, preserving the asteroseismic signal, as far as possible. The\nimpact of the observational window function is reduced and the interpretation\nof the power spectrum is simplified. This method is applied both on ground and\nspace-based data. It appears that the inpainting technique improves the\noscillation modes detection and estimation. Additionally, it can be used to\nstudy very long time series of many stars because its computation is very fast.\nFor a time series of 50 days of CoRoT-like data, it allows a speed-up factor of\n1000, if compared to methods of the same accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 16:01:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

For very big matrices a low rank approximation using SVD\nis not computationally feasible. In this case different approximations are\navailable. It seems that variants of CUR decomposition are most suitable. For\nd-mode tensors T with d>2, many generalizations of the singular value\ndecomposition have been proposed to obtain low tensor rank decompositions. The\nmost appropriate approximation seems to be best (r_1,...,r_d)-approximation,\nwhich maximizes the l_2 norm of the projection of T on a tensor product of\nsubspaces U_1,...,U_d, where U_i is an r_i-dimensional subspace. One of the\nmost common method is the alternating maximization method (AMM). It is obtained\nby maximizing on one subspace U_i, while keeping all other fixed, and\nalternating the procedure repeatedly for i=1,...,d. Usually, AMM will converge\nto a local best approximation.

This question can be related to a graph\nlabeling problem known as the cyclic bandwidth sum problem. It consists in\nfinding a labeling of the vertices of an undirected and unweighted graph with\ndistinct integers such that the sum of (cyclic) difference of labels of\nadjacent vertices is minimized. Although theoretical results exist that give\noptimal value of cyclic bandwidth sum for standard graphs, there are neither\nresults in the general case, nor explicit methods to reach this optimal result.\nIn addition to this lack of theoretical knowledge, only a few methods have been\nproposed to approximately solve this problem. In this paper, we introduce a new\nheuristic to find an approximate solution for the cyclic bandwidth sum problem,\nby following the structure of the graph. The heuristic is a two-step algorithm:\nthe first step consists of traversing the graph to find a set of paths which\nfollow the structure of the graph, using a similarity criterion based on the\nJaccard index to jump from one vertex to the next one. The second step is the\nmerging of all obtained paths, based on a greedy approach that extends a\npartial solution by inserting a new path at the position that minimizes the\ncyclic bandwidth sum. The effectiveness of the proposed heuristic, both in\nterms of performance and time execution, is shown through experiments on graphs\nwhose optimal value of CBS is known as well as on real-world networks, where\nthe consistence between labeling and topology is highlighted. An extension to\nweighted graphs is also proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 17:07:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 10:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-17"}

Robust decompositions have\nshown to be good at splitting a corrupted matrix into an uncorrupted low-rank\nmatrix and a sparse matrix, containing outliers. However, this process only\nworks when matrices have relatively low rank with respect to their ambient\nspace, a property not met in motion estimation problems. As a solution, we\npropose to exploit the partial information present in the decomposition to\ndecide which matches are outliers. We provide evidences showing that even when\nit is not possible to recover an uncorrupted low-rank matrix, the resulting\ninformation can be exploited for outlier detection. To this end we propose the\nRobust Decomposition with Constrained Rank (RD-CR), a proximal gradient based\nmethod that enforces the rank constraints inherent to motion estimation. We\nalso present a general framework to perform robust estimation for stereo Visual\nOdometry, based on our RD-CR and a simple but effective compressed optimization\nmethod that achieves high performance.

Regarding the emergency of this\nsituation, there is a need of development of decision tools, such as\nmathematical models, to assist the authorities to focus their efforts in\nimportant factors to eradicate Ebola. In this work, we propose a novel\ndeterministic spatial-temporal model, called Be-CoDiS (Between-Countries\nDisease Spread), to study the evolution of human diseases within and between\ncountries. The main interesting characteristics of Be-CoDiS are the\nconsideration of the movement of people between countries, the control measure\neffects and the use of time dependent coefficients adapted to each country.\nFirst, we focus on the mathematical formulation of each component of the model\nand explain how its parameters and inputs are obtained.

It matches the near-infrared H$_2$ and the Na D optical absorption\nlines. If the wing is interpreted as an outflow, the mass loss rate would be\nlarger than 20M$_{\\odot}$/yr, and the depletion timescale shorter than the\norbital timescale ($10^8$yr).

However, due to the\nmulti-phase origins of [CII], one might expect this relation to break down at\nsmall scales. We investigate the origins of [CII] emission by examining high\nspatial resolution observations of [CII] in M31, with the Survey of Lines in\nM31 (SLIM).

We find that the [CII] - SFR correlation holds even at these\nscales, although the relation typically has a flatter slope than found at\nlarger (~kpc) scales. While the Halpha emission in M31 is concentrated in the\nSFR regions, we find that a significant amount (~20-90%) of the [CII] emission\ncomes from outside star-forming regions, and that the total IR (TIR) emission\nhas the highest diffuse fraction of all SFR tracers. We find a weak correlation\nof the [CII]/TIR to dust color in each Field, and find a large scale trend of\nincreasing [CII]/TIR with galactocentric radius. The differences in the\nrelative diffuse fractions of [CII], Halpha and IR tracers are likely caused by\na combination of energetic photon leakage from HII regions and heating by the\ndiffuse radiation field arising from older (B-star) stellar populations.\nHowever, we find that by averaging our measurements over ~kpc scales, these\neffects are minimized, and the relation between [CII] and SFR found in other\nnearby galaxy studies is retrieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 20:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Nonrelativistic\ninteraction energy of the system is determined using the frozen-core full\nconfiguration interaction calculations combined with high-level coupled cluster\ncorrection for inner-shell effects. Newly developed STOs basis sets, ranging in\nquality from double to sextuple zeta, are used in these computations.\nPrinciples of their construction are discussed and several atomic benchmarks\nare presented. Relativistic effects of order ${\\alpha}^2$ are calculated\nperturbatively by using the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian and are found to be\nsignificant. We also estimate the leading-order QED effects. Influence of the\nadiabatic correction is found to be negligible. Finally, the interaction energy\nof the beryllium dimer is determined to be 929.0$\\,\\pm\\,$1.9 $cm^{-1}$, in a\nvery good agreement with the recent experimental value. The results presented\nhere appear to be the most accurate ab-initio calculations for the beryllium\ndimer available in the literature up to date and probably also one of the most\naccurate calculations for molecular systems containing more than four\nelectrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 20:20:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 16:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-21"}

However, the process of progressive pathogen adaptation to\nquantitative resistance is poorly understood, which makes it difficult to\npredict its durability or to derive principles for its sustainable deployment.\nHere, we study the dynamics of pathogen adaptation in response to quantitative\nplant resistance affecting pathogen reproduction rate and its carrying\ncapacity. We developed a stochastic model for the continuous evolution of a\npathogen population within a quantitatively resistant host. We assumed that\npathogen can adapt to a host by the progressive restoration of reproduction\nrate or of carrying capacity, or of both. Our model suggests that a combination\nof QTLs affecting distinct pathogen traits was more durable if the evolution of\nrepressed traits was antagonistic. Otherwise, quantitative resistance that\ndepressed only pathogen reproduction was more durable. In order to decelerate\nthe progressive pathogen adaptation, QTLs that decrease the pathogen's ability\nto extend must be combined with QTLs that decrease the spore production per\nlesion or the infection efficiency or that increase the latent period. Our\ntheoretical framework can help breeders to develop principles for sustainable\ndeployment of quantitative trait loci..\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 20:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-24"}

The rate at\nwhich MRI-driven turbulence transports angular momentum is related to both the\nstrength of the amplitudes of the fluctuations on various scales and the degree\nof anisotropy of the underlying turbulence. This has motivated several studies\nof the distribution of turbulent power in spectral space. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the anisotropic nature of MRI-driven turbulence using a\npseudo-spectral code and introduce novel ways to robustly characterize the\nunderlying turbulence. We show that the general flow properties vary in a\nquasi-periodic way on timescales comparable to 10 inverse angular frequencies\nmotivating the temporal analysis of its anisotropy. We introduce a 3D tensor\ninvariant analysis to quantify and classify the evolution of the anisotropic\nturbulent flow. This analysis shows a continuous high level of anisotropy, with\nbrief sporadic transitions towards two- and three-component isotropic turbulent\nflow. This temporal-dependent anisotropy renders standard shell-average,\nespecially when used simultaneously with long temporal averages, inadequate for\ncharacterizing MRI-driven turbulence. We propose an alternative way to extract\nspectral information from the turbulent magnetized flow, whose anisotropic\ncharacter depends strongly on time. This consists of stacking 1D Fourier\nspectra along three orthogonal directions that exhibit maximum anisotropy in\nFourier space. The resulting averaged spectra show that the power along each of\nthe three independent directions differs by several orders of magnitude over\nmost scales, except the largest ones. Our results suggest that a\nfirst-principles theory to describe fully developed MRI-driven turbulence will\nlikely have to consider the anisotropic nature of the flow at a fundamental\nlevel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 21:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-26"}

The sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, among\nother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller the\nseparation, the better the sensitivity. Hence, a co-located detector pair is\nmore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-located\ndetector pair. However, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer from\ncorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that could\ncontaminate the measurement of the background. Hence, methods to identify and\nmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potential\nincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. Here we report on the first\nSGWB analysis using the two LIGO Hanford detectors and address the\ncomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. We apply correlated\nnoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two LIGO\nHanford detectors, H1 and H2, during LIGO's fifth science run. At low\nfrequencies, 40 - 460 Hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlated\nnoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochastic\ngravitational-wave signal. However, at high frequencies, 460-1000 Hz, these\ntechniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (C.L.) upper limit on\nthe gravitational-wave energy density of \\Omega(f)<7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 Hz)^3,\nwhich improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\\sim 180$. In doing\nso, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches using\nadvanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)\nmay affect even widely separated detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Oct 2014 23:34:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 06:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 00:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

Inflows\nare observed in ionized gas in LINERs, and in warm molecular gas in more\nluminous AGN, being usually found on hundred of pc scales. Mass outflow rates\nin ionized gas are of the order of a few solar masses per year, while the mass\ninflow rates are of the order of tenths of solar masses per year. Mass inflow\nrates in warm molecular gas are ~4-5 orders of magnitude lower, but these\ninflows seem to be only tracers of more massive inflows in cold molecular gas\nthat should be observable at mm wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 04:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

These chiral properties are related\nto the anti-symmetric exchange, also referred to as the interfacial\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)9,10. For numerous phenomena, the\nrelative strengths of the symmetric Heisenberg exchange and the DMI is of great\nimportance. Here, we use optical spin-wave spectroscopy (Brillouin light\nscattering) to directly determine the DMI vector for a series of Ni80Fe20/Pt\nsamples, and then compare the nearest-neighbor DMI coupling energy with the\nindependently measured Heisenberg exchange integral.

For example, as a camera pans upwards from a building\nentrance over its first few floors and then further up into the sky Fig. 1,\nsome feature counts in the image drop while others rise -- only to drop again\ngiving way to features found more often at higher elevations. The space of all\npossible feature count combinations is constrained both by the properties of\nthe larger scene and the size and the location of the window into it. To\ncapture such variation, in this paper we propose the use of the counting grid\nmodel. This generative model is based on a grid of feature counts, considerably\nlarger than any of the modeled images, and considerably smaller than the real\nestate needed to tile the images next to each other tightly. Each modeled image\nis assumed to have a representative window in the grid in which the feature\ncounts mimic the feature distribution in the image. We provide a learning\nprocedure that jointly maps all images in the training set to the counting grid\nand estimates the appropriate local counts in it. Experimentally, we\ndemonstrate that the resulting representation captures the space of feature\ncount combinations more accurately than the traditional models, not only when\nthe input images come from a panning camera, but even when modeling images of\ndifferent scenes from the same category.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 07:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-28"}

The non-trivial automorphisms of those\ngraphs make visible the dynamical symmetries that an ABM gives rise to because\nsets of micro configurations can be interchanged without changing the\nprobability structure of the random walk.

Comet 96P/Machholz 1 is currently locked in a Kozai resonance with\nJupiter such that the value of its argument of perihelion is always close to 0\ndegrees at its shortest possible perihelion (highest eccentricity and lowest\ninclination) and about 180 degrees near its shortest aphelion (longest\nperihelion distance, lowest eccentricity and highest inclination). If this\nobject is a dynamical analogue (albeit limited) of the known ETNOs, this\nimplies that massive perturbers must keep them confined in orbital parameter\nspace. Besides, its future dynamical evolution displays orbital flips when its\neccentricity is excited to a high value and its orbit turns over by nearly 180\ndegrees, rolling over its major axis.

After that, a\nclassifier, such as support vector machine, is required to classify those\nfeatures. In this manner, classification task is achieved in two isolated\nsteps. We proposed supervised Canonical Polyadic Decomposition by directly\nincorporating auxiliary label information during decomposition, by which a\nclassification task can be achieved without an extra step of classifier\ntraining. The proposed method merges the decomposition and classifier learning\ntogether, so it reduces procedure of classification task compared with that of\nrespective decomposition and classification. In order to evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed method, three different kinds of signals, synthetic\nsignal, EEG signal, and MEG signal, were used. The results based on evaluations\nof synthetic and real signals demonstrated that the proposed method is\neffective and efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 10:14:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2015 14:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-31"}

To quantify the benefits of using\nproper noise models, RUMBA-SD was compared with dRL-SD, a well-established\nmethod based on the RL algorithm for Gaussian noise. Another aim of the study\nwas to quantify the impact of including a total variation (TV) spatial\nregularization term in the estimation framework.

The stream has two\ncomponents: a bridge-like feature extended between NGC 4631 and NGC 4656\n(stream_SE) and an overdensity with extended features on the opposite side of\nthe NGC 4631 disk (stream_NW). Together, these features extend more than 85 kpc\nand display a clear (g-r) colour gradient. The orientation of stream_SE\nrelative to the orientations of NGC 4631 and NGC 4656 is not consistent with an\norigin from interaction between these two spirals, and is more likely debris\nfrom a satellite encounter. The stellar tidal features can be qualitatively\nreproduced in an N-body model of the tidal disruption of a single, massive\ndwarf satellite on a moderately eccentric orbit (e=0.6) around NGC 4631 over\n$\\sim$ 3.5 Gyr, with a dynamical mass ratio (m1:m2) of ~40.

The detailed structure\nof stream_NW suggests it may contain the progenitor of the stream, in agreement\nwith the N-body model. In addition, stream_NW is roughly aligned with two very\nfaint dwarf spheroidal candidates. The system of dwarf galaxies and the tidal\nstream around NGC 4631 can provide an additional interesting case for exploring\nthe anisotropy distribution of satellite galaxies recently reported in Local\nGroup spiral galaxies by means of future follow-up observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 13:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-21"}

On\nthe other hand, for small alkali metals, studies on (Li,Na)FeCu(S,Se)2 and\nNaFe2-{\\delta}S2 shows that these compounds possess CaAl2Si2-type structure,\nimplying that ThCr2Si2-type structure is unstable for small alkali-metal\nintercalated FeSe under high-temperature. Here we report a new intercalate\nNa0.65(1)Fe1.93(1)Se2 with Tc ~ 37 K, synthesized by low-temperature\nammonothermal method. The notable finding is that the Na0.65(1)Fe1.93(1)Se2\nshows a ThCr2Si2-type structure, which is the first instance of small-sized\nalkali metal intercalates without NH3 co-intercalation. Besides, the NH3-poor\nNa0.80(4)(NH3)0.60Fe1.86(1)Se2 and NH3-rich phase with Tcs at 45 K and 42 K are\nidentified by tuning the concentration of Na-NH3 solutions.

Focusing on\nquadratic functions we are able to examine optimization algorithms as a\nrecursive application of linear operators. This, in turn, reveals a powerful\nconnection between a class of optimization algorithms and the analytic theory\nof polynomials whereby new lower and upper bounds are derived. In particular,\nwe present a new and natural derivation of Nesterov's well-known Accelerated\nGradient Descent method by employing simple 'economic' polynomials. This rather\nnatural interpretation of AGD contrasts with earlier ones which lacked a\nsimple, yet solid, motivation. Lastly, whereas existing lower bounds are only\nvalid when the dimensionality scales with the number of iterations, our lower\nbound holds in the natural regime where the dimensionality is fixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 15:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-24"}

Our goal is to\ncharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with the\nradio-to-X-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is less\noften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. We organized a\nmultiwavelength (MW) campaign on Mrk 501 between March and May 2008. This\nmulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive VHE gamma-ray instruments\nin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes\nMAGIC and VERITAS, as well as Swift, RXTE, the F-GAMMA, GASP-WEBT, and other\ncollaborations and instruments. Mrk 501 was found to be in a low state of\nactivity during the campaign, with a VHE flux in the range of 10%-20% of the\nCrab nebula flux. Nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected with\nvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. The\nbroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission states\nof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zone\nsynchrotron self-Compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described by\nan increase in the electron number density.

In order to\nmodel the scenario, the energy arising from the torsion component is considered\nanalogous to dark energy. An interaction between dark energy and dark matter is\nconsidered, which is by far the best possible tool to realize the coincidence.\nA set-up is designed and a constraint equation is obtained which screens the\nmodels of \\textit{f(T)} gravity that can successfully accommodate the\nstationary scenario in its framework, from those which cannot. Due to the\nabsence of a universally accepted interaction term introduced by a fundamental\ntheory, the study is conducted over three different forms of chosen interaction\nterms. As an illustration two widely known models of \\textit{f(T)} gravity are\ntaken into consideration and used in the designed setup. The study reveals that\nthe realization of the coincidence scenario as well as the role played by\ntorsion in the current universe is a model dependent phenomenon. It is found\nthat the first model showed a considerable departure from the stationary\nscenario. On the contrary the other four models are perfectly consistent with\nour setup and generated a satisfactory stationary scenario, thus showing their\ncosmological viability and their superiority over their counterparts. For the\nthird model (exponential model) it was seen that the cosmological coincidence\nis realized only in the phantom regime. For the fourth (logarithmic model) and\nthe fifth models, we see that the the stationary scenario is attained for\nnegative interaction values.

This is made\npossible by (i) using avalanche photodiodes (APD) as light detectors, (ii)\ndistributing the light received from the source over multiple independent\nspectral channels, and (iii) use of arrays composed of multiple large light\ncollectors. Our approach permits the construction of large (with baselines\nranging from few kilometers to intercontinental distances) optical\ninterferometers at the cost of (very) long-baseline radio interferometers.\nRealistic intensity interferometer designs are able to achieve limiting R-band\nmagnitudes as good as ~14, sufficient for spatially resolved observations of\nmain-sequence O-type stars in the Magellanic Clouds.

Understanding influenza dynamics and forecasting its impact is\nfundamental for developing prevention and mitigation strategies.\n  We combine modern data assimilation methods with Wikipedia access logs and\nCDC influenza like illness (ILI) reports to create a weekly forecast for\nseasonal influenza. The methods are applied to the 2013--2014 influenza season\nbut are sufficiently general to forecast any disease outbreak, given incidence\nor case count data.

The results show that prior to the peak of\nthe flu season, our forecasting method projected the actual outcome with a high\nprobability.
