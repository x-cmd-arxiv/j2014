This method is rank-deficient in the sense that the\nSPH approximation of the deformation gradient is not unique with respect to the\npositions of the integration points. The non-uniqueness can result in the\nformation of zero-energy modes. If undetected, these modes can grow and\ncompletely dominate the solution. Here, an algorithm is introduced, which\neffectively suppresses these modes in a fashion similar to hour-glass control\nmechanisms in Finite-Element methods. Simulations utilizing this control\nalgorithm result exhibit much improved stability, accuracy, and error\nconvergence properties. In contrast to an alternative method which eliminates\nzero-energy modes, namely the use of additional integration points, the here\npresented algorithm is easy to implement and computationally very efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 16:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

During the first\nstage, engulfment is relatively slow and progressively slows down as\nphagocytosis proceeds. However, at approximately half-engulfment, the rate of\nengulfment increases dramatically, with complete engulfment attained soon\nafterwards. By studying simple mathematical models of phagocytosis, we suggest\nthat the first stage is due to a passive mechanism, determined by receptor\ndiffusion and capture, whereas the second stage is more actively controlled,\nperhaps with receptors being driven towards the site of engulfment. We then\nconsider a more advanced model that includes signaling and captures both stages\nof engulfment. This model predicts that there is an optimum ligand density for\nquick engulfment.

Hyper combines\nmulti-Gaussian fitting with aperture photometry to provide reliable photometry\nin regions with variable backgrounds and in crowded fields. The background is\nevaluated and removed locally for each source using polynomial fits of various\norders. Source de-blending is done through simultaneous multi-Gaussian fitting\nof the main source and its companion(s), followed by the subtraction of the\ncompanion(s). Hyper allows also simultaneous multi-wavelength photometry by\nsetting a fixed aperture size independent of the map resolution and evaluating\nthe source flux within the same region of the sky at multiple wavelengths at\nthe same time. This new code has been initially designed for precise aperture\nphotometry in complex fields such as the Galactic plane observed in the far\ninfrared (FIR) by the Herschel infrared survey of the Galactic plane (Hi-GAL).\nHyper has been tested on both simulated and real Herschel fields to quantify\nthe quality of the source identification and photometry.

The frequencies of slowly rotating, barotropic, and non-magnetic\nNewtonian stars are well known, but subject to various corrections. After\nmaking simple estimates of the relative strengths of these corrections we\nconclude that relativistic corrections are likely to be the most important. For\nthis reason we extend the formalism of K. H. Lockitch, J. L. Friedman, and N.\nAndersson [Phys. Rev. D 68, 124010 (2003)], who consider relativistic\npolytropes, to the case of realistic equations of state. This formulation\nresults in perturbation equations which are solved using a spectral method. We\nfind that for realistic equations of state the r-mode frequency ranges from\n1.39 to 1.57 times the spin frequency of the star when the relativistic\ncompactness parameter (M/R) is varied over the astrophysically motivated\ninterval 0.11 to 0.31. The results presented here are relevant to the design of\ngravitational wave and electromagnetic r-mode searches, and following a\nsuccessful r-mode detection could help constrain the high density equation of\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 19:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

Variable selection is of critical importance in many\napplications, such as micro-array data analysis, where selecting a small number\nof discriminative features is crucial to developing useful models of disease\nmechanisms, as well as for prioritizing targets for drug discovery. The\nrecently proposed Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM) provides a way to learn a\nhyperplane classifier by minimizing an exact (\\boldmath{$\\Theta$}) bound on its\nVC dimension. It is well known that a lower VC dimension contributes to good\ngeneralization. For a linear hyperplane classifier in the input space, the VC\ndimension is upper bounded by the number of features; hence, a linear\nclassifier with a small VC dimension is parsimonious in the set of features it\nemploys. In this paper, we use the linear MCM to learn a classifier in which a\nlarge number of weights are zero; features with non-zero weights are the ones\nthat are chosen.

When molecular\nhydrogen is adsorbed onto an icy mantle through physisorption, a common\nassumption in gas-grain rate equation models is to use an adsorption energy for\nmolecular hydrogen on a pure water substrate. However, at high density and low\ntemperature, when H2 is efficiently adsorbed onto the mantle, its surface\nabundance can be strongly overestimated if this assumption is still used.\nUnfortunately, the more detailed microscopic Monte Carlo treatment cannot be\nused to study the abundance of H2 in ice mantles if a full gas-grain network is\nutilized. We present a numerical method adapted for rate-equation models that\ntakes into account the possibility that an H2 molecule can, while diffusing on\nthe surface, find itself bound to another hydrogen molecule, with a far weaker\nbond than the H2-water bond, which can lead to more efficient desorption. We\nlabel the ensuing desorption \"encounter desorption\". The method is implemented\nfirst in a simple system consisting only of hydrogen molecules at steady state\nbetween gas and dust using the rate-equation approach and comparing the results\nwith the results of a microscopic Monte Carlo calculation. We then discuss the\nuse of the rate-equation approach with encounter desorption embedded in a\ncomplete gas-grain chemical network. For both systems, the rate-equation model\nwith encounter desorption reproduces the H2 granular coverage computed by the\nmicroscopic Monte Carlo model. The method is especially useful for dense and\ncold environments, and for time-dependent physical conditions, such as occur in\nthe collapse of dense cores and the formation of protoplanetary disks. It is\nnot significantly CPU time consuming, so can be used for example with complex\n3D chemical-hydrodynamical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 19:53:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 15:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-21"}

SMBHs respond\nto this fueling by supplying energy back to the ambient gas. Numerical studies\nsuggest that this feedback is necessary to explain why the properties of SMBHs\nand the formation of bulges are closely related. This intimate link between the\nSMBH's mass and the large scale dynamics and luminosity of the host has proven\nto be a difficult issue to tackle with simulations due to the inability to\nresolve all the relevant length scales simultaneously. In this paper we\nsimulate SMBH growth at high-resolution with {\\it FLASH}, accounting for the\ngravitational focusing effects of nuclear star clusters (NSCs), which appear to\nbe ubiquitous in galactic nuclei. In the simulations, the NSC core is resolved\nby a minimum cell size of about 0.001 pc or approximately $10^{-3}$ of the\ncluster's radius. We discuss the conditions required for effective gas\nfunneling to occur, which are mainly dominated by a relationship between NSC\nvelocity dispersion and the local sound speed, and provide a sub-grid\nprescription for the augmentation of central SMBH accretion rates in the\npresence of NSCs. For the conditions expected to persist in the centers of\nmerging galaxies, the resultant large central gas densities in NSCs should\nproduce drastically enhanced embedded SMBH accretion rates - up to an order of\nmagnitude increase can be achieved for gas properties resembling those in\nlarge-scale galaxy merger simulations.

In this paper, we\nsystematically searched for and identified a large sample of post-starburst\ngalaxies from the spectroscopic dataset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nData Release 9.

We calculated the luminosity\nfunction of the post-starburst galaxies using two uniformly selected\nsubsamples: the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample and the Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey CMASS Sample. The luminosity functions are reasonably fit\nby half-Gaussian functions. The peak magnitudes shift as a function of redshift\nfrom $M\\sim-23.5$ at $z\\sim0.8$ to $M\\sim-20.3$ at $z\\sim0.1$. This is\nconsistent with the downsizing trend, whereby more massive galaxies form\nearlier than low-mass galaxies. We compared the mass of the post-starburst\nstellar population found in our sample to the decline of the global\nstar-formation rate and found that only a small amount ($\\sim1\\%$) of all\nstar-formation quenching in the redshift range $z=0.2-0.7$ results in\npost-starburst galaxies in the luminosity range our sample is sensitive to.\nTherefore, luminous post-starburst galaxies are not the place where most of the\ndecline in star-formation rate of the universe is happening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 20:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2016 17:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

We start from a M*-selected sample of\ngalaxies with reliable SFR and redshift estimates.

The infrared luminosities of our SFR-M*-z bins are estimated\nusing their stacked far-infrared flux densities inferred from observations\nobtained with Herschel. Their radio luminosities and radio spectral indices\n(i.e. alpha, where Snu nu^-alpha) are estimated using their stacked 1.4GHz and\n610MHz flux densities from the VLA and GMRT, respectively.

Such a calibration\nshould include well understood correlations with halo mass, and the possibility\nto identify galaxies which dominate their potential well (centrals), and their\nsatellites. Focusing on z = 1 and 2 we propose a method of environmental\ncalibration which can be applied to the next generation of low to medium\nresolution spectroscopic surveys. Using an up-to-date semi-analytic model of\ngalaxy formation, we measure the local density of galaxies in fixed apertures\non different scales. There is a clear correlation of density with halo mass for\nsatellite galaxies, while a significant population of low mass centrals is\nfound at high densities in the neighbourhood of massive haloes. In this case\nthe density simply traces the mass of the most massive halo within the\naperture. To identify central and satellite galaxies, we apply an\nobservationally motivated stellar mass rank method which is both highly pure\nand complete, especially in the more massive haloes where such a division is\nmost meaningful. Finally we examine a test case for the recovery of\nenvironmental trends: the passive fraction of galaxies and its dependence on\nstellar and halo mass for centrals and satellites. With careful calibration,\nobservationally defined quantities do a good job of recovering known trends in\nthe model. This result stands even with reduced redshift accuracy, provided the\nsample is deep enough to preserve a wide dynamic range of density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 20:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We propose a method to circumvent them by a simple modification of the\ndensity of state method. We first argue that the standard version of the\ndensity of state method, which is invented to solve the overlapping problem, is\neffective only for a certain `good' class of observables. We then modify it so\nas to solve the overlap problem for `bad' observables as well. While, in the\nstandard version of the density of state method, we usually constrain an\nobservable we are interested in, we fix a different observable in our new\nmethod which has a sharp peak at some particular value characterizing the\ncorrect vacuum of the target theory. In the finite-density QCD, such an\nobservable is the pion condensate. The average phase becomes vanishingly small\nas the value of the pion condensate becomes large, hence it is enough to\nconsider configurations with small values of pion condensate, where the zero\nmode does not appear. We demonstrate an effectiveness of our method by using a\ntoy model (the chiral random matrix theory) which captures the properties of\nfinite-density QCD qualitatively. We also argue how to apply our method to\nother theories including finite-density QCD. Although the example we study\nnumerically is based on the phase reweighting method, the same idea can be\napplied to more general reweighting methods and we show how this idea can be\napplied to find a possible QCD critical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Oct 2014 20:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-29"}

While hydrophobic hydration is\nthe predominant contribution governing the phase behavior of PNiPAM in the\nwater-rich regime, the mixing contributions governing the phase behavior of\nclassical polymer solutions determine the phase behavior of PNiPAM in the\nalcohol-rich regime. This is evidenced by distinct scaling relations denoting\nthe energetic state of the aqueous medium as a key parameter for the phase\nbehavior of PNiPAM in the water-rich regime, while the volume fractions of\nrespectively water, alcohol and PNiPAM become relevant parameters in the\nalcohol-rich regime. Adding alcohol to water decreases the energetics of the\naqueous medium, which gradually suppresses hydrophobic hydration, while adding\nwater to alcohol decreases the solvent quality.

By modeling the spatial locations of nodes based on\nstochastic geometry, analytical expressions for the ergodic spectral efficiency\nof a typical node pair are derived as a function of the channel state\ninformation available at a receiver (CSIR) in terms of relevant system\nparameters: the density of communication links, the number of receive antennas,\nthe path loss exponent, and the operating signal-to-noise ratio. One key\nfinding is that when the receiver only exploits CSIR for the direct link, the\nsum of spectral efficiencies linearly improves as the density increases, when\nthe number of receive antennas increases as a certain super-linear function of\nthe density. When each receiver exploits CSIR for a set of dominant interfering\nlinks in addition to the direct link, the sum of spectral efficiencies linearly\nincreases with both the density and the path loss exponent if the number of\nantennas is a linear function of the density. This observation demonstrates\nthat having CSIR for dominant interfering links provides a multiplicative gain\nin the scaling law. It is also shown that this linear scaling holds for direct\nCSIR when incorporating the effect of the receive antenna correlation, provided\nthat the rank of the spatial correlation matrix scales super-linearly with the\ndensity.

For the\nre-acceleration process, standard DSA theory in the test particle limit\nproduces a steady state particle spectrum that is too flat compared to\nobservations, which suggests that the high energy part of the observed spectrum\nhas not yet reached a steady state.

Commonly the state of these systems is not\ndirectly observed, but only available through noisy and potentially\nhigh-dimensional observations. In these cases, system identification, i.e.,\nfinding the measurement mapping and the transition mapping (system dynamics) in\nlatent space can be challenging. For linear system dynamics and measurement\nmappings efficient solutions for system identification are available. However,\nin practical applications, the linearity assumptions does not hold, requiring\nnon-linear system identification techniques. If additionally the observations\nare high-dimensional (e.g., images), non-linear system identification is\ninherently hard. To address the problem of non-linear system identification\nfrom high-dimensional observations, we combine recent advances in deep learning\nand system identification. In particular, we jointly learn a low-dimensional\nembedding of the observation by means of deep auto-encoders and a predictive\ntransition model in this low-dimensional space.

In particular,\nmulti-component analysis where one component is a blackbody representing\nemission from a photosphere has enabled both a more detailed understanding of\nthe energy content of the jet as well as the ability to examine the dynamic\nstructure of the outflow. While the existence of a blackbody-like component has\nbeen shown to be significant and not a byproduct of background fluctuations, it\nis very possible that it can be an artifact of spectral evolution of a single\ncomponent that is being poorly resolved in time. Herein, this possibility is\ntested by simulating a single component evolving in time and then folding the\nspectra through the $Fermi$ detector response to generate time-tagged event\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) data. We then fit both the time integrated and\nresolved generated spectral data with a multi-component model using standard\ntools.

Silicon detectors are used in\nparticle physics as well as imaging for pixel based detecting systems. Over the\npast twenty years a lot of experimental efforts have been focused on the\neffects of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation on silicon pixels. Some of this\nresearch was done in the framework of high luminosity particle physics\nexperiments, along with radiation hardness studies of basic semiconductors\ndevices. In its simplest form the semiconductor pixel detectors reduce to a PIN\nor PN structure partially or totally depleted, or in some MOS and APD\n(Avalanche PhotoDiode) structures. Bulk or surface defects affect considerably\ntransport of free carriers. We propose guidelines for pixel design, which will\nbe tested through a few pixel structures. This design method includes into the\ndesign the properties of defects. The electrical properties reduce to\nparameters, which can be introduced in a standard simulation code to make\npredictive simulations. We include an analytical model for defect annealing\nderived from isochronal annealing experiments. The proposed method can be used\nto study pixels detectors with different geometrical structures and made with\ndifferent semiconducting materials. Its purpose is to provide an alternative to\ntedious and extensive radiation tests on final fabricated detectors. This is\nnecessary for the long-term reliability of detectors together with their\nradiation tolerance. A general method for pixel design is introduced and we\nwill show how it can be used for the design of alternate to silicon (germanium)\npixels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 09:44:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 14:48:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 17:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-02"}

Alignments between these networks aid\nfunctional understanding as they uncover important information, such as\nevolutionary conserved pathways, protein complexes and functional orthologs.\nThe objective of a multiple network alignment is to create clusters of nodes\nthat are evolutionarily conserved and functionally consistent across all\nnetworks. Unfortunately, the alignment methods proposed thus far do not fully\nmeet this objective, as they are guided by pairwise scores that do not utilize\nthe entire functional and topological information across all networks. To\novercome this weakness, we propose FUSE, a multiple network aligner that\nutilizes all functional and topological information in all PPI networks. It\nworks in two steps. First, it computes novel similarity scores of proteins\nacross the PPI networks by fusing from all aligned networks both the protein\nwiring patterns and their sequence similarities. It does this by using\nNon-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization (NMTF). When we apply NMTF on the five\nlargest and most complete PPI networks from BioGRID, we show that NMTF finds a\nlarger number of protein pairs across the PPI networks that are functionally\nconserved than can be found by using protein sequence similarities alone. This\ndemonstrates complementarity of protein sequence and their wiring patterns in\nthe PPI networks. In the second step, FUSE uses a novel maximum weight\nk-partite matching approximation algorithm to find an alignment between\nmultiple networks. We compare FUSE with the state of the art multiple network\naligners and show that it produces the largest number of functionally\nconsistent clusters that cover all aligned PPI networks.

We aim to estimate the orientation\nmeasurements of the disk, such as the inclination and the position angle of the\nline of nodes, and the depth of the disk. We used the V and I band photometric\ndata of the fundamental and first-overtone Cepheids from the Optical\nGravitational Lensing Experiment survey. The period-luminosity relations were\nused to estimate the relative distance and reddening of each Cepheid. A\nweighted least-square plane fitting method was then applied to estimate the\nstructural parameters. The line-of-sight depth and then the orientation\ncorrected depth or thickness of the disk were estimated from the relative\ndistance measurements. The period-age-colour relation of Cepheids were used to\nderive the age of the Cepheids. A break in the PL relations of the\nfundamental-mode and first-overtone Cepheids at P ~ 2.95 days and P ~ 1 day are\nobserved. An inclination of 64$^o$.4$\\pm$0$^o$.7 and a\nPA$_{lon}$=155$^o$.3$\\pm$6$^o$.3 are obtained from the full sample. A reddening\nmap of the SMC disk is also presented. The orientation-corrected depth or\nthickness of the SMC disk is found to be 1.76 $\\pm$ 0.6 kpc. The scale height\nis estimated to be 0.82 $\\pm$ 0.3 kpc.

The radial variation of the disk parameters\nmildly indicate structures/disturbances in the inner SMC (0.5 $<$ r $<$ 2.5\ndegree).

For example, bistability is\nfound in many reaction networks that involve the control and execution of\nimportant biological functions, such as signalling processes. Positive feedback\nloops, composed of species and reactions, are necessary for bistability, and\ngenerally for multi-stationarity, to occur. These loops are therefore often\nused to illustrate and pinpoint the parts of a multi-stationary network that\nare relevant (`responsible') for the observed multi-stationarity. However\npositive feedback loops are generally abundant in reaction networks but not all\nof them are important for subsequent interpretation of the network's dynamics.\n  We present an automated procedure to determine the relevant positive feedback\nloops of a multi-stationary reaction network. The procedure only reports the\nloops that are relevant for multi-stationarity (that is, when broken\nmulti-stationarity disappears) and not all positive feedback loops of the\nnetwork.

Generally, the empirical Band\nfunction is fit to the observed gamma-ray data and the fit parameters are used\nto infer which radiative mechanisms are at work in GRB outflows. In particular,\nthe distribution of the Band function's low-energy power law index, $\\alpha$,\nhas led to the so-called synchrotron \"line-of-death\" (LOD) which is a statement\nthat the distribution cannot be explained by the simplest of synchrotron models\nalone. As an alternatively fitting model, a combination of a blackbody in\naddition to the Band function is used, which in many cases provide a better or\nequally good fit. It has been suggested that such fits would be able to\nalleviate the LOD problem for synchrotron emission in GRBs. However, these\nconclusions rely on the Band function's ability to fit a synchrotron spectrum\nwithin the observed energy band. In order to investigate if this is the case,\nwe simulate synchrotron and synchrotron+blackbody spectra and fold them through\nthe instrumental response of the $Fermi$ Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). We then\nperform a standard data analysis by fitting the simulated data with both Band\nand Band+blackbody models. We find two important results: the synchrotron LOD\nis actually more severe than the original predictions: $\\alpha_{\\bf LOD} \\sim\n-0.8$. Moreover, we find that intrinsic synchrotron+blackbody emission is\ninsufficient to account for the entire observed $\\alpha$ distribution. This\nimplies that some other emission mechanism(s) are required to explain a large\nfraction of observed GRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 15:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-29"}

Eventually the kinetic energy does no\nlonger enable the excitation to cross over the minimum energy barrier between\nneighboring sites, and the excitation becomes localized within a lattice cell.\nIn the case of a protein, the lattice structure consists of the C-alpha\nbackbone. The self-localized quasiparticle excitation is the elemental building\nblock of loops. It can be modeled by a kink which solves a variant of the\ndiscrete non-linear Schroedinger equation (DNLS). We study the propagation of\nsuch a kink in the case of protein G related albumin-binding domain, using the\nUNRES coarse-grained molecular dynamics force field. We estimate the height of\nthe energy barriers the kink needs to cross over, in order to propagate along\nthe backbone lattice. We analyse how these barriers gives rise to both stresses\nand reliefs which control the kink movement. For this, we deform a natively\nfolded protein structure by parallel translating the kink along the backbone\naway from its native position. We release the transposed kink, and we follow\nhow it propagates along the backbone towards the native location.

Three main cases are\npresented in order of increasing complexity: a simple case wherein viscosity is\nonly dependent on grainsize, a case where viscosity depends on temperature and\ngrainsize, and finally a case where viscosity is temperature and grainsize\nsensitive, and the grain-growth (or healing) is also temperature sensitive. In\nall cases, convection with grain-damage scales differently than Newtonian\nconvection due to the effects of grain-damage. For the fully realistic case,\nnumerical results show stagnant lid convection, fully mobilized convection that\nresembles the temperature-independent viscosity case, and partially mobile or\ntransitional convection, depending on damage to healing ratio, Rayleigh number,\nand the activation energies for viscosity and healing. Applying our scaling\nlaws for the fully realistic case to Earth and Venus we demonstrate that\nincreasing surface temperature dramatically decreases plate speed and heat\nflow, essentially shutting down plate tectonics, due to increased healing in\nlithospheric shear zones, as proposed previously. Contrary to many previous\nstudies, the transitional regime between the stagnant lid and fully mobilized\nregimes is large, and the transition from stagnant lid to mobile convection is\ngradual and continuous.

This allows the WD\nto accrete at rates of $10^{-8} - 10^{-7}$ M(Sun)/year, and thus to power its\nluminosity.\n  Conclusions: We show that the high wind-mass-transfer efficiency in S-type\nsymbiotic stars can be caused by compression of the wind from their slowly\nrotating normal giants, whereas in D-type symbiotic stars, the high mass\ntransfer ratio can be achieved via the gravitational focusing, which has\nrecently been suggested for very slow winds in Mira-type binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 15:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

Recent work has shown\nthat, with a polynomial parameterisation of the WIMP speed distribution, it is\npossible to make an unbiased measurement of the WIMP mass, without making any\nastrophysical assumptions. However, direct detection experiments are not\nsensitive to low-speed WIMPs and, therefore, any model-independent approach\nwill lead to a bias in the cross section. This problem can be solved with the\naddition of measurements of the flux of neutrinos from the Sun. This is because\nthe flux of neutrinos produced from the annihilation of WIMPs which have been\ngravitationally captured in the Sun is sensitive to low-speed WIMPs. Using mock\ndata from next-generation direct detection experiments and from the IceCube\nneutrino telescope, we show that the complementary information from IceCube on\nlow-speed WIMPs breaks the degeneracy between the cross section and the speed\ndistribution. This allows unbiased determinations of the WIMP mass and\nspin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections to be made, and the speed\ndistribution to be reconstructed. We use two parameterisations of the speed\ndistribution: binned and polynomial. While the polynomial parameterisation can\nencompass a wider range of speed distributions, this leads to larger\nuncertainties in the particle physics parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 10:57:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 May 2015 08:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}
