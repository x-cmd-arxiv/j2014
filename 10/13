The setup is a simplified\ncanister box where the powder is dosed out of the box through the action of a\nconstant-pitch screw feeder connected to a motor. A dose consists of a rotation\nstep followed by a period of rest before the next dosage.\n  From the experiments, we report on the operational performance of the dosing\nprocess through a variation of dosage time, coil pitch and initial powder mass.\nWe find that the dosed mass shows an increasing linear dependence on the dosage\ntime and rotation speed. In contrast, the mass output from the canister is not\ndirectly proportional to an increase/decrease in the number coils. By\ncalibrating the interparticle friction and cohesion, we show that DEM\nsimulation can quantitatively reproduce the experimental findings for smaller\nmasses but also overestimate arching and blockage. With appropriate\nhomogenization tools, further insights into microstructure and macroscopic\nfields can be obtained.\n  This work shows that particle scaling and the adaptation of particle\nproperties is a viable approach to overcome the untreatable number of particles\ninherent in experiments with fine, cohesive powders and opens the gateway to\nsimulating their flow in more complex geometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 09:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

To better understand the nature of co-variability in\nneural circuits and their impact on cortical information processing, we need\nstatistical models that are able to capture multiple sources of variability on\ndifferent time-scales. Here, we introduce a hierarchical statistical model of\nneural population activity which models both neural population dynamics as well\nas inter-trial modulations in firing rates.

Together with a logical knowledge base, effectively a logical program\nconsisting of logical facts and rules, it induces a ground LP. This ground LP\nis solved using lifted linear programming. That is, symmetries within the\nground LP are employed to reduce its dimensionality, if possible, and the\nreduced program is solved using any off-the-shelf LP solver. In contrast to\nmainstream LP template languages like AMPL, which features a mixture of\ndeclarative and imperative programming styles, RLP's relational nature allows a\nmore intuitive representation of optimization problems over relational domains.\nWe illustrate this empirically by experiments on approximate inference in\nMarkov logic networks using LP relaxations, on solving Markov decision\nprocesses, and on collective inference using LP support vector machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Oct 2014 18:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

Given that data are\nreplicated in multiple geographically distributed data centers, and to meet the\nincreasing requirements of distributed applications, many cloud data stores\nadopt eventual consistency and therefore allow to run data intensive operations\nunder low latency.

For any $d>0$, we determine the\nirreducible components of the varieties that parametrize the $d$-dimensional\nrepresentations of $\\Lambda$, namely, the components of the classical affine\nvariety ${\\rm\\bf{Rep}}_{d}(\\Lambda)$ and -- equivalently -- those of the\nprojective parametrizing variety ${\\rm GRASS}_d(\\Lambda)$. Our method is to\ncorner the components by way of a twin pair of upper semicontinuous maps from\n${\\rm\\bf{Rep}}_{d}(\\Lambda)$ to a poset consisting of sequences of semisimple\nmodules.\n  An excerpt of the main result is as follows. Given a sequence ${\\bf S} =\n({\\bf S}_0, ..., {\\bf S}_L)$ of semisimple modules with $\\dim \\bigoplus_{0 \\le\nl \\le L} {\\bf S}_l = d$, let ${\\rm\\bf{Rep}}\\, {\\bf S}$ be the subvariety of\n${\\rm\\bf{Rep}}_{d}(\\Lambda)$ consisting of the points that parametrize the\nmodules with radical layering ${\\bf S}$.

A new insight in\nthis note is that the local cluster coefficient C(x) in a finite simple graph\ncan be written as a relative characteristic length L(x) of the unit sphere S(x)\nwithin the unit ball B(x) of a vertex. This relation L(x) = 2-C(x) will allow\nto study clustering in more general metric spaces like Riemannian manifolds or\nfractals.

We study\nsome explicit models on these types of noncommutative spaces, first by\nutilising the perturbation theory, later in an exact manner.

More investigations into the comparison are\ncarried out by a qualitative comparison between the dynamics of the classical\nparticle and that of the coherent states based on numerical techniques.

Here we present the first coherent quench\nmeasurements of the dynamical transition to the pseudogap state in the\nprototype high temperature superconductor\nBi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\\delta}$, revealing a marked absence of\nincipient collective ordering beyond a few coherence lengths on short\ntimescales at any level of doping.

We\nemploy both semi-analytic methods and two dimensional numerical simulations,\nfocusing on the case where the binary mass ratio is small but large enough to\nsignificantly perturb the disk. We develop the theory of type I migration for\nthis case and determine conditions for gap formation finding that then inward\nmigration occurs on a time scale equal to the time required for one half of the\nsecondary mass to be accreted through the unperturbed disk, with accretion onto\nthe secondary playing only a minor role. The semi-analytic and fully numerical\napproaches are in good agreement, the former being applicable over long time\nscales. Inward migration induced by interaction with the disk alleviates the\nfinal parsec problem. Accretion onto the secondary does not significantly\naffect the orbital evolution, but may have observational consequences for high\naccretion efficiency. The binary may then appear as two sources of radiation\nrotating around each other. This study should be extended to consider orbits\nwith significant eccentricity and the effects of gravitational radiation at\nsmall length scales.

The most favored interpretation\nof these anomalies is that CDM substructures present in lensing galaxies\nperturb the lens potentials and alter image magnifications and thus flux\nratios. So far no consensus has emerged regarding whether or not the predicted\nCDM substructure abundance fully accounts for the lensing flux anomaly\nobservations. Accurate modeling relies on a realistic lens sample in terms of\nboth the lens environment and internal structures and substructures. In this\npaper we construct samples of generalised and specific lens potentials, to\nwhich we add (rescaled) subhalo populations from the galaxy-scale Aquarius and\nthe cluster-scale Phoenix simulation suites. We further investigate the lensing\neffects from subhalos of masses several orders of magnitude below the\nsimulation resolution limit. The resulting flux ratio distributions are\ncompared to the currently best available sample of radio lenses. The observed\nanomalies in B0128+437, B0712+472 and B1555+375 are more likely to be caused by\npropagation effects or oversimplified lens modeling, signs of which are already\nseen in the data. Among the quadruple systems that have closely located image\ntriplets/pairs, the anomalous flux ratios of MG0414+0534 can be reproduced by\nadding CDM subhalos to its macroscopic lens potential, with a probability of\n5%-20%; for B0712+472, B1422+231, B1555+375 and B2045+265, these probabilities\nare only of a few percent. We hence find that CDM substructures are unlikely to\nbe the whole reason for radio flux anomalies. We discuss other possible effects\nthat might also be at work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 12:34:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 14:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 18:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We begin with an initial set of active vertices. The\nprocess then proceeds in rounds, and further vertices become active as soon as\nthey have a certain number of active neighbors. A recurring feature in\nbootstrap percolation theory is an `all-or-nothing' phenomenon: either the size\nof the starting set is so small that the process stops very soon, or it\npercolates (almost) completely.\n  Motivated by several important phenomena observed in various types of\nreal-world networks we propose in this work a variant of bootstrap percolation\nthat exhibits a vastly different behavior. Our graphs have two types of\nvertices: some of them obstruct the diffusion, while the others facilitate it.\nWe study the effect of this setting by analyzing the process on\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs. Our main findings are two-fold. First we show\nthat the presence of vertices hindering the diffusion does not result in a\nstable behavior: tiny changes in the size of the starting set can dramatically\ninfluence the size of the final active set. In particular, the process is\nnon-monotone: a larger starting set can result in a smaller final set. In the\nsecond part of the paper we show that this phenomenom arises from the\nround-based approach: if we move to a continuous time model in which every edge\ndraws its transmission time randomly, then we gain stability, and the process\nstops with an active set that contains a non-trivial constant fraction of all\nvertices. Moreover, we show that in the continuous time model percolation\noccurs significantly faster compared to the classical round-based model. Our\nfindings are in line with empirical observations and demonstrate the importance\nof introducing various types of vertex behaviors in the mathematical model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 13:00:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2015 15:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-24"}

Typically, existing methods use a node\ncost function (NCF) to compute similarity between nodes in different networks\nand an alignment strategy (AS) to find high-scoring alignments with respect to\nthe total NCF over all aligned nodes (or node conservation). But, they then\nevaluate quality of their alignments via some other measure that is different\nthan the node conservation measure used to guide the alignment construction\nprocess. Typically, one measures the amount of conserved edges, but only after\nalignments are produced. Hence, a recent attempt aimed to directly maximize the\namount of conserved edges while constructing alignments, which improved\nalignment accuracy. Here, we aim to directly maximize both node and edge\nconservation during alignment construction to further improve alignment\naccuracy. For this, we design a novel measure of edge conservation that (unlike\nexisting measures that treat each conserved edge the same) weighs each\nconserved edge so that edges with highly NCF-similar end nodes are favored. As\na result, we introduce a novel AS, Weighted Alignment VotEr (WAVE), which can\noptimize any measures of node and edge conservation, and which can be used with\nany NCF or combination of multiple NCFs. Using WAVE on top of established\nstate-of-the-art NCFs leads to superior alignments compared to the existing\nmethods that optimize only node conservation or only edge conservation or that\ntreat each conserved edge the same. And while we evaluate WAVE in the\ncomputational biology domain, it is easily applicable in any domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 13:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

Previous example-based super-resolution approaches\nmainly focus on analyzing the co-occurrence properties of low resolution and\nhigh-resolution patches. Recently, we proposed a novel single image\nsuper-resolution approach based on linear manifold approximation of the\nhigh-resolution image-patch space [1]. The image super-resolution problem is\nthen formulated as an optimization problem of searching for the best matched\nhigh resolution patch in the manifold for a given low-resolution patch. We\ndeveloped a novel technique based on the l1 norm sparse graph to learn a set of\nlow dimensional affine spaces or tangent subspaces of the high-resolution patch\nmanifold. The optimization problem is then solved based on the learned set of\ntangent subspaces. In this paper, we build on our recent work as follows.\nFirst, we consider and analyze each tangent subspace as one point in a\nGrassmann manifold, which helps to compute geodesic pairwise distances among\nthese tangent subspaces. Second, we develop a min-max algorithm to select an\noptimal subset of tangent subspaces. This optimal subset reduces the\ncomputational cost while still preserving the quality of the reconstructed\nhigh-resolution image. Third, and to further achieve lower computational\ncomplexity, we perform hierarchical clustering on the optimal subset based on\nGrassmann manifold distances. Finally, we analytically prove the validity of\nthe proposed Grassmann-distance based clustering.

Now we use NuSTAR to probe the lag at higher energies, where the\nspectrum shows clear evidence for Compton reflection, known as the Compton\n'hump'. The XMM-Newton data show Fe K lags in both SWIFT J2127.4+5654 and NGC\n1365. The NuSTAR data provide independent confirmation of these Fe K lags, and\nalso show evidence for the corresponding Compton hump lags, especially in SWIFT\nJ2127.4+5654. These broadband lag measurements confirm that the Compton hump\nand Fe K lag are produced at small radii. At low-frequencies in NGC 1365, where\nthe spectrum shows evidence for eclipsing clouds in the line of sight, we find\na clear negative (not positive) lag from 2--10 keV, which can be understood as\nthe decrease in column density from a neutral eclipsing cloud moving out of our\nline of sight during the observation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 15:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

This game leads\nto define two new invariants for a graph $G$, which are the minimum numbers of\ncolors needed to ensure that the Gentle has a winning strategy, depending on\nwho starts. These invariants could be infinite, thus we start by giving\nsufficient conditions to have infinite game distinguishing numbers.

In particular, in the former, Terao's open problem\nasking whether freeness depends only on combinatorics is true. A long standing\nproblem whether all free arrangements are recursively free or not was settled\nby the second author and Hoge very recently, by giving a free but\nnon-recursively free plane arrangement consisting of 27 planes. In this paper,\nwe construct free but non-recursively free plane arrangements consisting of 13\nand 15 planes, and show that the example with 13 planes is the smallest in the\nsense of the cardinality of planes. In other words, all free plane arrangements\nconsisting of at most 12 planes are recursively free. To show this, we\ncompletely classify all free plane arrangements in terms of inductive freeness\nand three exceptions when the number of planes is at most 12. Several\nproperties of the 15 plane arrangement are proved by computer programs. Also,\nthese two examples solve negatively a problem posed by Yoshinaga on the moduli\nspaces, (inductive) freeness and, rigidity of free arrangements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 14:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-14"}
