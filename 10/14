Our main result is that\nlog-volatility behaves essentially as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst\nexponent H of order 0.1, at any reasonable time scale. This leads us to adopt\nthe fractional stochastic volatility (FSV) model of Comte and Renault. We call\nour model Rough FSV (RFSV) to underline that, in contrast to FSV, H<1/2. We\ndemonstrate that our RFSV model is remarkably consistent with financial time\nseries data; one application is that it enables us to obtain improved forecasts\nof realized volatility. Furthermore, we find that although volatility is not\nlong memory in the RFSV model, classical statistical procedures aiming at\ndetecting volatility persistence tend to conclude the presence of long memory\nin data generated from it. This sheds light on why long memory of volatility\nhas been widely accepted as a stylized fact. Finally, we provide a quantitative\nmarket microstructure-based foundation for our findings, relating the roughness\nof volatility to high frequency trading and order splitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 17:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

Combining a parametric exploration and an\nenergy analysis of incompressible nonlinear MRI dynamo cycles representative of\nthe transitional dynamics in large aspect ratio shearing boxes, we find that\nturbulent magnetic diffusion makes the excitation and sustainment of this\ndynamo at moderate magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) increasingly difficult for\ndecreasing Pm. This results in an increase in the critical Rm of the dynamo for\nincreasing kinematic Reynolds number (Re), in agreement with earlier numerical\nresults.

However,\nin the unbounded setting, the space of multipliers has the structure of a\n*-algebra with nice properties concerning commutant and affiliation: it is a\npre-GW*-algebra. And this correspondence between Hilbert algebras and its\nmultipliers is functorial. Then, we can endow the Hilbert algebra with a nice\ntopology constructed from unbounded multipliers. As we can see from the theory\ndeveloped here, multipliers should be an important tool for the study of\nunbounded operator algebras.\n  We also formalize the remark that examples of non-formal deformation\nquantizations give rise to Hilbert algebras, by defining the concept of Hilbert\ndeformation quantization (HDQ) and studying these deformations as well as their\nbounded and unbounded multipliers in a general way. Then, we reformulate the\nnotion of covariance of a star-product in this framework of HDQ and\nmultipliers, and we call it a symmetry of the HDQ. By using the multiplier\ntopology of a symmetry, we are able to produce various functional spaces\nattached to the deformation quantization, like the generalization of Schwartz\nspace, Sobolev spaces, Gracia-Bondia-Varilly spaces. Moreover, the non-formal\nstar-exponential of the symmetry can be defined in full generality and has nice\nrelations with these functional spaces.

These\noriginate in the frustrated nature of the interactions between the spins. For\nclassical spins the magnetization is discontinuous in a magnetic field. Here we\nexamine the importance of the connectivity of the icosahedron for the\nappearance of the magnetization discontinuity, and also investigate the\ntransition from the classical to the quantum limit. The influence of\nconnectivity on the magnetic properties is revealed by considering the cluster\nas being made up of a closed strip of a triangular lattice with two additional\nspins attached. The classical magnetization discontinuity is shown to evolve\ncontinuously from the discontinuity effected by these two spins when they are\nuncoupled to the cluster. In the second part the transition from the classical\nto the quantum limit is examined by focusing on the low energy spectrum taking\nfully into account the spatial and the spin symmetry of the model in the\ncharacterization of the states. A symmetry analysis of the highly degenerate\ndue to the connectivity lowest energy classical manifold identifies as its\ndirect fingerprint the low energy quantum states for spin magnitude as low as\n$s=1$, with the latter following a tower of states behavior which relates to\nthe icosahedron having a structure reminiscent of a depleted triangular\nlattice. The classical character of the AHM for small $s$ is also detected on\nthe ground state energy and correlation functions. On the other hand the\nclassical magnetization discontinuity in a field eventually disappears for\nsmall $s$, after a weak reentrant behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 19:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We address some properties of this type of systems by using a\nSlater-Koster tight-binding model. We predict that topological\nsuperconductivity is nearly universal when ferromagnetic transition metal\nchains form straight lines on superconducting substrates and that it is\npossible for more complex chain structures. The proximity induced\nsuperconducting gap is $\\sim \\Delta E_{so} / J$ where $\\Delta$ is the $s$-wave\npair-potential on the chain, $E_{so}$ is the spin-orbit splitting energy\ninduced in the normal chain state bands by hybridization with the\nsuperconducting substrate, and $J$ is the exchange-splitting of the\nferromagnetic chain $d$-bands. Because of the topological character of the 1D\nsuperconducting state, Majorana end modes appear within the gaps of finite\nlength chains. We find, in agreement with experiment, that when the chain and\nsubstrate orbitals are strongly hybridized, Majorana end modes are\nsubstantially reduced in amplitude when separated from the chain end by less\nthan the coherence length defined by the $p$-wave superconducting gap. We\nconclude that Pb is a particularly favorable substrate material for\nferromagnetic chain topological superconductivity because it provides both\nstrong $s-$wave pairing and strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling, but that there\nis an opportunity to optimize properties by varying the atomic composition and\nstructure of the chain. Finally, we note that in the absence of disorder a new\nchain magnetic symmetry, one that is also present in the crystalline\ntopological insulators, can stabilize multiple Majorana modes at the end of a\nsingle chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 19:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 14:32:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 17:35:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-08"}

In earlier work, it has been\nsuggested that the power released by fast reconnection events between the\nmagnetic field lines lifting from the inner accretion disk region and the lines\nanchored into the central black hole could accelerate relativistic particles\nand produce the observed radio emission from microquasars and low luminosity\nAGNs (LLAGNs). Moreover, it has been proposed that the observed correlation\nbetween the radio emission and the mass of these sources, spanning $10^{10}$\norders of magnitude in mass, might be related to this process. In the present\nwork, we revisit this model comparing two different fast magnetic reconnection\nmechanisms, namely, fast reconnection driven by anomalous resistivity (AR) and\nby turbulence (as described in Lazarian and Vishiniac 1999). We apply the\nscenario above to a much larger sample of sources (including also blazars, and\ngamma-ray bursts - GRBs), and find that LLAGNs and microquasars do confirm the\ntrend above. Furthermore, when driven by turbulence, not only their radio but\nalso their gamma-ray emission can be due to magnetic power released by fast\nreconnection, which may accelerate particles to relativistic velocities in the\ncore region of these sources. Thus the turbulent-driven fast reconnection model\nis able to reproduce better the observed emission than the AR model. On the\nother hand, the emission from blazars and GRBs does not follow the same trend\nas that of the LLAGNs and microquasars, suggesting that the radio and gamma-ray\nemission in these cases is produced further out along the jet, by another\npopulation of relativistic particles, as expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 19:44:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 23:35:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 15:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

In this paper we perform a comprehensive exploration of these\nsignals and their covariances through a combination of analytic and numerical\napproaches. First, we derive analytic expressions for the projected galaxy\ncorrelation function and stacked tangential shear profile and their respective\ncovariances, which include Gaussian and discreteness noise terms. Secondly, we\nmeasure these quantities from mock galaxy catalogues obtained from the\nMillennium-XXL simulation and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.

On smaller scales (R<5 Mpc/h) the bias is a complicated function\nof scale and luminosity, determined by the different spatial distribution and\nabundance of satellite galaxies present when different magnitude cuts are\napplied, as well as by the mass dependence of the host haloes on magnitude. Our\ntheoretical model for the covariances provides a reasonably good description of\nthe measured ones on small and large scales.

Investigations of a broad parameter space indicate\nthat: accretion of Earth was heterogeneous, metal-silicate equilibration\npressures increase as accretion progresses and are 60-70% of core-mantle\nboundary pressures at the time of each impact, and a large fraction (70-100%)\nof the metal of impactor cores equilibrates with a small fraction of the\nsilicate mantles of protoplanets during each core formation event. Acceptable\nfits to the Earth's mantle composition are obtained only when bodies that\noriginated close to the Sun, at <0.9-1.2 AU, are highly reduced and those\nbeyond this distance are increasingly oxidized. The FeO content of the Martian\nmantle depends critically on the heliocentric distance at which the\nMars-forming embryo originated. Finally, the Earth's core is predicted to\ncontain 8-9 wt% silicon, 2-4 wt% oxygen and 10-60 ppm hydrogen, whereas the\nMartian core is predicted to contain low concentrations (<1 wt%) of Si and O.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 20:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-25"}

While many analytic results have been reported for the case of\nlarge networks, very few of them are readily applicable to finite-size\nnetworks. This paper studies cascading failures in finite-size geometric\nnetworks where the number of nodes is on the order of tens or hundreds as in\nmany real-life networks. First, the impact of the tolerance parameter on\nnetwork resiliency is investigated. We quantify the network reaction to initial\ndisturbances of different sizes by measuring the damage imposed on the network.\nLower and upper bounds on the number of failures are derived to characterize\nsuch damages. Such finite-size analysis reveals the decisiveness and\ncriticality of taking action within the first few stages of failure propagation\nin preventing a cascade. By studying the trend of the bounds as the number of\nnodes increases, we observe a phase transition phenomenon in terms of the\ntolerance parameter. The critical value of the tolerance parameter, known as\nthe threshold, is further derived. The findings of this paper, in particular,\nshed light on how to choose the tolerance parameter appropriately such that a\ncascade of failures could be avoided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 20:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-15"}

The SE subcluster has more prominent filamentary\nstructures and more complicated kinematics compared to the NW subcluster.

Close approximations may be difficult to achieve using analytic\nsolutions, however, and thus Monte Carlo approaches, including both simulation\nand bootstrap resampling, are often attractive. One setting in which this is\nparticularly true is cluster-randomized trial designs. However, Monte Carlo\napproaches are useful in many additional settings as well. Calculating power\nfor cluster-randomized trials using analytic or simulation-based methods is\nfrequently unsatisfactory due to the complexity of the data analysis methods to\nbe employed and to the sparseness of data to inform the choice of important\nparameters in these methods.\n  Methods\n  We propose that among Monte Carlo methods, bootstrap approaches are most\nlikely to generate data similar to the observed data.

For simultaneous\nobservation of multiple ECE frequencies from the outside edge of a toroidal\nplasma confinement device (e.g. a tokamak), the focal length of the collecting\noptics should increase with the frequency to maximize the resolution on a line\nof sight along the magnetic field gradient. Here we present the design and\nnumerical study of a zoned metamaterial lens with such characteristics, for\npossible deployment with the 83-130 GHz ECE radiometer in the DIII-D tokamak.\nThe lens consists of a concentric array of miniaturized element phase-shifters.\nThese were reverse-engineered starting from the desired Gaussian beam waist\nlocations and further optimized to account for diffraction and finite-aperture\neffects that tend to displace the waist. At the same time we imposed high and\nuniform transmittance, averaged over all phase-shifters. The focal length is\nshown to increase from 1.37 m to 1.97 m over the frequency range of interest,\nas desired for low-field DIII-D discharges (B = -1.57 T). Retracting the lens\nto receded positions rigidly moves the waists accordingly, resulting in a good\nmatch -within a fraction of the Rayleigh length- of the EC-emitting layer\npositions at higher fields (up to B = -2.00 T). Further, it is shown how\nvarying the lens aperture might move the waists \"non-rigidly\" to better match\nthe non-rigid movement of the EC-emitting layers with the magnetic field. The\nnumerical method presented is very general and can be used to engineer any\ndependence of the focal length on the frequency, including zero or minimal\nchromatic aberration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 22:33:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-15"}

Bayesian inference methods produce a\nsample of phylogenetic trees from the posterior distribution given sequence\ndata. Hence the question of statistical consistency of such methods is\nequivalent to the consistency of the summary of the sample. More generally,\nstatistical consistency is ensured by the tree space used to analyse the\nsample.\n  In this paper, we consider two standard parameterisations of phylogenetic\ntime-trees used in evolutionary models: inter-coalescent interval lengths and\nabsolute times of divergence events. For each of these parameterisations we\nintroduce a natural metric space on ultrametric phylogenetic trees. We compare\nthe introduced spaces with existing models of tree space and formulate several\nformal requirements that a metric space on phylogenetic trees must possess in\norder to be a satisfactory space for statistical analysis, and justify them. We\nshow that only a few known constructions of the space of phylogenetic trees\nsatisfy these requirements. However, our results suggest that these basic\nrequirements are not enough to distinguish between the two metric spaces we\nintroduce and that the choice between metric spaces requires additional\nproperties to be considered. Particularly, that the summary tree minimising the\nsquare distance to the trees from the sample might be different for different\nparameterisations.

Its peculiarity lies in considering\nrealistic path-loss and blockage models, which are derived from recently\nreported experimental data. The path-loss model accounts for different\ndistributions of line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight propagation conditions and\nthe blockage model includes an outage state that provides a better\nrepresentation of the outage possibilities of millimeter wave communications.\nBy modeling the locations of the base stations as points of a Poisson point\nprocess and by relying on a noise-limited approximation for typical millimeter\nwave network deployments, simple and exact integral as well as approximated and\nclosed-form formulas for computing the coverage probability and the average\nrate are obtained. With the aid of Monte Carlo simulations, the noise-limited\napproximation is shown to be sufficiently accurate for typical network\ndensities.

We find that about two dozens of OGLE-III\nevents (about 1 percent of the total) have maximum polarization degree in the\nrange 0.1 < P_{\\rm max} <1 percent, corresponding to source stars with apparent\nmagnitude I < 14.5, being very cool red giants.This signal is measurable by\nusing the FORS2 polarimeter at VLT telescope with about 1 hour integration\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 07:24:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Recent spectroscopic\nobservations of asymptotic giant branch stars in the GC NGC6752 have disclosed\na low [Na/Fe] abundance for the whole sample, suggesting that they are all\nfirst-generation stars, and that all second-generation stars fail to reach the\nAGB in this cluster. A scenario proposed to explain these observations invokes\nstrong mass loss in second-generation horizontal branch stars possibly induced\nby the metal enhancement associated to radiative levitation. This enhanced mass\nloss would prevent second generation stars from reaching the AGB phase, thus\nexplaining at the same time the low value of the ratio between HB and AGB stars\n(the R_2 parameter) observed in NGC6752. We have critically discussed this\nscenario, finding that the required mass-loss rates are of the order of 10^{-9}\nMo/yr, significantly higher than current theoretical and empirical constraints.\nBy making use of synthetic HB simulations, we demonstrate that our modelling\npredicts correctly the R_2 parameter for NGC6752, without the need to invoke\nvery efficient mass loss during the core He-burning stage. Our simulations for\nNGC6752 HB predict however the presence of a significant fraction - at the\nlevel of about 50% - second generation stars along the cluster AGB. We conclude\nthat there is no simple explanation for the lack of second generation stars in\nthe spectroscopically surveyed sample, although the interplay between mass loss\n(with low rates) and radiative levitation may play a role in explaining this\npuzzle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 08:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

We then compare them to other\npreviously studied weakenings, namely infinitely-often K-triviality and weak\nlowness for K (in each, the defining inequality must hold up to a constant, but\nonly for infinitely many inputs). We show that $\\Delta^0_2$-bounded K-trivial\nimplies infinitely-often K-trivial, but no implication holds between\n$\\Delta^0_2$-bounded low for K and weakly low for K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 08:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-15"}

However, existing systems do not take advantage of\nthe personalization which becomes possible when web-based education is offered:\nthey continue to be one-size-fits-all. In this paper, we aim to provide a first\nsystematic method for designing a personalized web-based education system.\nPersonalizing education is challenging: (i) students need to be provided\npersonalized teaching and training depending on their contexts (e.g. classes\nalready taken, methods of learning preferred, etc.), (ii) for each specific\ncontext, the best teaching and training method (e.g type and order of teaching\nmaterials to be shown) must be learned, (iii) teaching and training should be\nadapted online, based on the scores/feedback (e.g. tests, quizzes, final exam,\nlikes/dislikes etc.) of the students. Our personalized online system, e-Tutor,\nis able to address these challenges by learning how to adapt the teaching\nmethodology (in this case what sequence of teaching material to present to a\nstudent) to maximize her performance in the final exam, while minimizing the\ntime spent by the students to learn the course (and possibly dropouts).

This tradeoff is mainly caused by the multi-photon\npair emissions from the SPDCs. In theory, the problem is how to model the\nexperiments without truncating these multi-photon emissions while including\npractical imperfections.\n  In this paper, we establish a method to theoretically simulate SPDC based\nQIPs which fully incorporates the effect of multi-photon emissions and various\npractical imperfections.

The historical evolution of the pulse phase\naveraged CRSF centroid energy Ecyc since its discovery in 1976 is characterized\nby an initial value around 35 keV, an abrupt jump upwards to beyond about 40\nkeV between 1990 and 1994, and an apparent decay thereafter.

The theory\nincludes mechanisms to account for e-pair coupling in the superconducting and\npseudogap phases and their inter relations observed in these materials.\n  Electron pair coupling in the superconducting phase is facilitated by local\nquantum potentials created by static dopants in a mechanism which explains\nexperimentally observed optimal doping levels and the associated peak in\ncritical temperature. By contrast, evidence suggests that electrons\ncontributing to the pseudogap are predominantly coupled by fractal spin waves\n(fractons) induced by the fractal arrangement of dopants.\n  On another level, the theory offers new insights into the emergence of a\nmacroscopic quantum potential generated by a fractal distribution of dopants.\nThis, in turn, leads to the emergence of coherent, macroscopic spin waves and a\nsecond associated macroscopic quantum potential, possibly supported by charge\norder. These quantum potentials play two key roles. The first involves the\ntransition of an expected diffusive process (normally associated with Anderson\nlocalization) in fractal networks, into e-pair coherence. The second involves\nthe facilitation of tunnelling between localized e-pairs. These combined\neffects lead to the merger of the super conducting and pseudo gap phases into a\nsingle coherent condensate at optimal doping. The underlying theory relating to\nthe diffusion to quantum transition is supported by Coherent Random Lasing,\nwhich can be explained using an analogous approach. As a final step, an\nexperimental program is outlined to validate the theory and suggests a new\napproach to increase the stability of electron pair condensates at higher\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 12:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 10:28:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 16:17:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 13:36:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 12:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In addition, these modes of excitation appear to be\nsensitive to the uncertain density dependence of the symmetry energy. We study\nthe emergence, evolution, and nature of both the soft and giant isoscalar\nmonopole modes as a function of neutron excess in three unstable Nickel\nisotopes: 56Ni, 68Ni, and 78Ni. The distribution of isoscalar monopole strength\nis computed in a relativistic random-phase approximation using several\naccurately calibrated effective interactions. In particular, a non-spectral\nGreen's function approach is adopted that allows for an exact treatment of the\ncontinuum without any reliance on discretization. The discretization of the\ncontinuum is neither required nor admitted. In the case of 56Ni, the lack of\nlow-energy strength results in a direct correlation between the centroid energy\nof the giant monopole resonance and the incompressibility coefficient of\nsymmetric nuclear matter. In contrast, the large neutron excess in both 68Ni\nand 78Ni generates a significant, yet relatively featureless, amount of\nlow-energy strength that is driven by transitions into the continuum. Moreover,\nthe evolution of monopole strength with neutron excess displays sensitivity to\nthe density dependence of the symmetry energy. Our results suggest that future\nmeasurements of the distribution of isoscalar monopole strength at radioactive\nbeam facilities using a very long chain of both stable and unstable isotopes\ncould place important constraints on the equation of state of neutron-rich\nmatter and ultimately on the properties of neutron stars.

Inspired by this ratio estimator and as a first main\ncontribution, this paper proposes a complete theory of such sample singular\nvalues for both the factor part and the noise part under the large-dimensional\nscheme where the dimension and the sample size proportionally grow to infinity.\nIn particular, we provide the exact description of the phase transition\nphenomenon that determines whether a factor is strong enough to be detected\nwith the observed sample singular values. Based on these findings and as a\nsecond main contribution of the paper, we propose a new estimator of the number\nof factors which is strongly consistent for the detection of all significant\nfactors (which are the only theoretically detectable ones). In particular,\nfactors are assumed to have the minimum strength above the phase transition\nboundary which is of the order of a constant; they are thus not required to\ngrow to infinity together with the dimension (as assumed in most of the\nexisting papers on high-dimensional factor models). Empirical Monte-Carlo study\nas well as the analysis of stock returns data attest a very good performance of\nthe proposed estimator.

Unlike previous proposals, it is constructed entirely from\nloss-detecting gates and offers a robustness to photon loss. Even without the\nuse of an active loss-tolerant encoding, our scheme naturally tolerates a total\nloss rate of $\\sim 1.6\\%$ in the photons detected in the gates. This scheme\nuses only 3-GHZ states as a resource, together with a passive linear-optical\nnetwork.

Our results show that the Halley map with fixed\nparameters gives a reliable description of comet dynamics on time scales of\n$10^4$ yr while on a larger scales the parameters of the map are slowly\nchanging due to slow oscillations of orbital momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 15:21:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 17:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-17"}

We first develop a detailed\nlink-level analysis based on OFDM, based on which we propose a tractable\nsystem-level signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) model for\nasynchronous OFDM networks. The proposed model is used to analytically\ncharacterize several important statistics in asynchronous networks with\nspatially distributed transmitters, including (i) the number of decodable\ntransmitters, (ii) the decoding probability of the nearest transmitter, and\n(iii) the system throughput. The system-level loss from lack of synchronization\nis quantified, and to mitigate the loss, we compare and discuss four possible\nsolutions including extended cyclic prefix, advanced receiver timing, dynamic\nreceiver timing positioning, and semi-static receiver timing positioning with\nmultiple timing hypotheses. The model and results are general, and apply to ad\nhoc networks, cellular systems, and neighbor discovery in device-to-device\n(D2D) networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 15:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

This paper introduces an operator R that extracts\na set of 2^{N-1} element Boolean lattices from a 2^N element Boolean lattice.\nUsed recursively, a sequence of Boolean lattices with decreasing order is\ngenerated---a structure that is similar to an MRA. A second operator, which is\na special case of a \"difference operator\", is introduced that operates on\nconsecutive Boolean lattices L_2^n and L_2^{n-1} to produce a sequence of\northocomplemented lattices. These two sequences, together with the subset\nordering relation, form a primorial lattice P. A logic or probability\nconstructed on a Boolean lattice L_2^N likewise induces a primorial lattice P.\nSuch a logic or probability can then be rendered at N different \"resolutions\"\nby selecting any one of the N Boolean lattices in P and at N different\n\"frequencies\" by selecting any of the N different orthocomplemented lattices in\nP. Furthermore, P can be used for symbolic sequence analysis by projecting\nsequences of symbols onto the sublattices in P using one of three lattice\nprojectors introduced. P can be used for symbolic sequence processing by\njudicious rejection and selection of projected sequences. Examples of symbolic\nsequences include sequences of logic values, sequences of probabilistic events,\nand genomic sequences (as used in \"genomic signal processing\").\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 21:17:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-20"}

The performance of WSNs depends on the topology of sensors and their\nability to adapt to changes in the network. Sensor nodes are often resource\nconstrained by their limited power, less communication distance capacity, and\nrestricted sensing capability. Therefore, they need to cooperate with each\nother to accomplish a specific task. Thus, clustering enables sensor nodes to\ncommunicate through the cluster head node for continuous communication process.\nIn this paper, we introduce a dynamic cluster head election mechanism. Each\nnode in the cluster calculates its residual energy value to determine its\ncandidacy to become the Cluster Head Node (CHN). With this mechanism, each\nsensor node compares its residual energy level to other nodes in the same\ncluster. Depending on the residual energy level the sensor node acts as the\nnext cluster head. Evaluation of the dynamic CHN election mechanism is\nconducted using network simulator-2 (ns2).
