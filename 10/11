Exploring the distribution of different molecular species allows us to\nunderstand the physical processes affecting the ISM both in the AGN vicinity as\nwell as in the outer star forming molecular ring. We carried out 3 mm ALMA\nobservations of HCN, HCO+, CCH, CS, HNCO, SiO, HC3N, and SO as well as the 13C\nisotopologues. All species were imaged over the central 2 kpc (~30\") of the\ngalaxy at a resolution of ~2.2\"x1.5 (150 pc x 100 pc). HCO+ and CS appear to be\nslightly enhanced in the star forming ring. CCH, showing the largest variations\nacross NGC 1097, is suggested to be a good tracer of both obscured and early\nstage star formation. HNCO, SiO and HC3N are significantly enhanced in the\ninner circumnuclear disk surrounding the AGN. Differences in the molecular\nabundances are observed between the star forming ring and the inner\ncircumnuclear disk. We conclude that the HCN/HCO+ and HCN/CS differences\nobserved between AGN dominated and starburst galaxies are not due to a HCN\nenhancement due to X-rays, but rather this enhancement is produced by shocked\nmaterial at distances of 200 pc from the AGN. Additionally we claim the lower\nHCN/CS to be a combination of a small under-abundance of CS in AGNs together\nwith excitation effects, where a high dense gas component (~10^6 cm^-3) may be\nmore prominent in SB galaxies. However the most promising are the differences\nfound among the dense gas tracers which, at our modest spatial resolution, seem\nto outline the physical structure of the molecular disk around the AGN. In this\npicture, HNCO probes the well shielded gas in the disk, surrounding the dense\nmaterial moderately exposed to X-ray radiation traced by HC3N. Finally SiO\nmight be the innermost molecule in the disk structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 16:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

In the case of GEC with erasure\nprobability at least 1/2, the upper and lower bounds match and therefore the OT\ncapacity was determined. It was later proved by Pinto et al. (\\emph{IEEE Trans.\nInf. Theory 57(8)}) that in this case there is also a protocol against\nmalicious adversaries achieving the same lower bound, and hence the OT capacity\nis identical for passive and malicious adversaries. In the case of GEC with\nerasure probability smaller than 1/2, the known lower bound against passive\nadversaries that was established by Ahlswede and Csisz\\'{a}r does not match\ntheir upper bound and it was unknown whether this OT rate could be achieved\nagainst malicious adversaries as well. In this work we show that there is a\nprotocol against malicious adversaries achieving the same OT rate that was\nobtained against passive adversaries.\n  In order to obtain our results we introduce a novel use of interactive\nhashing that is suitable for dealing with the case of low erasure probability\n($p^* <1/2$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 18:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

We present our constraints\non the dark matter distribution of this unusual system using Subaru and CFHT\nimaging data. Measuring a high S/N lensing signal from this cluster is\npotentially a challenging task because of its proximity to the Milky Way plane\n(|b|~5 deg).

By suppressing ferroelectricity\nwith bromine substitution on the chlorine sites, pure single crystals were\ntuned through a ferroelectric quantum phase transition. The resulting quantum\ncritical regime was investigated in detail - the first time for a uniaxial\nferroelectric and for an organic ferroelectric - and was found to persist up to\ntemperatures of at least 30K to 40K. The nature of long-range dipole\ninteractions in uniaxial materials, which lead to non-analytical terms in the\nfree-energy expansion in the polarization, predict a dielectric susceptibility\nvarying as $1/T^3$ close to the quantum critical point.

We develop an\naccurate and general solvation model that includes a cavity that is a nonlocal\nfunctional of both solute electron density and potential, local dielectric\nresponse on this nonlocally-determined cavity, and nonlocal approximations to\nthe cavity-formation and dispersion energies. The dependence of the cavity on\nthe solute potential enables an explicit treatment of the solvent charge\nasymmetry. With only three parameters per solvent, this `CANDLE' model\nsimultaneously reproduces solvation energies of large datasets of neutral\nmolecules, cations and anions with a mean absolute error of 1.8 kcal/mol in\nwater and 3.0 kcal/mol in acetonitrile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 22:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-12"}

In this\nwork, we theoretically analyze the energy conversion performance of a\nthermophotovoltaic (TPV) cell made of In0.2Ga0.8Sb when paired with a HMM\nemitter composed of tungsten nanowire arrays embedded in Al2O3 host at\nnanometer vacuum gaps. Fluctuational electrodynamics integrated with effective\nmedium theory and anisotropic thin-film optics is used to calculate the\nnear-field radiative heat transfer. It is found that the spectral radiative\nenergy is enhanced by the epsilon-near-zero and hyperbolic modes at different\npolarizations. As a result, the power output from a semi-infinite TPV cell is\nimproved by 1.85 times with the nanowire HMM emitter over that with a plain\ntungsten emitter at a vacuum gap of 10 nm. Moreover, by using a thin TPV cell\nwith 10 um thickness, the conversion efficiency can be greatly improved from\n19.5% to 31.5% without affecting the power generation, due to the total\ninternal reflection occurring at the bottom cell interface that minimizes the\nsub-bandgap spectral radiative energy. Furthermore, the effects of a TPV cell\nand a nanowire emitter with finite thicknesses are also studied. The result\nshows that the maximum efficiency of 32.2% is achieved with an optimal cell\nthickness of 3 um while the nanowire HMM emitter should be thick enough to be\nopaque.

This limitation induces the motivation to\nresearch on the possibility of directly processing of compressed images. In\nthis research paper, we summarize the research work carried out to perform\ndifferent operations straight from run-length compressed documents without\ngoing through the stage of decompression. The different operations demonstrated\nare feature extraction; text-line, word and character segmentation; document\nblock segmentation; and font size detection, all carried out in the compressed\nversion of the document. Feature extraction methods demonstrate how to extract\nthe conventionally defined features such as projection profile, run-histogram\nand entropy, directly from the compressed document data. Document segmentation\ninvolves the extraction of compressed segments of text-lines, words and\ncharacters using the vertical and horizontal projection profile features.\nFurther an attempt is made to segment randomly a block of interest from the\ncompressed document and subsequently facilitate absolute and relative\ncharacterization of the segmented block which finds real time applications in\nautomatic processing of Bank Cheques, Challans, etc, in compressed domain.\nFinally an application to detect font size at text line level is also\ninvestigated.

Such populations establish themselves with a\nprobability wellknown from branching process theory. Once established, they\ngrow up to a band around the carrying capacity in a time that is logarithmic in\nthe latter, assumed large. There they prevail during a time period whose\nduration is exponential in the carrying capacity. Even populations whose life\nstyle is sustainble in the sense that the habitat carrying capacity is not\neroded but remains the same, ultimately enter an extinction phase, which again\nlasts for a time logarithmic in the carrying capacity.

Observing the\nresponse of the BLR clouds to continuum variations, Reverberation Mapping (RM)\nprovides size vs luminosity and mass vs luminosity relations for QSOs and Sy1\nAGNs with the goal to use these objects as standard candles and mass tags.\nHowever, the RM size can receive different interpretations depending on the\nassumed geometry and the corresponding mass depends on an unknown geometrical\nfactor as well on the possible confusion between local and global velocity\ndispersion.

MRR/MOR renders a new class of energy conversion or storage systems\nwith a very high energy density enabling electric vehicles run much more miles\nat one charge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Oct 2014 02:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-17"}

State-of-the-art routing protocols tried to address these\nspecific problems especially in city environments (vehicles constrained by road\ngeometry, signal transmissions blocked by obstacles, degree of congestion in\nroads etc). It was noticed that in city scenarios codirectional roads consist\nof a collection of disconnected clusters because of traffic control strategies\n(e.g., RSU (Road Side Units), stop signs and traffic lights). In this paper, we\npropose an intervehicle ad-hoc routing metric called EFD (Expected Forwarding\nDelay) based on the vehicular traffic statistics (e.g., densities and\nvelocities) collected on-the-fly. We derive an analytical expression for the\nexpected size of a cluster in co-directional traffic. In case of disconnection\nbetween two co-directional clusters the opposite directional clusters are used\nas a bridge to propagate a message in the actual forwarding direction to reduce\nthe delay due to carry and forward. Through theoretical analysis and extensive\nsimulation, it is shown that our link delay model provides the accurate link\ndelay estimation in bidirectional city environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 21:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-12"}

Separate controllers have been\ndesigned for each subsystem. The gains of the controllers are such chosen that\nthe overall system becomes singularly perturbed system. Then sliding mode\ncontrollers are designed on the singularly perturbed system to drive the\nsubsystems on sliding surfaces in finite time. Negative gradient of a potential\nbased function has been added to the sliding surface to ensure collision\navoidance among the robots in finite time.
