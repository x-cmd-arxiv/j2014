We prove that the distribution function can be derived from\nany isotropic momentum moment and that every higher-order moment of the\ndistribution can be written as an integral over a zeroth-order moment.\n  We propose a mathematically simple expression for the distribution function\nof a family of isotropic general relativistic cluster models and investigate\ntheir dynamical properties. In the Newtonian limit, these models obtain a\ndistribution function of the form F(E) ~ (E-E_0)^alpha, with E binding energy\nand E_0 a constant that determines the model's outer radius. The slope alpha\nsets the steepness of the distribution function and the corresponding radial\ndensity and pressure profiles. We show that the field equations only yield\nsolutions with finite mass for alpha<3.5. Moreover, in the limit alpha->3.5,\nonly Newtonian models exist. In other words: within the context of this family\nof models, no general relativistic version of the Plummer model exists. The\nmost strongly bound model within the family is characterized by alpha=2.75 and\na central redshift z_c~0.55.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 16:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We formulate a set of equations to describe the heating processes\nobserved in the simulation and show that the core-halo temperature ratio of the\nsolar wind is insensitive to the initial conditions in the corona and is\nrelated to the core-halo density ratio of the solar wind and to the\nquasi-saturation property of the two-stream instability at the time when the\nexponential decay ends. This relation can be extended to the more general\ncore-halo-strahl feature in the solar wind. The temperature ratio between the\ncore and hot components is nearly independent of the heliospheric distance to\nthe sun.

Examples include the\nsynchronization of business cycles, population collapse in patchy ecosystems,\nmarkets shifting to a new technology platform, collapses in prices and in\nconfidence in financial markets, and protests erupting in multiple countries. A\nnumber of mathematical models of these phenomena have multiple equilibria\nseparated by saddle-node bifurcations. We study this behavior in its normal\nform as fast--slow ordinary differential equations. In our model, a system\nconsists of multiple subsystems, such as countries in the global economy or\npatches of an ecosystem. Each subsystem is described by a scalar quantity, such\nas economic output or population, that undergoes sudden changes via saddle-node\nbifurcations. The subsystems are coupled via their scalar quantity (e.g., trade\ncouples economic output; diffusion couples populations); that coupling moves\nthe locations of their bifurcations. The model demonstrates two ways in which\nsudden changes can propagate: they can cascade (one causing the next), or they\ncan hop over subsystems. The latter is absent from classic models of cascades.\nFor an application, we study the Arab Spring protests. After connecting the\nmodel to sociological theories that have bistability, we use socioeconomic data\nto estimate relative proximities to tipping points and Facebook data to\nestimate couplings among countries. We find that although protests tend to\nspread locally, they also seem to \"hop\" over countries, like in the stylized\nmodel; this result highlights a new class of temporal motifs in longitudinal\nnetwork datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 19:20:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 16:03:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 17:26:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2015 16:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-12"}

In this\npaper, we present and discuss the results of a detailed and systematic study on\n6 black-box web scanners (both proprietary and open source) that we conducted\nin coordination with the respective vendors.

In this paper, we propose a novel Two-Layer Feature REduction\nmethod (TLFre) for SGL via a decomposition of its dual feasible set. The\ntwo-layer reduction is able to quickly identify the inactive groups and the\ninactive features, respectively, which are guaranteed to be absent from the\nsparse representation and can be removed from the optimization. Existing\nfeature reduction methods are only applicable for sparse models with one\nsparsity-inducing regularizer.

Our analysis shows\nthat formal numerical convergence is possible in SPH only in the joint limit $N\n\\rightarrow \\infty$, $h \\rightarrow 0$, and $N_{nb} \\rightarrow \\infty$, where\n$N$ is the total number of particles, $h$ is the smoothing length, and $N_{nb}$\nis the number of neighbor particles within the smoothing volume used to compute\nsmoothed estimates. Previous work has generally assumed that the conditions $N\n\\rightarrow \\infty$ and $h \\rightarrow 0$ are sufficient to achieve\nconvergence, while holding $N_{nb}$ fixed. We demonstrate that if $N_{nb}$ is\nheld fixed as the resolution is increased, there will be a residual source of\nerror that does not vanish as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $h \\rightarrow 0$.\nFormal numerical convergence in SPH is possible only if $N_{nb}$ is increased\nsystematically as the resolution is improved. Using analytic arguments, we\nderive an optimal compromise scaling for $N_{nb}$ by requiring that this source\nof error balance that present in the smoothing procedure. For typical choices\nof the smoothing kernel, we find $N_{nb} \\propto N^{1/2}$.

However, polynomial time algorithms are only\nknown to correct a much smaller fraction of errors. One of the most powerful\npolynomial-time algorithms with a formal analysis is the LP decoding algorithm\nof Feldman et al. which is known to correct an Omega(1/dc) fraction of errors.\nIn this work, we show that fairly powerful extensions of LP decoding, based on\nthe Sherali-Adams and Lasserre hierarchies, fail to correct much more errors\nthan the basic LP-decoder. In particular, we show that:\n  1) For any values of dv and dc, a linear number of rounds of the\nSherali-Adams LP hierarchy cannot correct more than an O(1/dc) fraction of\nerrors on a random (dv,dc)-regular LDPC code.\n  2) For any value of dv and infinitely many values of dc, a linear number of\nrounds of the Lasserre SDP hierarchy cannot correct more than an O(1/dc)\nfraction of errors on a random (dv,dc)-regular LDPC code.\n  Our proofs use a new stretching and collapsing technique that allows us to\nleverage recent progress in the study of the limitations of LP/SDP hierarchies\nfor Maximum Constraint Satisfaction Problems (Max-CSPs). The problem then\nreduces to the construction of special balanced pairwise independent\ndistributions for Sherali-Adams and special cosets of balanced pairwise\nindependent subgroups for Lasserre.\n  Some of our techniques are more generally applicable to a large class of\nBoolean CSPs called Min-Ones. In particular, for k-Hypergraph Vertex Cover, we\nobtain an improved integrality gap of $k-1-\\epsilon$ that holds after a\n\\emph{linear} number of rounds of the Lasserre hierarchy, for any k = q+1 with\nq an arbitrary prime power. The best previous gap for a linear number of rounds\nwas equal to $2-\\epsilon$ and due to Schoenebeck.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 21:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-17"}

With observational data, there may be\nimbalances in confounding variables between the two groups. One approach to\naccount for such imbalances is to estimate a covariate-adjusted restricted mean\ndifference by modeling the covariate-adjusted survival distribution and then\nmarginalizing over the covariate distribution. We demonstrate that the\nmean-squared error of the restricted mean difference is bounded by the\nmean-squared error of the covariate-adjusted survival distribution estimators.\nThis implies that a better estimator of the covariate-adjusted survival\ndistributions is associated with a better estimator of the restricted mean\ndifference. Thus, this paper proposes estimating restricted mean differences\nwith stacked survival models. Stacked survival models estimate a weighted\naverage of several survival models by minimizing predicted error. By including\na range of parametric and semi-parametric models, stacked survival models can\neffectively estimate a covariate-adjusted survival distribution and, therefore,\nthe restricted mean treatment effect in a wide range of scenarios. We\ndemonstrate through a simulation study that the new estimator can perform\nnearly as well as Cox regression when the proportional hazards assumption is\nsatisfied and significantly better when proportional hazards is violated.

We demonstrate the\naccuracy of our method through a variety of benchmark tests including the\nirradiation of a static disk, subcritical and supercritical radiative shocks,\nand thermal energy equilibration. We also demonstrate the capability of our\nmethod for casting shadows and calculating gas and dust temperatures in the\npresence of multiple stellar sources. Our method enables radiation-hydrodynamic\nstudies of young stellar objects, protostellar disks, and clustered star\nformation in magnetized, filamentary environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 23:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In particular, the Lyman-alpha emission line at 1216 Angstroms,\nwhich dominates the far-ultraviolet spectrum, is a major source of\nphotodissociation of important atmospheric molecules such as water and methane.\nThe intrinsic flux of Lyman-alpha, however, cannot be directly measured due to\nthe absorption of neutral hydrogen in the interstellar medium and contamination\nby geocoronal emission. To date, reconstruction of the intrinsic Lyman-alpha\nline based on Hubble Space Telescope spectra has been accomplished for 46 FGKM\nnearby stars, 28 of which have also been observed by the Galaxy Evolution\nExplorer (GALEX). Our investigation provides a correlation between published\nintrinsic Lyman-alpha and GALEX far- and near-ultraviolet chromospheric fluxes\nfor K and M stars. The negative correlations between the ratio of the\nLyman-alpha to the GALEX fluxes reveal how the relative strength of Lyman-alpha\ncompared to the broadband fluxes weakens as the FUV and NUV excess flux\nincrease. We also correlate GALEX fluxes with the strong near-ultraviolet Mg II\nh+k spectral emission lines formed at lower chromospheric temperatures than\nLyman-alpha. The reported correlations provide estimates of intrinsic\nLyman-alpha and Mg II fluxes for the thousands of K and M stars in the archived\nGALEX all-sky surveys. These will constrain new stellar upper-atmosphere models\nfor cool stars and provide realistic inputs to models describing exoplanetary\nphotochemistry and atmospheric evolution in the absence of ultraviolet\nspectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 00:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

One of the novel\nfeatures discussed in relation to 5G is Ultra-Reliable Communication (URC), an\noperation mode not present in today's wireless systems. URC refers to provision\nof certain level of communication service almost 100 % of the time. Example URC\napplications include reliable cloud connectivity, critical connections for\nindustrial automation and reliable wireless coordination among vehicles. This\npaper puts forward a systematic view on URC in 5G wireless systems. It starts\nby analyzing the fundamental mechanisms that constitute a wireless connection\nand concludes that one of the key steps towards enabling URC is revision of the\nmethods for encoding control information (metadata) and data. It introduces the\nkey concept of Reliable Service Composition, where a service is designed to\nadapt its requirements to the level of reliability that can be attained. The\nproblem of URC is analyzed across two different dimensions. The first dimension\nis the type of URC problem that is defined based on the time frame used to\nmeasure the reliability of the packet transmission. Two types of URC problems\nare identified: long-term URC (URC-L) and short-term URC (URC-S). The second\ndimension is represented by the type of reliability impairment that can affect\nthe communication reliability in a given scenario. The main objective of this\npaper is to create the context for defining and solving the new engineering\nproblems posed by URC in 5G.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 08:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-17"}

Gas,\ndriven to the centre by a bar, settles into a rotating star-forming nuclear\ndisc (ND). This ND is thinner, younger, kinematically cooler, and more\nmetal-rich than the surrounding bar. The ND is elliptical and orthogonal to the\nbar. The complex kinematics in the region of the ND are a result of the\nsuperposition of older stars streaming along the bar and younger stars\ncirculating within the ND. The signature of the ND is therefore subtle in the\nkinematics. Instead the ND stands out clearly in metallicity and age maps.

A drawback of this dynamic language, however, is its low\nruntime performance which limits its applicability for large simulations and\nfor the analysis of large data sets, as is common in astrophysics and\ncosmology. While various frameworks have been developed to address this\nlimitation, most focus on covering the complete language set, and either force\nthe user to alter the code or are not able to reach the full speed of an\noptimised native compiled language. In order to combine the ease of Python and\nthe speed of C++, we developed HOPE, a specialised Python just-in-time (JIT)\ncompiler designed for numerical astrophysical applications. HOPE focuses on a\nsubset of the language and is able to translate Python code into C++ while\nperforming numerical optimisation on mathematical expressions at runtime. To\nenable the JIT compilation, the user only needs to add a decorator to the\nfunction definition. We assess the performance of HOPE by performing a series\nof benchmarks and compare its execution speed with that of plain Python, C++\nand the other existing frameworks. We find that HOPE improves the performance\ncompared to plain Python by a factor of 2 to 120, achieves speeds comparable to\nthat of C++, and often exceeds the speed of the existing solutions. We discuss\nthe differences between HOPE and the other frameworks, as well as future\nextensions of its capabilities.

We introduce a generalization of\nthe BTER model of Seshadhri et al. by adding flexibility to community\nstructure, and use this model to perform multi-scale graph anomaly detection.\nSpecifically, probability models describing coarse subgraphs are built by\naggregating probabilities at finer levels, and these closely related\nhierarchical models simultaneously detect deviations from expectation. This\ntechnique provides insight into a graph's structure and internal context that\nmay shed light on a detected event. Additionally, this multi-scale analysis\nfacilitates intuitive visualizations by allowing users to narrow focus from an\nanomalous graph to particular subgraphs or nodes causing the anomaly.\n  For evaluation, two hierarchical anomaly detectors are tested against a\nbaseline Gaussian method on a series of sampled graphs. We demonstrate that our\ngraph statistics-based approach outperforms both a distribution-based detector\nand the baseline in a labeled setting with community structure, and it\naccurately detects anomalies in synthetic and real-world datasets at the node,\nsubgraph, and graph levels.

We present a\ndetailed spectroscopic analysis of the pulsating star RR Lyr, the prototype of\nits class, over a complete pulsation cycle, based on high-resolution spectra\ncollected at the 2.7-m telescope of McDonald Observatory. We used simultaneous\nphotometry to determine the accurate pulsation phase of each spectrum and\ndetermined the effective temperature, the shape of the depth-dependent\nmicroturbulent velocity, and the abundance of several elements, for each phase.\nThe surface gravity was fixed to 2.4. Element abundances resulting from our\nanalysis are stable over the pulsation cycle. However, a variation in\nionisation equilibrium is observed around minimum radius. We attribute this\nmostly to a dynamical acceleration contributing to the surface gravity.\nVariable turbulent convection on time scales longer than the pulsation cycle\nhas been proposed as a cause for the Blazhko effect. We test this hypothesis to\nsome extent by using the derived variable depth-dependent microturbulent\nvelocity profiles to estimate their effect on the stellar magnitude. These\neffects turn out to be wavelength-dependent and much smaller than the observed\nlight variations over the Blazhko cycle: if variations in the turbulent motions\nare entirely responsible for the Blazhko effect, they must surpass the scales\ncovered by the microturbulent velocity. This work demonstrates the possibility\nof a self-consistent spectroscopic analysis over an entire pulsation cycle\nusing static atmosphere models, provided one takes into account certain\nfeatures of a rapidly pulsating atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 11:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

It is argued that\nevaluation of such procedures is best addressed from the point of view of\nprobability forecasting or Dawid's theory of `prequential statistics' [Dawid,\nJRSS(A)1984]. We introduce a concept of `calibration' of a risk measure in a\ndynamic setting, following the precepts of Dawid's weak and strong prequential\nprinciples, and examine its application to quantile forecasting (VaR -- value\nat risk) and to mean estimation (applicable to CVaR -- expected shortfall). The\nrelationship between these ideas and `elicitability' [Gneiting, JASA 2011] is\nexamined. We show in particular that VaR has special properties not shared by\nany other risk measure. Turning to CVaR we argue that its main deficiency is\nthe unquantifiable tail dependence of estimators.

We\nextend this study to analyse the effect of these ionisation profiles on\nvelocity structures, kinematics, and synthetic spectra. Clump regions are found\nto occur at the convergence of two flows with a low velocity region and\nvelocity direction transition occurring at the junction. Models with evident\nsubstructure show that core formation occurs on the periphery of these velocity\nvalleys. Analysis of synthetic spectra reveals the presence of large\nnon-thermal components within low-density gas, especially for models with the\nstep-like ionisation profile. All cores show small, sub-thermal relative\nmotions compared to background gas. Large deviations within this analysis are\ndue to the line of sight intersecting low- and high-density regions across the\nvelocity switch transition. Positive deviations correspond to a foreground core\nmoving away from the observer while negative deviations correspond to a\nbackground core moving toward the observer. Comparison of velocities resulting\nfrom different ionisation profiles suggest that high ionisation fractions yield\nsupersonic velocities, up to two times the sound speed, while regions with low\nionisation fractions tend to be subsonic or mildly supersonic. This suggests\nthat the transition to coherence within cores could be a transition between\nhigh and low ionisation fractions within the gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 13:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

We find that artificial networks matching connectivity\nproperties of the English PN are exceedingly rare: this leads to the hypothesis\nthat the word repertoire might have been assembled over time by preferentially\nintroducing new words which are small modifications of old words. Our null\nmodels are able to explain the \"power-law-like\" part of the degree\ndistributions and generally retrieve qualitative features of the PN such as\nhigh clustering, high assortativity coefficient, and small-world\ncharacteristics. However, the detailed comparison to expectations from null\nmodels also points out significant differences, suggesting the presence of\nadditional constraints in word assembly. Key constraints we identify are the\navoidance of large degrees, the avoidance of triadic closure, and the avoidance\nof large non-percolating clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 14:25:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 17:34:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 10:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

Such\ninadvertent gaps are usually smoothed over using interpolation techniques.\nHowever the smoothing techniques can introduce artificial effects, especially\nwhen non-linear analysis is undertaken. We investigate how gaps can affect the\ncomputed values of correlation dimension of the system, without using any\ninterpolation. For this we introduce gaps artificially in synthetic data\nderived from standard chaotic systems, like the R{\\\"o}ssler and Lorenz, with\nfrequency of occurrence and size of missing data drawn from two Gaussian\ndistributions. Then we study the changes in correlation dimension with change\nin the distributions of position and size of gaps. We find that for a\nconsiderable range of mean gap frequency and size, the value of correlation\ndimension is not significantly affected, indicating that in such specific\ncases, the calculated values can still be reliable and acceptable. Thus our\nstudy introduces a method of checking the reliability of computed correlation\ndimension values by calculating the distribution of gaps with respect to its\nsize and position. This is illustrated for the data from light curves of three\nvariable stars, R Scuti, U Monocerotis and SU Tauri. We also demonstrate how a\ncubic spline interpolation can cause a time series of Gaussian noise with\nmissing data to be misinterpreted as being chaotic in origin. This is\ndemonstrated for the non chaotic light curve of variable star SS Cygni, which\ngives a saturated D$_{2}$ value, when interpolated using a cubic spline. In\naddition we also find that a careful choice of binning, in addition to reducing\nnoise, can help in shifting the gap distribution to the reliable range for\nD$_2$ values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 14:45:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2015 11:38:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2015 06:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-13"}

There is a free parameter in our model which can be\ninterpreted as defining the boundary between the unknown quantum gravity regime\nand the inflation/baryogenesis regime covered by our model. When this parameter\nis adjusted to give the observed value of baryon asymmetry we get a higher than\nusual energy scale for our inflation model which however may be in line with\nthe GUT scale for inflation in view of the BICEP2 and Planck results. In\naddition our model provides the correct temperature for the CMB photons at the\ntime of decoupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 20:08:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 2015 17:13:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-11"}

The\nclosed-form formulas for covariance proposed in previous literature generally\nbuild upon the fact that the solution to ICP is obtained by minimizing a linear\nleast-squares problem. In this paper, we show this approach needs caution\nbecause the rematching step of the algorithm is not explicitly accounted for,\nand applying it to the point-to-point version of ICP leads to completely\nerroneous covariances. We then provide a formal mathematical proof why the\napproach is valid in the point-to-plane version of ICP, which validates the\nintuition and experimental results of practitioners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 00:14:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2015 05:52:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 23:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-18"}

Nevertheless, its hygroscopic\ncharacter basically affects all related mechanical properties leading to\ndegradation of material stiffness and strength over the service life.\nAccordingly, to attain reliable design of the timber structures, the influence\nof moisture evolution and the role of time- and moisture-dependent behaviors\nhave to be taken into account. For this purpose, in the current study a 3D\northotropic elasto-plastic, visco-elastic, mechano-sorptive constitutive model\nfor wood, with all material constants being defined as a function of moisture\ncontent, is presented. The corresponding numerical integration approach, with\nadditive decomposition of the total strain is developed and implemented within\nthe framework of the finite element method (FEM). Moreover to preserve a\nquadratic rate of asymptotic convergence the consistent tangent operator for\nthe whole model is derived.\n  Functionality and capability of the presented material model are evaluated by\nperforming several numerical verification simulations of wood components under\ndifferent combinations of mechanical loading and moisture variation.\nAdditionally, the flexibility and universality of the introduced model to\npredict the mechanical behavior of different species are demonstrated by the\nanalysis of a hybrid wood element. Furthermore, the proposed numerical approach\nis validated by comparisons of computational evaluations with experimental\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 18:24:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-06"}
