We model CNTs as discrete elastic structures, whose shape and\nvolume changes are governed by a Reactive Empirical Bond-Order interatomic\npotential of second generation. The kinematical variables we consider are bond\nlengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles; to changes of each of these\nvariables we associate a work-conjugate nanostress. To determine the\nself-stress state in a given CNT, we formulate the load-free equilibrium\nproblem as a minimum problem for the interatomic potential, whose solution\nyields the equilibrium nanostresses; next, by exploiting the nonlinear\nconstitutive dependence we derive for nanostresses in terms of a list of\nkinematical variables, we determine the equilibrium values of the latter;\nfinally, from the equilibrium values of the kinematical variables we deduce the\nnatural geometry and, in particular, the natural radius.

Given the low frequency observations\n$(X_t)_{t=1,\\ldots,n}$, the dependence structure of the jumps of $X$ is\nestimated. The L\\'evy measure $\\nu$ describes the average jump behavior in a\ntime unit. Thus, the aim is to estimate the dependence structure of $\\nu$ by\nestimating the L\\'evy copula $\\mathfrak{C}$ of $\\nu$, cf. Kallsen and Tankov\n\\cite{KalTan}.\n  We use the low frequency techniques presented in a one dimensional setting in\nNeumann and Rei{\\ss} \\cite{NeuRei} and Nickl and Rei{\\ss} \\cite{NicRei} to\nconstruct a L\\'evy copula estimator $\\widehat{\\mathfrak{C}}_n$ based on the\nabove $n$ observations. In doing so we prove $$\\widehat{\\mathfrak{C}}_n\\to\n\\mathfrak{C},\\quad n\\to\\infty$$ uniformly on compact sets bounded away from\nzero with the convergence rate $\\sqrt{\\log n}$. This convergence holds under\nquite general assumptions, which also include L\\'evy triplets with $\\Sigma\\neq\n0$ and $\\nu$ of arbitrary Blumenthal-Getoor index $0\\leq\\beta\\leq 2$. Note that\nin a low frequency observation scheme, it is statistically difficult to\ndistinguish between infinitely many small jumps and a Brownian motion part.\nHence, the rather slow convergence rate $\\sqrt{\\log n}$ is not surprising.\n  In the complementary case of a compound Poisson process (CPP), an estimator\n$\\widehat{C}_n$ for the copula $C$ of the jump distribution of the CPP is\nconstructed under the same observation scheme. This copula $C$ is the analogue\nto the L\\'evy copula $\\mathfrak{C}$ in the finite jump activity case, i.e. the\nCPP case. Here we establish $$\\widehat{C}_n \\to C,\\quad n\\to\\infty$$ with the\nconvergence rate $\\sqrt{n}$ uniformly on compact sets bounded away from zero.\n  Both convergence rates are optimal in the sense of Neumann and Rei{\\ss}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 16:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

In this, the first of several\nplanned papers on program Cepheids, we report the current results for delta\nCep, the Cepheid prototype. Ongoing photometry has been obtained to search for\nchanges in the pulsation period, light curve morphology and amplitude.\nCombining our photometry with the times of maximum light compilation by\nBerdnikov 2000 returns a small period change of dP/dt ~ -0.1006 +/- 0.0002 sec\nyr^-1. There is also evidence for a gradual light amplitude increase of\n~0.011-mag (V-band) and ~0.012-mag (B-band) per decade over the last ~50 years.\nIn addition, HST-COS UV spectrophotometry and XMM-Newton X-ray data were\ncarried out to investigate the high-temperature plasmas present above the\nCepheid photospheres. In total, from the five visits (eight exposures) with\nXMM-Newton, delta Cep is found to be a soft X-ray source (Lx [0.3--2 keV] ~\n4.5-13x10^28 erg sec^-1) with peak flux at kT = 0.6-0.9 keV. The X-ray activity\nis found to vary, possibly in phase with the stellar pulsations. From\n2010-2013, nine observations of delta Cep were carried out with HST-COS. The UV\nemissions are also variable, and well-phased with the stellar pulsations.\nMaximum UV line emissions occur near, or slightly before, maximum optical\nlight, varying by as much as twenty times. This variability shows that\npulsation-induced shock-heating plays a significant role in Cepheid\natmospheres, possibly in addition to a quiescent, magnetic heating. The results\nof this study show Cepheid atmospheres to be rather complex and dynamic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 16:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

Furthermore, the scheduler is\nacquainted with channel state information periodically reported by user\nequipments either in an aggregate form for the whole downlink channel, or\ndistinguished for each available subchannel. This mechanism allows for wide\ndiscretion in resource allocation, thus promoting the flourishing of several\nscheduling algorithms, with different purposes. It is therefore of great\ninterest to compare the performance of such algorithms in different scenarios.\nA very common simulation tool that can be used for this purpose is ns-3, which\nalready supports a set of well known scheduling algorithms for LTE downlink,\nthough it still lacks schedulers that provide throughput guarantees. In this\nwork we contribute to fill this gap by implementing a scheduling algorithm that\nprovides long-term throughput guarantees to the different users, while\nopportunistically exploiting the instantaneous channel fluctuations to increase\nthe cell capacity. We then perform a thorough performance analysis of the\ndifferent scheduling algorithms by means of extensive ns-3 simulations, both\nfor saturated UDP and TCP traffic sources. The analysis makes it possible to\nappreciate the difference among the scheduling algorithms, and to assess the\nperformance gain, both in terms of cell capacity and packet service time,\nobtained by allowing the schedulers to work on the frequency domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 17:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

We study the dispersions of the charge and spin\nmodes and their coupling to each other within a generalized Random Phase\nApproximation for arbitrarily strong SOC, and both in 2D and 3D systems. In\nboth 2D and 3D, we find that the charge plasmons are coupled to only one of the\nthree chiral-spin modes. This coupling is shown to affect the dispersions of\nthe modes at finite but not at zero wavenumbers. In 3D, the chiral-spin modes\nare strongly damped by particle-hole excitations and disappear for weak\nelectron-electron interaction. Landau damping of the chiral-spin modes in 3D is\ndirectly related to the fact that, in contrast to 2D, there is no gap for\nparticle-hole excitations between spin-split subbands. The gapless continuum is\nalso responsible for Landau damping of the charge plasmon in 3D - a\nqualitatively new feature of the SOC system.

As a follow up, here we\nused the Hubble Space Telescope to investigate the existence of one of these\ncandidate planets, UCF-1.01, by searching for two transit signals as it passed\nin front of its host star. Interpretation of the data hinges critically on\ncorrectly modeling and removing the WFC3 instrument systematics from the light\ncurves. Building on previous HST work, we demonstrate that WFC3 analyses need\nto explore the use of a quadratic function to fit a visit-long time-dependent\nsystematic. This is important for establishing absolute transit and eclipse\ndepths in the white light curves of all transiting systems. The work presented\nhere exemplifies this point by putatively detecting the primary transit of\nUCF-1.01 with the use of a linear trend. However, using a quadratic trend, we\nachieve a better fit to the white light curves and a reduced transit depth that\nis inconsistent with previous Spitzer measurements. Furthermore, quadratic\ntrends with or without a transit model component produce comparable fits to the\navailable data. Using extant WFC3 transit light curves for GJ436b, we further\nvalidate the quadratic model component by achieving photon-limited model fit\nresiduals and consistent transit depths over multiple epochs.

To quantify the\nmass distributions, we fit power laws of the form $dN/dM \\propto M^{-\\alpha}$.\nOur new, larger sample of M31 progenitors follows a distribution with $\\alpha =\n4.4\\pm 0.4$, and the M33 sample follows a distribution with $\\alpha =\n3.8^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. Thus both samples are consistent within the uncertainties,\nand the full sample across both galaxies gives $\\alpha = 4.2\\pm 0.3$. Both the\nindividual and full distributions display a paucity of massive stars when\ncompared to a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF), which we would expect to\nobserve if all massive stars exploded as SN that leave behind observable SNR.\nIf we instead fix $\\alpha = 2.35$ and treat the maximum mass as a free\nparameter, we find $M_{max} \\sim 35-45M_{sun}$, indicative of a potential\nmaximum cutoff mass for SN production. Our results suggest that either SNR\nsurveys are biased against finding objects in the youngest (<10 Myr old)\nregions, or the highest mass stars do not produce SNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 20:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

X-ray emission from the wind bubble is\nsoft, faint, and comes mainly from the turbulent mixing layer between the wind\nbubble and the H II region. The wind bubble radiates <1 per cent of its energy\nin X-rays; it loses most of its energy by turbulent mixing with cooler\nphotoionized gas.

The\nproperties of galaxies living in voids are compared with those of galaxies\nliving in the void shells and with a control sample, representing the general\ngalaxy population. Void galaxies appear to form stars more efficiently than\nshell galaxies and the control sample. This result can not be interpreted as a\nconsequence of the bias towards low masses in underdense regions, as void\ngalaxy subsamples with the same mass distribution as the control sample also\nshow statistically different specific star formation rates. This highlights the\nfact that galaxy evolution in voids is slower with respect to the evolution of\nthe general population. Nevertheless, when only the star forming galaxies are\nconsidered, we find that the star formation rate is insensitive to the\nenvironment, as the main sequence is remarkably constant in the three samples\nunder consideration. This fact implies that environmental effects manifest\nthemselves as fast quenching mechanisms, while leaving the non-quenched\ngalaxies almost unaffected, as their star formation activity is largely\nregulated by the mass of their halo. We also analyse galaxy properties as a\nfunction of void-centric distance and find that the enhancement in the star\nformation activity with respect to the control sample is observable up to a\nradial distance 1.5 Rvoid. This result can be used as a suitable definition of\nvoid shells. Finally, we find that larger voids show an enhanced star formation\nactivity in the shells with respect to their smaller counterparts, that could\nbe related to the different dynamical evolution experienced by voids of\ndifferent sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 20:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

I provide a comprehensive conceptual discussion of the\nrenormalization of lattice-regularized quantum gravity models. I begin with a\npresentation of the renormalization group from the Wilsonian perspective. I\nthen consider the application of the renormalization group in four contexts:\nquantum field theory on a continuous nondynamical spacetime, quantum field\ntheory on a lattice-regularized nondynamical spacetime, quantum field theory of\ncontinuous dynamical spacetime, and quantum field theory of lattice-regularized\ndynamical spacetime. The first three contexts serve to identify successively\nthe particular issues that arise in the fourth context. These issues originate\nin the inescability of establishing all scales solely on the basis of the\ndynamics.

Restricting the state of each atom to a qutrit embedded in\nthe 2f+1 dimensional hyperfine spin enables us to efficiently model the\ncoherent and dissipative dynamics of the ensemble. This formalism also allows\nus to explore the effects of local control on the internal hyperfine spins of\nthe atoms. State preparation using such control increases the entangling power\nof the atom-light interface for f>1/2. Subsequent control of the internal spins\nconverts entanglement into metrologically relevant spin squeezing. In the case\nof squeezing by quantum nondemolition measurement, we employ a numerical search\nto find state preparations that maximize spin squeezing in the presence of\ndecoherence. Dissipative dynamics on our system include optical pumping due to\nspontaneous emission. While most works ignore optical pumping or treat it\nphenomenologically, we employ a master equation derived from first principles.\nThis work is extended to the case of an atomic ensemble interacting with a\nnon-homogeneous paraxial probe. The geometries of the ensemble and the probe\nare optimized to maximize both spatial mode matching and spin squeezing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 02:08:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-02"}

The clustering problem with these examples of\n$M$ is already useful for numerous application domains such as action\nidentification in video sequences, dynamic texture clustering, brain fiber\nsegmentation in medical imaging, and clustering of deformed images. The\nproposed clustering algorithm constructs a data-affinity matrix by thoroughly\nexploiting the intrinsic geometry and then applies spectral clustering. The\nintrinsic local geometry is encoded by local sparse coding and more importantly\nby directional information of local tangent spaces and geodesics. Theoretical\nguarantees are established for a simplified variant of the algorithm even when\nthe clusters intersect. To avoid complication, these guarantees assume that the\nunderlying submanifolds are geodesic.

These bio-signatures\nextracted from the surveillance sensors can be used to deduce age, ethnicity,\ngender and actions, and further characterize human actions in unseen scenarios.\nHowever, recovery of pose and shape of humans in such monocular videos is\ninherently an ill-posed problem, marked by frequent depth and view based\nambiguities due to self-occlusion, foreshortening and misalignment.

On the other hand, they are\nmassive blobs that can interact gravitationally with the planets in the disc.\nAims: We aim to study how a vortex interacts gravitationally with a planet\nwhich migrates toward it or a planet which is created inside the vortex.\nMethods: We performed hydrodynamical simulations of a viscous locally\nisothermal disc using GFARGO and FARGO-ADSG. We set a stationary Gaussian\npressure bump in the disc in a way that RWI is triggered. After a large vortex\nis established, we implanted a low mass planet in the outer disc or inside the\nvortex and allowed it to migrate. We also examined the effect of vortex\nstrength on the planet migration and checked the validity of the final result\nin the presence of self-gravity. Results: We noticed regardless of the planet's\ninitial position, the planet is finally locked to the vortex or its migration\nis stopped in a farther orbital distance in case of a stronger vortex. For the\nmodel with the weaker vortex, we studied the effect of different parameters\nsuch as background viscosity, background surface density, mass of the planet\nand different planet positions. In these models, while the trapping time and\nlocking angle of the planet vary for different parameters, the main result,\nwhich is the planet-vortex locking, remains valid. We discovered that even a\nplanet with a mass less than 5 * 10^{-7} M_{\\star} comes out from the vortex\nand is locked to it at the same orbital distance. For a stronger vortex, both\nin non-self-gravitated and self-gravitating models, the planet migration is\nstopped far away from the radial position of the vortex. This effect can make\nthe vortices a suitable place for continual planet formation under the\ncondition that they save their shape during the planetary growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 07:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

The eigenmodels\nof the Hessian provide the longitudinal (stretching) and transverse (bending)\neigenmodes of the polymer, and the corresponding eigenvalues match well with\nthe established phenomenology of semiflexible polymers.

From the point of view\nof high energy astrophysics, this instability also plays a crucial role because\nits development in the shock precursor populates the downstream with a\nsmall-scale magneto-static turbulence which shapes the acceleration and\nradiative processes of suprathermal particles. The present work discusses the\nphysics of the dissipation of this Weibel-generated turbulence downstream of\nrelativistic collisionless shock waves. It calculates explicitly the\nfirst-order non-linear terms associated to the diffusive nature of the particle\ntrajectories. These corrections are found to systematically increase the\ndamping rate, assuming that the scattering length remains larger than the\ncoherence length of the magnetic fluctuations.

The\n2D Hubbard model has been adopted as it has been considered the minimal model\ncapable to describe the most peculiar features of cuprates held responsible for\ntheir anomalous behavior. COM is designed to endorse, since its foundations,\nthe systematic emergence in any SCS of new elementary excitations described by\ncomposite operators obeying non-canonical algebras. In this case (underdoped\ncuprates - 2D Hubbard model), the residual interactions - beyond a 2-pole\napproximation - between the new elementary electronic excitations, dictated by\nthe strong local Coulomb repulsion and well described by the two Hubbard\ncomposite operators, have been treated within the Non Crossing Approximation.\nGiven this recipe and exploiting the few unknowns to enforce the Pauli\nprinciple content in the solution, it is possible to qualitatively describe\nsome of the anomalous features of high-Tc cuprate superconductors such as large\nvs. small Fermi surface dichotomy, Fermi surface deconstruction (appearance of\nFermi arcs), nodal vs. anti-nodal physics, pseudogap(s), kinks in the\nelectronic dispersion. The resulting scenario envisages a smooth crossover\nbetween an ordinary weakly-interacting metal sustaining weak, short-range\nantiferromagnetic correlations in the overdoped regime to an unconventional\npoor metal characterized by very strong, long-but-finite-range\nantiferromagnetic correlations leading to momentum-selective non-Fermi liquid\nfeatures as well as to the opening of a pseudogap and to the striking\ndifferences between the nodal and the anti-nodal dynamics in the underdoped\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 09:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

At P\\'eclet numbers Pe >\n1 it behaves as a simple Herschel Bulkley liquid, whereas at Pe < 1 highly\nnon-monotonic flow curves are seen. In controlled stress testing it shows\nhysteresis and shear banding and in the usual type of stress scan, used to\nmeasure flow curves in controlled stress mode routinely, it can show very\nerratic and irreproducible behaviour. All of these features will be attributed\nhere to a dependence of the solid phase, or, yield stress, on the prevailing\nrate of shear at the yield point. Stress growth curves obtained from step\nstrain-rate testing showed that this rate-dependence was a consequence of\nP\\'eclet number dependent strain softening. At very low Pe, yield was\ncooperative and the yield strain was order-one, whereas as Pe approached unity,\nthe yield strain reduced to that needed to break interparticle bonds, causing\nthe yield stress to be greatly reduced. It is suspected that rate-dependent\nyield could well be the rule rather than the exception for cohesive suspensions\nmore generally. If so, then the Herschel-Bulkley equation can usefully be\ngeneralized to read (in simple shear).

Their stability reflects symmetry of micro world and\nmechanisms of its symmetry breaking. In the early Universe heavy metastable\nparticles can dominate, leaving primordial black holes (PBHs) after their\ndecay, as well as the structure of particle symmetry breaking gives rise to\ncosmological phase transitions, from which massive black holes and/or their\nclusters can originate. PBHs can be formed in such transitions within a narrow\ninterval of masses about $10^{17}$g and, avoiding severe observational\nconstraints on PBHs, can be a candidate for the dominant form of dark matter.\nPBHs in this range of mass can give solution of the problem of reionization in\nthe Universe at the redshift $z\\sim 5... 10$. Clusters of massive PBHs can\nserve as a nonlinear seeds for galaxy formation, while PBHs evaporating in such\nclusters can provide an interesting interpretation for the observations of\npoint-like gamma-ray sources. Analysis of possible PBH signatures represents a\nuniversal probe for super-high energy physics in the early Universe in studies\nof indirect effects of the dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 12:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-22"}

However, when\nconsidering habitat modeling in ecology, a natural constraint comes from\nnearest-neighbor correlations between the suitable/unsuitable states of the\nspatial units forming the habitat. Such constraints are also relevant in the\nphysics of aggregation where underlying processes may lead to a form of\ncorrelated percolation. However, in ecology, the processes leading to habitat\ncorrelations are in general not known or very complex. As proposed by Hiebeler\n[Ecology {\\bf 81}, 1629 (2000)], these correlations can be captured in a\nlattice model by an observable aggregation parameter $q$, supplementing the\ndensity $p$ of suitable sites. We investigate this model as an instance of\ncorrelated percolation. We analyze the phase diagram of the percolation\ntransition and compute the cluster size distribution, the pair-connectedness\nfunction $C(r)$ and the correlation function $g(r)$. We find that while $g(r)$\ndisplays a power-law decrease associated with long-range correlations in a wide\ndomain of parameter values, critical properties are compatible with the\nuniversality class of uncorrelated percolation. We contrast the correlation\nstructures obtained respectively for the correlated percolation model and for\nthe Ising model, and show that the diversity of habitat configurations\ngenerated by the Hiebeler model is richer than the archetypal Ising model. We\nalso find that emergent structural properties are peculiar to the implemented\nalgorithm, leading to questioning the notion of a well-defined model of\naggregated habitat. We conclude that the choice of model and algorithm have\nstrong consequences on what insights ecological studies can get using such\nmodels of species habitat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 12:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The erasure-floor performance of DLT codes improves with the\nmaximum degree of the relay-degree distribution. However, for conventional DLT\ncodes, the maximum degree is upper-bounded by the number of sources. An\nadditional constraint is that the sources are required to have the same\ninformation block length. We introduce a $D$-bit buffer for each source-relay\nlink, which allows the relay to select multiple encoded bits from the same\nsource for the relay-encoding process; thus, the number of sources no longer\nlimits the maximum degree at the relay. Furthermore, the introduction of\nbuffers facilitates the use of different information block sizes across\nsources. Based on density evolution we develop an asymptotic analytical\nframework for optimization of the relay-degree distribution. We further\nintegrate techniques for unequal erasure protection into the optimization\nframework. The proposed codes are considered for both lossless and lossy\nsource-relay links. Numerical examples show that there is no loss in erasure\nperformance for transmission over lossy source-relay links as compared to\nlossless links. Additional delays, however, may occur.

A direct evaluation of the sum\nscales quadratically with the number of points. Fast kernel summation methods\ncan reduce this cost to linear complexity, but the constants involved do not\nscale well with the dimensionality of the dataset.\n  The main algorithmic components of fast kernel summation algorithms are the\nseparation of the kernel sum between near and far field (which is the basis for\npruning) and the efficient and accurate approximation of the far field.\n  We introduce novel methods for pruning and approximating the far field.

To the best of our knowledge,\nthere has been no report on the bacterial interactions within the human milk\nmicrobiome. To bridge this gap, we reconstructed a milk bacterial community\nnetwork with the data from Hunt et al (2011), which is the largest 16S-rRNA\nsequence data set of human milk microbiome available to date. Our analysis\nrevealed that the milk microbiome network consists of two disconnected\nsub-networks.

In contrast, the interactions in the other\nsub-network of 8 nodes are mixed but dominantly cooperative.

In the limit of $\\rho$ going to\nzero, this model coincides with the usual dipolar spin-ice model at low\ntemperatures, with the additional advantage that a negligible number of\nmonopoles allows for equilibration even at the lowest temperatures. Thus, the\ntransition to the ordered fundamental state found by Melko et al. in 2001 is\nreached using simple local spin flip dynamics. As the density is increased, the\nmonopolar nature of the excitations becomes apparent: the system shows a rich\n$\\rho$ vs. $T$ phase diagram with \"charge\" ordering transitions analogous to\nthat observed for Coulomb charges in lattices. A further layer of complexity is\nrevealed by the existence of order both within the charges and their associated\nvacuum, which can only be described in terms of spins --the true microscopic\ndegrees of freedom of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 18:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}
