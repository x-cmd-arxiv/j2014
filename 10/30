Usually optical methods, such as angle and spin-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy, have been employed to observe the helical spin polarization in\nthe surface states of three-dimensional (3D) TIs up to room temperatures.\nRecently, spin polarized surface currents in 3D TIs were detected by electrical\nmethods using ferromagnetic (FM) contacts in a lateral spin-valve measurement\ngeometry. However, probing the spin texture with such electrical approaches is\nso far limited to temperatures below 125K, which restricts its application\npotential. Here we demonstrate the room temperature electrical detection of the\nspin polarization on the surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ due to SML by employing spin\nsensitive FM tunnel contacts. The current-induced spin polarization on the\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ surface is probed at room temperature by measuring a spin-valve\nsignal while switching the magnetization direction of the FM detector. The spin\nsignal increases linearly with current bias, reverses sign with current\ndirection, exhibits a weak temperature dependence and decreases with higher TI\nthickness, as predicted theoretically. Our results demonstrate the electrical\ndetection of the spin polarization on the surface of 3D TIs, which could lead\nto innovative spin-based quantum information technology at ambient\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 16:03:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 09:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Studies of\npulsars demonstrate that their electromagnetic (EM) emissions suffer from\n\\emph{timing noise}, small deviations in the phase from Taylor expansion\nmodels. How the mechanism producing EM emission is related to any continuous\ngravitational-wave (CW) emission is unknown; if they either interact or are\nlocked in phase then the CW will also experience timing noise. Any disparity\nbetween the signal and the search template used in matched filtering methods\nwill result in a loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), referred to as\n`mismatch'. In this work we assume the CW suffers a similar level of timing\nnoise to its EM counterpart. We inject and recover fake CW signals, which\ninclude timing noise generated from observational data on the Crab pulsar.\nMeasuring the mismatch over durations of order $\\sim 10$ months, the effect is\nfor the most part found to be small. This suggests recent so-called\n`narrow-band' searches which placed upper limits on the signals from the Crab\nand Vela pulsars will not be significantly affected. At a fixed observation\ntime, we find the mismatch depends upon the observation epoch. Considering the\naveraged mismatch as a function of observation time, we find that it increases\nas a power law with time, and so may become relevant in long baseline searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 16:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2015 14:07:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-30"}

The Monte Carlo\nmethod is used to simulate the magnetization in the temperature induced spin\ndisorder. The transport properties are evaluated from the transmission\nprobability obtained using the Baranger-Stone approach within the KKR-GF\nframework. We find qualitative and quantitative changes in the thermoelectric\nand spin-caloric coefficients when spin-disorder is included in the\ncalculation. Furthermore, we show that substitutional impurities in CrTe\nnanowires could considerably enhance the Seebeck coefficient and the\nthermoelectric figure of merit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 16:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The set of trees on a\nterrace can be characterized by enumeration algorithms or consensus methods\nthat exploit the pattern of partial taxon coverage in the data, independent of\nthe sequence data themselves. Terraces add ambiguity and complexity to\nphylogenetic inference particularly in settings where inference is already\nchallenging: data sets with many taxa and relatively few loci. In this paper we\npresent five new findings about terraces and their impacts on phylogenetic\ninference. First we clarify assumptions about model parameters that are\nnecessary for the existence of terraces. Second, we explore the dependence of\nterrace size on partitioning scheme and indicate how to find the partitioning\nscheme associated with the largest terrace containing a given tree. Third, we\nhighlight the impact of terraces on bootstrap estimates of confidence limits in\nclades, and characterize the surprising result that the bootstrap proportion\nfor a clade can be entirely determined by the frequency of bipartitions on a\nterrace, with some bipartitions receiving high support even when incorrect.\nFourth, we dissect some effects of prior distributions of edge lengths on the\ncomputed posterior probabilities of clades on terraces, to understand an\nexample in which long edges \"attract\" each other in Bayesian inference. Fifth,\nwe show that even if data are not partitioned, patterns of missing data studied\nin the terrace problem can lead to instances of apparent statistical\ninconsistency when even a small element of heterotachy is introduced to the\nmodel generating the sequence data. Finally, we discuss strategies for\nremediation of some of these problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 17:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-30"}

Additional\nelaborations have applied the same logic to the question of identical\nparticles, confirming the so-called Symmetrization Postulate [3]: that the only\ntwo options available are fermions and bosons [4,5]. However, this seems to run\ncounter to results in two-dimensional systems, which allow for anyons,\nparticles with statistics which interpolate between Fermi-Dirac and\nBose-Einstein (see [6] for a review).\n  In this talk we will show that the results in two dimensions can be made\ncompatible with the operational results. That is, we will show that anyonic\nbehavior is a result of the topology of the space in two dimensions [7], and\ndoes not depend on the particles being identical; but that nevertheless, if the\nparticles are identical, the resulting system is still anyonic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 18:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Viscous hydrodynamics results suggest RWI is excited\nonly when the viscosity changes over a radial distance less than two density\nscale heights. However in the disks around Solar-mass T Tauri stars, it is not\nviscosity but magnetic forces that provide the accretion stress beyond about 10\nAU, where surface densities are low enough so stellar X-rays and interstellar\ncosmic rays can penetrate. Here we aim to explore the conditions for RWI in the\nsmooth transition with increasing distance, from resistive and\nmagnetically-dead to conducting and magnetically-active. We perform 3D\nunstratified MHD simulations with the Pencil Code, using static resistivity\nprofiles. As a result, we find that in MHD, contrary to viscous models, the RWI\nis triggered even with a gradual change in resistivity extending from 10 to 40\nAU (i.e., spanning 15 scale heights for aspect ratio 0.1). This is because\nmagneto-rotational turbulence sets in abruptly when the resistivity reaches a\nthreshold level. At higher resistivities the longest unstable wavelength is\nquenched, resulting in a sharp decline of the Maxwell stress towards the star.\nThe sharp gradient in the magnetic forces leads to a localized density bump,\nthat is in turn Rossby wave unstable. We conclude that even weak gradients in\nthe resistivity can lead to sharp transitions in the Maxwell stress. The upshot\nis that the RWI is more easily activated in the outer disk than previously\nthought. Rossby vortices at the outer dead zone boundary thus could underlie\nthe dust asymmetries seen in the outer reaches of transition disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 18:43:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Nov 2014 01:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-21"}

It may decay preferentially to a top quark plus a\ntop-partner, which subsequently decays to a top quark plus a color-singlet\nstate. This singlet can serve as a WIMP dark-matter candidate.

The tilt\nangle between the circumbinary disk plane and the binary orbital plane is\nassumed to be very small. We find that there is a radius within/beyond which\nthe circumbinary disk is unstable to radiation-driven warping, depending on the\ndisk density and temperature gradient indices.

Since the tidal torques\ncan suppress the warping in the inner part of the circumbinary disk, the disk\nstarts to be warped in the outer part.

However, electron-ion equilibration timescales can be\ncomparable to the Hubble time in the low density galaxy cluster outskirts,\nleading to differences between the electron and ion temperatures. This\ntemperature difference can lead to systematic biases in cluster mass estimates\nand mass-observable scaling relations. To quantify the impact of\nnon-equilibrium electrons on the ICM profiles in cluster outskirts, we use a\nhigh resolution cosmological simulation with a two-temperature model assuming\nthe Spitzer equilibration timescale for the electrons. First, we show how the\nradial profile of this temperature bias depends on both the mass and mass\naccretion rate of the cluster; the bias is most pronounced in the most massive\nand most rapidly accreting clusters. For the most extreme case in our sample,\nwe find that the bias is of order 10% at half of the cluster virial radius and\nincreases to 40% at the edge of the cluster. We also find that gas in filaments\nis less susceptible to the non-equilibrium effect, leading to azimuthal\nvariations at large cluster-centric radii. By analyzing mock Chandra\nobservations of simulated clusters, we show that such azimuthal variations can\nbe probed with deep X-ray observations. Finally, the mass-dependent temperature\nbias introduces biases in hydrostatic mass and cluster temperature, which has\nimplications for cluster-based cosmological inferences. We provide a\nmass-dependent model for the temperature bias profile which can be useful for\nmodeling the effect of electron-ion equilibration in galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 20:00:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2015 14:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-20"}

ZVI is\nrobust and requires no special tuning of boundary conditions, or initial radial\nentropy or vortensity gradients (though we have studied ZVI only in the limit\nof infinite cooling time). The resolution of this paradox is that stable\nstratification allows for a new avenue to instability: baroclinic critical\nlayers.

Once begun, quenching is rapid (>~ 500 Myr) in low-mass galaxies\n(M* < 10^10 M_Sun), but significantly more protracted for more massive\nsatellites. The simulations predict a substantial role of outflows driven by\nram pressure -- but not tidal forces -- in removing the star-forming\ninterstellar matter (ISM) from satellite galaxies, especially dwarfs (M* ~ 10^9\nM_Sun) where they account for nearly two thirds of ISM loss in both groups and\nclusters.

Recent work has shown that power-law-like Fourier power spectra, also\nreferred to as 'red' noise processes, are an intrinsic property of solar and\nstellar flare signals, a property that many previous studies of this phenomenon\nhave not accounted for. Hence a re-evaluation of the existing interpretations\nand assumptions regarding QPP is needed. Here we adopt a Bayesian method for\ninvestigating this phenomenon, fully considering the Fourier power law\nproperties of flare signals. Using data from the PROBA2/LYRA, Fermi/GBM,\nNobeyama Radioheliograph and Yohkoh/HXT instruments, we study a selection of\nflares from the literature identified as QPP events. Additionally we examine\noptical data from a recent stellar flare that appears to exhibit oscillatory\nproperties. We find that, for all but one event tested, an explicit oscillation\nis not required in order to explain the observations. Instead, the flare\nsignals are adequately described as a manifestation of a power law in the\nFourier power spectrum, rather than a direct signature of oscillating\ncomponents or structures. However, for the flare of 1998 May 8, strong evidence\nfor the existence of an explicit oscillation with P ~ 14-16 s is found in the\n17 GHz radio data and the 13-23 keV Yohkoh HXT data. We conclude that, most\nlikely, many previously analysed events in the literature may be similarly\ndescribed in terms of power laws in the flare Fourier power spectrum, without\nthe need to invoke a narrowband, oscillatory component. As a result the\nprevalence of oscillatory signatures in solar and stellar flares may be less\nthan previously believed. The physical mechanism behind the appearance of the\nobserved power laws is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 20:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In each round, every informed node sends the rumor to a\nrandom neighbor, and every uninformed node contacts a random neighbor and gets\nthe rumor from her if she knows it. We analyze this protocol on random\n$k$-trees, a class of power law graphs, which are small-world and have large\nclustering coefficients, built as follows: initially we have a $k$-clique. In\nevery step a new node is born, a random $k$-clique of the current graph is\nchosen, and the new node is joined to all nodes of the $k$-clique. When $k>1$\nis fixed, we show that if initially a random node is aware of the rumor, then\nwith probability $1-o(1)$ after $O\\left((\\log n)^{1+2/k}\\cdot\\log\\log n\\cdot\nf(n)\\right)$ rounds the rumor propagates to $n-o(n)$ nodes, where $n$ is the\nnumber of nodes and $f(n)$ is any slowly growing function.

The analysis of stellar oscillations is one of the most reliable\nways to probe stellar interiors. Recent space missions such as Kepler have\nprovided us with an opportunity to study these oscillations with unprecedented\ndetail. For many multi-periodic pulsators such as {\\gamma} Doradus stars, this\nled to the detection of dozens to hundreds of oscillation frequencies that\ncould not be found from ground-based observations. Aims. We aim to detect\nnon-uniform period spacings in the Fourier spectra of a sample of {\\gamma}\nDoradus stars observed by Kepler. Such detection is complicated by both the\nlarge number of significant frequencies in the space photometry and by\noverlapping non-equidistant rotationally split multiplets. Methods. Guided by\ntheoretical properties of gravity-mode oscillation of {\\gamma} Doradus stars,\nwe developed a period-spacing detection method and applied it to Kepler\nobservations of a few stars, after having tested the performance from\nsimulations. Results. The application of the technique resulted in the clear\ndetection of non-uniform period spacing series for three out of the five\ntreated Kepler targets.

In the early time limit, since it corresponds to large\nspacetime curvatures, assuming that the Jordan frame is described by a general\nmetric that when it is conformally transformed to the Einstein frame, produces\nan accelerating Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, we found explicitly the\nscalar field dependence on time.

An interesting result is that\neven though, as expected, voids in the dark matter field are emptier in $f(R)$\ngravity due to the fifth force expelling away from the void centres, this\nresult is reversed when haloes are used to find voids. The abundance of voids\nin this case becomes even lower in $f(R)$ compared to GR for large voids.\nStill, the differences are significant and this provides a way to tell apart\nthese models. The velocity field differences between $f(R)$ and GR, on the\nother hand, are the same for halo voids and for dark matter voids. Paz et al.\n(2013), concentrate on the velocity profiles around voids. First they show the\nnecessity of four parameters to describe the density profiles around voids\ngiven two distinct void populations, voids-in-voids and voids-in-clouds. This\nprofile is used to predict peculiar velocities around voids, and the\ncombination of the latter with void density profiles allows the construction of\nmodel void-galaxy cross-correlation functions with redshift space distortions.\nWhen these models are tuned to fit the measured correlation functions for voids\nand galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, small voids are found to be of\nthe void-in-cloud type, whereas larger ones are consistent with being\nvoid-in-void. This is a novel result that is obtained directly from redshift\nspace data around voids. These profiles can be used to remove systematics on\nvoid-galaxy Alcock-Pacinsky tests coming from redshift-space distortions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 22:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-31"}

The frequency of the frozen mode is tuned by changing the lateral\nfeature parameters (period and duty cycle) of the grating.

A new estimator of the Ignorance score is derived which is\nunbiased with respect to the ensemble size.

Two closely related\nstrategies---noise contrastive estimation (Mnih and Teh, 2012; Mnih and\nKavukcuoglu, 2013; Vaswani et al., 2013) and negative sampling (Mikolov et al.,\n2012; Goldberg and Levy, 2014)---have emerged as popular solutions to this\ncomputational problem, but some confusion remains as to which is more\nappropriate and when. This document explicates their relationships to each\nother and to other estimation techniques.

Examples illustrating how laboratory scale facilities can be used to\nextract crucial information about defects are given. As a case study a\nstatistical approximation model for lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) is\nintroduced. PZT is a material possessing several defect types, including\nsubstitutional, displacement and surface defects. Spatial composition variation\nis taken into account by introducing a model in which the edge lengths of each\ncell depend on the distribution of Zr and Ti ions in the cluster. Spatially\nvarying edge lengths and angles are referred to as microstrain. The Pb, Zr and\nTi cation positions were adjusted by bond-valence sum (BVS) model to fullfil\nnominal valence requirement. The model is applied to compute the scattering\nfrom ellipsoid shaped PZT clusters and to simulate the structural changes as a\nfunction of average composition.

These results are then fitted with\na differential rotation law to compare the data of the three observers with\neach other and with the results published by other authors. Finally, a study is\nmade of the possible relationship between the sunspot group areas as determined\nby de la Rue and the corresponding sunspot group velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 08:22:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-16"}

Consequently, models for line emissivities suffer from uncertainties which\nin turn affect the determination of the physical conditions at the base of line\nexcitation. We provide an empirical determination of the A-coefficient ratios\nof bright [Fe II] lines, which would represent both a valid benchmark for\ntheoretical computations and a reference for the physical interpretation of the\nobserved lines. With the ESO-VLT X-shooter instrument between 3,000 A, and\n24,700 A, we obtained a spectrum of the bright Herbig-Haro object HH1. We\ndetect around 100 [Fe II] lines, some of which with a signal-to-noise ratio >\n100. Among these latter, we selected those emitted by the same level, whose\nde-reddened intensity ratio is a direct function of the Einstein A-coefficient\nratios. From the same X-shooter spectrum, we got an accurate estimate of the\nextinction toward HH1 through intensity ratios of atomic species, HI,\nrecombination lines and H_2 ro-vibrational transitions. We provide seven\nreliable A-ooefficient ratios between bright [Fe II] lines, which are compared\nwith the literature determinations. In particular, the A-coefficient ratios\ninvolving the brightest near-infrared lines (12570A/16440A and 13209A/16440A)\nare better in agreement with the predictions by Quinet et al.

The paper proceeds by: taking variations in the SVP to derive\nstochastic Stratonovich fluid equations; writing their It\\^o representation;\nand then investigating the properties of these stochastic fluid models in\ncomparison with each other, and with the corresponding deterministic fluid\nmodels. The circulation properties of the stochastic Stratonovich fluid\nequations are found to closely mimic those of the deterministic ideal fluid\nmodels. As with deterministic ideal flows, motion along the stochastic\nStratonovich paths also preserves the helicity of the vortex field lines in\nincompressible stochastic flows.

Among the proposed methods, molecular\ncommunication via diffusion (MCvD) is particularly effective. One of the main\nchallenges in MCvD is the intersymbol interference (ISI), which inhibits\ncommunication at high data rates. Furthermore, at the nano scale, energy\nefficiency becomes an essential problem. Before addressing these problems, a\npre-determined threshold for the received signal must be calculated to make a\ndecision. In this paper, an analytical technique is proposed to determine the\noptimum threshold, whereas in the literature, these thresholds are generally\ncalculated empirically. Since the main goal of this paper is to build an MCvD\nsystem suitable for operating at high data rates without sacrificing quality,\nnew modulation and filtering techniques are proposed to decrease the effects of\nISI and enhance energy efficiency. As a transmitter-based solution, a\nmodulation technique for MCvD, molecular transition shift keying (MTSK), is\nproposed in order to increase the data rate via suppressing the ISI.\nFurthermore, for energy efficiency, a power adjustment technique that utilizes\nthe residual molecules is proposed. Finally, as a receiver-based solution, a\nnew energy efficient decision feedback filter (DFF) is proposed as a substitute\nfor the decoders such as minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and decision\nfeedback equalizer (DFE). The error performance of DFF and MMSE equalizers are\ncompared in terms of bit error rates, and it is concluded that DFF may be more\nadvantageous when energy efficiency is concerned, due to its lower\ncomputational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 10:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-31"}

They later guess simultaneously the outcome\nof their own die. Their objective is to find a strategy which maximises the\nprobability that they all guess correctly. The performance of the optimal\nstrategy for a graph is measured by the guessing number of the digraph.\n  Christofides and Markstr\\\"om studied guessing numbers of undirected graphs\nand defined a strategy which they conjectured to be optimal. One of the main\nresults of this paper is a disproof of this conjecture.\n  The main tool so far for computing guessing numbers of graphs is information\ntheoretic inequalities. In the paper we show that Shannon's information\ninequalities, which work particularly well for a wide range of graph classes,\nare not sufficient for computing the guessing number.\n  Finally we pose a few more interesting questions some of which we can answer\nand some which we leave as open problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 12:38:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2014 10:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-04"}

All show extended\nradio eclipses associated with circumbinary material. They do not lie on the\nperiod-companion mass relation expected from the canonical intermediate-mass\nX-ray binary evolution in which the companion filled its Roche lobe as a red\ngiant and has now lost its envelope and cooled as a white dwarf. The redbacks\nlie closer to, but usually at higher period than, the period-companion mass\nrelation followed by cataclysmic variables and low-mass X-ray binaries. In\norder to turn on as a pulsar mass accretion on to a neutron star must be\nsufficiently weak, considerably weaker than expected in systems with low-mass\nmain-sequence companions driven together by magnetic braking or gravitational\nradiation. If a neutron star is formed by accretion induced collapse of a white\ndwarf as it approaches the Chandrasekhar limit some baryonic mass is abruptly\nlost to its binding energy so that its effective gravitational mass falls. We\npropose that redbacks form when accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf\ntakes place during cataclysmic variable binary evolution because the loss of\ngravitational mass makes the orbit expand suddenly so that the companion no\nlonger fills its Roche lobe. Once activated, the pulsar can ablate its\ncompanion and so further expand the orbit and also account for the extended\neclipses in the radio emission of the pulsar that are characteristic of these\nsystems. The whole period-companion mass space occupied by the redbacks can be\npopulated in this way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 12:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In contrast,\nthe same $f(R)$ voids are more empty of dark matter, and their profiles are\nsteeper. This can in principle be observed by weak gravitational lensing of\nvoids, for which the combination of a spectroscopic redshift and a lensing\nphotometric redshift survey over the same sky is required. Neglecting the\nlensing shape noise, the $f(R)$ model parameter amplitudes $|f_{R0}|=10^{-5}$\nand $10^{-4}$ may be distinguished from GR using the lensing tangential shear\nsignal around voids by 4 and 8$\\sigma$ for a volume of 1~(Gpc/$h$)$^3$.

Recent studies suggest that AGN can regulate the gas accretion and\nthus slow down star formation (negative feedback). However, evidence of AGN\npositive feedback has also been observed in a few radio galaxies (eg. Centaurus\nA).\n  Here we present CO observations of 3C 285 and Minkowski Object (MO), which\nare examples of jet-induced star formation. A spot (named 09.6) aligned with\nthe 3C 285 radio jet, at a projected distance of ~70 kpc from the galaxy\ncentre, shows star formation, detected in optical emission. MO is located along\nthe jet of NGC 541 and also shows star formation. To know the distribution of\nmolecular gas along the jets is a way to study the physical processes at play\nin the AGN interaction with the intergalactic medium.\n  We observed CO lines in 3C 285, NGC 541, 09.6 and MO with the IRAM-30m\ntelescope. In the central galaxies, the spectra present a double-horn profile,\ntypical of a rotation pattern, from which we are able to estimate the molecular\ngas density profile of the galaxy. The molecular gas appears to be in a compact\nreservoir. In addition, no kinematic signature of a molecular outflow is\ndetected by the 30m-telescope.\n  Interestingly, 09.6 and MO are not detected in CO. The cold gas mass upper\nlimits are consistent with a star formation induced by the compression of dense\nambient material by the jet. The depletion time scales are of the order of and\neven smaller than what is found in 3C 285, NGC 541 and local spiral galaxies\n(10^9 yr). The molecular gas surface density in 09.6 follows a\nSchmidt-Kennicutt law if the emitting region is very compact, while MO is found\nto have a much higher SFE (very short depletion time). Higher sensitivity and\nspatial resolution are necessary to detect CO in the spots of star formation,\nand map the emission in these jet-induced star forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 13:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-21"}

The result differs substantially from the customary picture of the\nradial speed-of-light motion of massless particles. In our case, the electron\nand positron constituents follow slightly curved trajectories and are\ncharacterized by definite number densities and distinct velocities. The\nvelocity shift is determined by the first-order longitudinal electric field,\nwhich appears the necessary ingredient of the self-consistent two-fluid model\nand implies the parallel conductivity of the order of the inverse particle\nmass.

In order to determine the critical condition in which dust cooling\ninduces the formation of low-mass stars, we follow the thermal evolution of a\ncollapsing cloud by a one-zone semi-analytic collapse model. Earlier studies\nassume the dust amount in the local universe, where all refractory elements are\ndepleted onto grains, and/or assume the constant dust amount during gas\ncollapse.

We find that grain\ngrowth well alters the fragmentation property of the clouds, and that this\nstill does not approach to the value in the local universe.

For the ensemble of binary\nconstant-weight codes we develop a random coding method to obtain lower bounds\non the rate of these codes.

These gels\nundergo spontaneous aging, called syneresis that consists in the shrinkage of\nthe gel matrix and the progressive expulsion of the solvent. As a result, a\nbiogel originally casted in a container often lose contact with the container\nsidewalls, and the detachment time is a priori difficult to anticipate since it\nmay occur over variable time spans (from hours to days). Here we report on the\nsyneresis phenomena in agar plates that consist in Petri dishes filled with a\ngel mainly composed of agar. Direct observations and speckle pattern\ncorrelation analysis allow us to rationalize the delayed detachment of the gel\nfrom the sidewall of the Petri dish. The detachment time $t^*$ is surprisingly\nnot controlled by the mass loss as one would intuitively expect. Instead, $t^*$\nis strongly correlated to the gel minimum thickness $e_{min}$ measured along\nthe sidewall of the plate, and increases as a robust function of $e_{min}$\nindependently of the prior mass-loss history. Time-resolved correlation\nspectroscopy atypically applied to such weakly diffusive media gives access to\nthe local thinning rate of the gel. This technique also allows us to detect the\ngel micro-displacements that are triggered by the water evaporation prior to\nthe detachment, and even to anticipate the latter from a few hours.

It is found that a non terminating Computation will\nbe almost surely chaotic, and autonomous learning will almost surely identify\nfractal only sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 15:21:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-31"}

Despite strong performance for a number of clustering tasks,\nspectral graph cut algorithms still suffer from several limitations: first,\nthey require the number of clusters to be known in advance, but this\ninformation is often unknown a priori; second, they tend to produce clusters\nwith uniform sizes. In some cases, the true clusters exhibit a known size\ndistribution; in image segmentation, for instance, human-segmented images tend\nto yield segment sizes that follow a power-law distribution. In this paper, we\npropose a general framework of power-law graph cut algorithms that produce\nclusters whose sizes are power-law distributed, and also does not fix the\nnumber of clusters upfront. To achieve our goals, we treat the Pitman-Yor\nexchangeable partition probability function (EPPF) as a regularizer to graph\ncut objectives. Because the resulting objectives cannot be solved by relaxing\nvia eigenvectors, we derive a simple iterative algorithm to locally optimize\nthe objectives. Moreover, we show that our proposed algorithm can be viewed as\nperforming MAP inference on a particular Pitman-Yor mixture model. Our\nexperiments on various data sets show the effectiveness of our algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 20:46:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 21:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-27"}
