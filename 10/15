A pore-scale two-phase multi-mixture model based on the lattice\nBoltzmann method (LBM) is developed for such complex transport processes, where\neach phase is considered as a mixture of miscible components in it. The\nliquid-gas fluid flow with large density ratio is simulated using the\nmulticomponent multiphase pseudo-potential LB model; the transport of certain\nsolute in the corresponding solvent is solved using the mass transport LB\nmodel; and the dynamic evolutions of the liquid-solid interface due to\ndissolution-precipitation are captured by an interface tracking scheme. The\nmodel developed can predict coupled multiple physicochemical processes\nincluding multiphase flow, multicomponent mass transport, homogeneous reactions\nin the bulk fluid and heterogeneous dissolution-precipitation reactions at the\nfluid-solid interface, and dynamic evolution of the solid matrix geometries at\nthe pore-scale. The model is then applied to a physicochemical system\nencountered in shale gas/oil industry involving multiphase flow, multicomponent\nreactive transport and dissolution-precipitation, with several reactions whose\nrates can be several orders of magnitude different at a given temperature.

One of the\nunderlying principles of this model is the compositeness condition which means\nthat the wave function renormalization constant of the elementary hadron is\nequal to zero. In particular, this equation allows to express the Yukawa\ncoupling of the meson fields to the constituent quarks as a function of other\nmodel parameters. In addition to the compositeness condition we also employ a\nfurther equation which relates the meson mass function to the Fermi coupling.\nBoth equations guarantee that the Yukawa-type theory is equivalent to the\nFermi-type theory thereby providing an interpretation of the meson field as the\nbound state of its constituent fermions (quarks). We evaluate the\nFermi-coupling as a function of meson (pseudoscalar and vector) masses and vary\nthe values of the masses in such a way to obtain a smooth behavior for the\nresulting curve. The mass spectrum obtained in this manner is found to be in\ngood agreement with the experimental data. We also compare the behavior of our\nFermi-coupling with the strong QCD coupling alpha_s calculated in an\nQCD-inspired approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 16:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-02"}

I will\ndescribe physical mechanisms such as relativistic hydrodynamics, tidal forces\nand non thermal emission. I will highlight how high energy astrophysics can\nshed a new light on Be star physics and vice-versa.

This pattern was attributed to a\nvertical corrugation, and its temporal variability implied that some event\n--possibly an impact with interplanetary debris-- caused the ring to become\ntilted out the planet's equatorial plane in 1983. This work examines these\npatterns in greater detail using a more extensive set of Cassini images in\norder to obtain additional insights into the 1983 event. These additional data\nreveal that the D ring is not only corrugated, but also contains a\ntime-variable periodic modulation in its optical depth that probably represents\norganized eccentric motions of the D-ring's particles. This second pattern\nsuggests that whatever event tilted the rings also disturbed the radial or\nazimuthal velocities of the ring particles. Furthermore, the relative\namplitudes of the two patterns indicate that the vertical motions induced by\nthe 1983 event were 2.3+/-0.5 times larger than the corresponding in-plane\nmotions. If these structures were indeed produced by an impact, material would\nneed to strike the ring at a steep angle (more than 60 degrees from the ring\nplane) to produce such motions. Meanwhile, the corrugation wavelengths in the D\nring are about 0.7% shorter than one would predict based on extrapolations from\nsimilar structures in the nearby C ring. This could indicate that the D-ring\nwas tilted/disturbed about 60 days before the C ring. Such a timing difference\ncould be explained if the material that struck the ring was derived from debris\nreleased when some object broke up near Saturn some months earlier. This debris\nwould need to have a substantial initial velocity dispersion and have its\norbital properties perturbed by solar tides prior to its collision with the\nrings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 16:43:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 15:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The low detection limit of LF assays and associated long\nequilibration times is due to kinetically limited surface reactions that result\nfrom low target concentrations.

Moreover, towards hybrid systems for\nquantum memories and transducers, coupling of magnons and microwave photons in\na resonator have been investigated. However, quantum-state manipulation at the\nsingle-magnon level has remained elusive because of the lack of anharmonic\nelement in the system. Here we demonstrate coherent coupling between a magnon\nexcitation in a millimetre-sized ferromagnetic sphere and a superconducting\nqubit, where the interaction is mediated by the virtual photon excitation in a\nmicrowave cavity. We obtain the coupling strength far exceeding the damping\nrates, thus bringing the hybrid system into the strong coupling regime.\nFurthermore, we find a tunable magnon-qubit coupling scheme utilising a\nparametric drive with a microwave. Our approach provides a versatile tool for\nquantum control and measurement of the magnon excitations and thus opens a new\ndiscipline of quantum magnonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 18:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-15"}

The observed anomaly in the positron fraction triggered a\nlot of excitement, as it could be interpreted as an indirect signature of the\npresence of dark matter species in the Galaxy. Alternatively, it could be\nproduced by nearby astrophysical sources, such as pulsars. Both hypotheses are\nprobed in this work in light of the latest AMS-02 positron fraction\nmeasurements. The transport of the primary and secondary positrons in the\nGalaxy is described using a semi-analytic two-zone model. MicrOMEGAs is used to\nmodel the positron flux generated by dark matter species.

Yet, within a\nCE, accretion structures may span a large fraction of the envelope radius, and\nin so doing sweep across a substantial radial gradient of density. We quantify\nthese gradients using detailed stellar evolution models for a range of CE\nencounters. We provide estimates of typical scales in CE encounters that\ninvolve main sequence stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes with\ngiant-branch companions of a wide range of masses. We apply these typical\nscales to hydrodynamic simulations of 3D HLA with an upstream density gradient.\nThis density gradient breaks the symmetry that defines HLA flow, and imposes an\nangular momentum barrier to accretion. Material that is focused into the\nvicinity of the embedded object thus may not be able to accrete. As a result,\naccretion rates drop dramatically, by 1-2 orders of magnitude, while drag rates\nare only mildly affected. We provide fitting formulae to the\nnumerically-derived rates of drag and accretion as a function of the density\ngradient.

In astronomy, the prevalence of systematics --- both\n\"known unknowns\" and \"unknown unknowns\" --- combined with increasingly large\ndatasets, the widespread use of ad hoc estimators for anomaly detection, and\nthe \"look-elsewhere\" effect, can lead to spurious false detections. In this\ninformal note, I argue that anomaly detection leading to discoveries of new\nphysics requires a combination of physical understanding, careful experimental\ndesign to avoid confirmation bias, and self-consistent statistical methods.\nThese points are illustrated with several concrete examples from cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 20:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-16"}

Often\nit is particularly these detailed observations (facts) that are of interest,\nand thus specific to the research questions that motivated observing and\nreporting them. However, research aiming to synthesize or integrate phenotype\ndata across many studies or even fields is often faced with the need to\nabstract from detailed observations so as to construct phenotypic concepts that\nare common across many datasets rather than specific to a few. Yet,\nobservations or facts that would fall under such abstracted concepts are\ntypically not directly asserted by the original authors, usually because they\nare \"obvious\" according to common domain knowledge, and thus asserting them\nwould be deemed redundant by anyone with sufficient domain knowledge. For\nexample, a phenotype describing the length of a manual digit for an organism\nimplicitly means that the organism must have had a hand, and thus a forelimb;\nthe presence or absence of a forelimb may have supporting data across a far\nwider range of taxa than the length of a particular manual digit. Here we\ndescribe how within the Phenoscape project we use a pipeline of OWL axiom\ngeneration and reasoning steps to infer taxon-specific presence/absence of\nanatomical entities from anatomical phenotypes. Although presence/absence is\nall but one, and a seemingly simple way to abstract phenotypes across data\nsources, it can nonetheless be powerful for linking genotype to phenotype, and\nit is particularly relevant for constructing synthetic morphological\nsupermatrices for comparative analysis; in fact presence/absence is one of the\nprevailing character observation types in published character matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 20:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-16"}

The proper motion of these features\ngenerally increases with distance to the central star, but the fractional\nexpansion decreases, i.e., the expansion is not homologous. As a result, there\nis not a unique expansion age, which is estimated to be 610-950 yr for A30 and\n600-1140 yr for A78. The knots and filaments have experienced complex dynamical\nprocesses: the current fast stellar wind is mass loaded by the material ablated\nfrom the inner knots; the ablated material is then swept up until it shocks the\ninner edges of the outer, hydrogen-rich nebula.

For closed quantum\nsystems the relevant input/output maps are unitary transformations, and the\nfundamental challenge becomes how to implement these with high fidelity in the\npresence of experimental imperfections and decoherence. For two-level systems\n(qubits) most aspects of unitary control are well understood, but for systems\nwith Hilbert space dimension d>2 (qudits), many questions remain regarding the\noptimal design of control Hamiltonians and the feasibility of robust\nimplementation. Here we show that arbitrary, randomly chosen unitary\ntransformations can be efficiently designed and implemented in a large\ndimensional Hilbert space (d=16) associated with the electronic ground state of\natomic 133Cs, achieving fidelities above 0.98 as measured by randomized\nbenchmarking. Generalizing the concepts of inhomogeneous control and dynamical\ndecoupling to d>2 systems, we further demonstrate that these qudit unitary maps\ncan be made robust to both static and dynamic perturbations.

First, it is proved that if the incoming flow is away\nfrom the sonic and vacuum state and its streamlines are rarefactive at the\ninlet, then a flow in a straight nozzle never approaches the sonic and vacuum\nstate in any bounded region. Furthermore, a sufficient and necessary condition\nof the incoming flow at the inlet is derived for the existence of a global\nsmooth supersonic flow in a straight nozzle. Then, it is shown that for each\nincoming flow satisfying this condition, there exists uniquely a global smooth\nsupersonic flow in a symmetric nozzle with convex upper wall. It is noted that\nsuch a flow may contain a vacuum. If there is a vacuum for a global smooth\ntransonic flow in a symmetric nozzle with convex upper wall, it is proved that\nfor the symmetric upper part of the flow, the first vacuum point along the\nsymmetric axis must be located at the upper wall and the set of vacuum points\nis the closed domain bounded by the tangent half-line of the upper wall at this\npoint to downstream and the upper wall after this point. Moreover, the flow\nspeed is globally Lipschitz continuous in the nozzle, and on the boundary\nbetween the gas and the vacuum, the flow velocity is along this boundary and\nthe normal derivatives of the flow speed and the square of the sound speed both\nare zero.

In this paper, the concept of local set is\nintroduced and two local-set-based iterative methods are proposed to\nreconstruct bandlimited graph signal from sampled data. In each iteration, one\nof the proposed methods reweights the sampled residuals for different vertices,\nwhile the other propagates the sampled residuals in their respective local\nsets. These algorithms are built on frame theory and the concept of local sets,\nbased on which several frames and contraction operators are proposed. We then\nprove that the reconstruction methods converge to the original signal under\ncertain conditions and demonstrate the new methods lead to a significantly\nfaster convergence compared with the baseline method. Furthermore, the\ncorrespondence between graph signal sampling and time-domain irregular sampling\nis analyzed comprehensively, which may be helpful to future works on graph\nsignals.

The experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the reconstruction methods in various sampling\ngeometries, imprecise priori knowledge of cutoff frequency, and noisy\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 07:05:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Jan 2015 12:51:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 12:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Yet, the set of tools that can characterize such a weighted\ncycle-rich architecture in a physically relevant, mathematically compact way is\nsparse. In order to fill this void, we have developed a new algorithm that\nrests on an abstraction of the physical `tiling' in the case of a two\ndimensional network to an effective tiling of an abstract surface in space that\nthe network may be thought to sit in. Generically these abstract surfaces are\nricher than the flat plane and as a result there are now two families of\nfundamental units that may aggregate upon cutting weakest links -- the\nplaquettes of the tiling and the longer `topological' cycles associated with\nthe abstract surface itself. Upon sequential removal of the weakest links, as\ndetermined by the edge weight, neighboring plaquettes merge and a tree\ncharacterizing this merging process results. The properties of this\ncharacteristic tree can provide the physical and topological data required to\ndescribe the architecture of the network and to build physical models.

When the population totals of some auxiliary variables are known\nand when the inclusion probabilities are known by design, survey statisticians\nhave developed calibration methods for improving efficiencies of the inverse\nprobability weighting estimators and the methods can be applied to missing data\nanalysis. Model-based calibration has been proposed in the survey sampling\nliterature, where multidimensional auxiliary variables are first summarized\ninto a predictor function from a working regression model. Usually, one working\nmodel is being proposed for each parameter of interest and results in different\nsets of calibration weights for estimating different parameters. This paper\nconsiders calibration using multiple working regression models for estimating a\nsingle or multiple parameters. Contrary to a common belief that overfitting\nhurts efficiency, we present three rather unexpected results. First, when the\nmissing probability is correctly specified and multiple working regression\nmodels for the conditional mean are posited, calibration enjoys an oracle\nproperty: the same semiparametric efficiency bound is attained as if the true\noutcome model is known in advance. Second, when the missing data mechanism is\nmisspecified, calibration can still be a consistent estimator when any one of\nthe outcome regression models is correctly specified. Third, a common set of\ncalibration weights can be used to improve efficiency in estimating multiple\nparameters of interest and can simultaneously attain semiparametric efficiency\nbounds for all parameters of interest. We provide connections of a wide class\nof calibration estimators, constructed based on generalized empirical\nlikelihood, to many existing estimators in biostatistics, econometrics and\nsurvey sampling and perform simulation studies to show that the finite sample\nproperties of calibration estimators conform well with the theoretical results\nbeing studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 08:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-16"}

At first glance, it seems\nto be bizarre and even ridiculous to apply ideas of quantum physics in order to\nimprove current psychological and linguistic or semantic ideas. However, a\ncloser look shows that there are some parallels in the development of quantum\nphysics and advanced theories of cognitive science. In psychology, geometric\nmodels of meaning have a long tradition. However, they suffer from many\nshortcomings which are illustrated by discussing several puzzles of bounded\nrationality. In the first part of this article, we argue that the present\naccount of quantum cognition - taking quantum probabilities rather than\nclassical probabilities - can give a more systematic description of these\npuzzles than the alternate and rather eclectic treatments in the traditional\nframework of bounded rationality. Unfortunately, the quantum probabilistic\ntreatment does not always and does not automatically provide a deeper\nunderstanding and a true explanation of these puzzles. In the second part of\nthis article, we explain the foundational issue from the perspective of Piron,\nFoulis, Randall, and others, and we apply it to the foundation of quantum\ncognition. In this connection, we show that quantum probabilities are of\n(virtual) conceptual necessity if grounded in an abstract algebraic framework\nof orthomodular lattices. This framework is motivated by assuming partial\nBoolean algebras (describing particular perspectives) that are combined into a\nuniform system while considering certain capacity restrictions. It is at this\npoint that one important aspect of the whole idea of bounded rationality\ndirectly enters the theoretical scenery of quantum cognition: resource\nlimitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 08:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-16"}

An alternative integral representation is also\ndisplayed, which relies upon the method of integration in the complex domain\nfor the solution of hyperbolic equations with variable coefficients. In order\nto study the propagation of wave fronts, we integrate the equations of\nbicharacteristics which are null geodesics, and we are able to express them,\nfor the first time in the literature, with the help of elliptic integrals for\nanother choice of Kasner parameters. For generic values of the three Kasner\nparameters, the solution of the Cauchy problem is built through a pair of\nintegral operators, where the amplitude and phase functions in the integrand\nsolve a coupled system of partial differential equations. The first is the\nso-called transport equation, whereas the second is a nonlinear equation that\nreduces to the eikonal equation if the amplitude is a slowly varying function.\nRemarkably, the analysis of such a coupled system is proved to be equivalent to\nbuilding first an auxiliary covariant vector having vanishing divergence, while\nall nonlinearities are mapped into solving a covariant generalization of the\nErmakov-Pinney equation for the amplitude function. Last, from a linear set of\nequations for the gradient of the phase one recovers the phase itself. This is\nthe parametrix construction that relies upon Fourier-Maslov integral operators,\nbut with a novel perspective on the nonlinearities in the dispersion relation.\nFurthermore, the Adomian method for nonlinear partial differential equations is\napplied to generate a recursive scheme for the evaluation of the amplitude\nfunction in the parametrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 08:44:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 20:34:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Feb 2015 15:13:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 17:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

The approximation is obtained by optimizing a linear\nfunctional defined in terms of transition probabilities of the reduced order\nMarkov process over a total variation distance constraint.

However, most\nof the previous works on VANET performance modeling paid little attention to\nvehicle distribution, or simply assumed homogeneous car distribution. It is\nobvious that vehicles are distributed non-homogeneously along a road segment\ndue to traffic signals and speed limits at different portions of the road, as\nwell as vehicle interactions that are significant on busy streets. In light of\nthe inadequacy, we present in this paper an original methodology to study the\nbroadcasting performance of 802.11p VANETs with practical vehicle distribution\nin urban environments. Firstly, we adopt the empirically verified stochastic\ntraffic models, which incorporates the effect of urban settings (such as\ntraffic lights and vehicle interactions) on car distribution and generates\npractical vehicular density profiles. Corresponding 802.11p protocol and\nperformance models are then developed. When coupled with the traffic models,\nthey can predict broadcasting efficiency, delay, as well as throughput\nperformance of 802.11p VANETs based on the knowledge of car density at each\nlocation on the road. Extensive simulation is conducted to verify the accuracy\nof the developed mathematical models with the consideration of vehicle\ninteraction. In general, our results demonstrate the applicability of the\nproposed methodology on modeling protocol performance in practical signalized\nroad networks, and shed insights into the design and development of future\ncommunication protocols and networking functions for VANETs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 09:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Its focus is on the\nfollowing two aspects: (i) The stochastic nature of mesoscopic observations has\nits origin in the molecular chaos on the microscopic level. Can one derive ST\nfrom an underlying reversible deterministic dynamics? Can we interpret ST's\nnotions of entropy and entropy changes in a well-defined\ninformation-theoretical framework?

They rule out any large sphere of water vapour in LTE surrounding red\ngiants. Our aim here is to investigate high-resolution, mid-infrared spectra\nfor a range of red giants, from early-K to mid M. We have recorded 12 microns\nspectra of 10 well-studied bright red giants, with TEXES on the IRTF. We find\nthat all giants in our study cooler than 4300 K, spanning a range of effective\ntemperatures, show water absorption lines stronger than expected. The strengths\nof the lines vary smoothly with spectral type. We identify several spectral\nfeatures in the wavelength region that undoubtedly are formed in the\nphotosphere. From a study of water-line ratios of the stars, we find that the\nexcitation temperatures, in the line-forming regions, are several hundred\nKelvin lower than expected from a classical photospheric model. This could\neither be due to an actually lower temperature structure in the outer regions\nof the photospheres caused by, for example, extra cooling, or due to non-LTE\nlevel populations, affecting the source function and line opacities. We have\ndemonstrated that these diagnostically interesting water lines are a general\nfeature of red giants across spectral types, and we argue for a general\nexplanation of their formation rather than explanations requiring specific\nproperties. Since the water lines are neither weak (filled in by emission) nor\nappear in emission, as predicted by LTE MOLsphere models in their simplest\nforms, the evidence for the existence of such large optically-thick, molecular\nspheres enshrouding the stars is weakened.

In Hubbell's Unified Neutral Theory of\nBiodiversity (UNTB), many local communities are connected to a single\nmetacommunity through differing immigration rates. Our ability to fit the full\nmulti-site UNTB has hitherto been limited by the lack of a computationally\ntractable and accurate algorithm. We show that a large class of neutral models\nwith this mainland-island structure but differing local community dynamics\nconverge in the large population limit to the hierarchical Dirichlet process.\nUsing this approximation we developed an efficient Bayesian fitting strategy\nfor the multi-site UNTB. We can also use this approach to distinguish between\nneutral local community assembly given a non-neutral metacommunity distribution\nand the full UNTB where the metacommunity too assembles neutrally. We applied\nthis fitting strategy to both tropical trees and a data set comprising 570,851\nsequences from 278 human gut microbiomes. The tropical tree data set was\nconsistent with the UNTB but for the human gut neutrality was rejected at the\nwhole community level. However, when we applied the algorithm to gut microbial\nspecies within the same taxon at different levels of taxonomic resolution, we\nfound that species abundances within some genera were almost consistent with\nlocal community assembly. This was not true at higher taxonomic ranks. This\nsuggests that the gut microbiota is more strongly niche constrained than\nmacroscopic organisms, with different groups adopting different functional\nroles, but within those groups diversity may at least partially be maintained\nby neutrality.We also observed a negative correlation between body mass index\nand immigration rates within the family Ruminococcaceae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 12:35:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 2020 18:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

We\npresent a NIR imaging (H2 and Ks) and low-resolution spectroscopic (0.95-2.50\num) survey of 18 massive jets towards GLIMPSE extended green objects, driven by\nintermediate- and high-mass YSOs, which have Lbol between 4x10^2 and 10^5 Lsun.\nAs in low-mass jets, H2 is the primary NIR coolant, detected in all the\nanalysed flows, whereas the most important ionic tracer is [FeII], detected in\nhalf of the sampled jets. Our analysis indicates that the emission lines\noriginate from shocks at high temperatures and densities. No fluorescent\nemission is detected along the flows, regardless of the source Lbol. On\naverage, the physical parameters of these massive jets (i.e. Av, temperature,\ncolumn density, mass, and luminosity) have higher values than those measured in\ntheir low-mass counterparts. The morphology of the H2 flows is varied, mostly\ndepending on the complex, dynamic, and inhomogeneous environment in which these\nmassive jets form and propagate. All flows and jets in our sample are\ncollimated, showing large precession angles. Additionally, the presence of both\nknots and jets suggests that the ejection process is continuous with burst\nepisodes, as in low-mass YSOs. We compare the flow H2 luminosity with the\nsource Lbol confirming the tight correlation between these two quantities. Five\nsources, however, display a lower L(H2)/Lbol efficiency, which might be related\nto YSO evolution. Most important, the inferred L(H2) vs Lbol relationship\nagrees well with the correlation between the momentum flux of the CO outflows\nand the bolometric luminosities of high-mass YSOs indicating that outflows from\nhigh-mass YSOs are momentum driven, as are their low-mass counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 12:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

The conditions under which this decoupling procedure\nworks are discussed, and the method is illustrated on several numerical\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 13:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-08"}

Kannan,\nM. Naor, S. Rudich, Implicit representation of graphs, SIAM J. Discrete\nMathematics, 5 (1992) 596--603] and can be defined as follows. A representation\nof an $n$-vertex graph $G$ is said to be implicit if it assigns to each vertex\nof $G$ a binary code of length $O(\\log n)$ so that the adjacency of two\nvertices is a function of their codes. Since an implicit representation of an\n$n$-vertex graph uses $O(n\\log n)$ bits, any class of graphs admitting such a\nrepresentation contains $2^{O(n\\log n)}$ labelled graphs with $n$ vertices. In\nthe terminology of [J. Balogh, B. Bollob\\'{a}s, D. Weinreich, The speed of\nhereditary properties of graphs, J. Combin. Theory B 79 (2000) 131--156] such\nclasses have at most factorial speed of growth. In this terminology, the\nimplicit graph conjecture can be stated as follows: every class with at most\nfactorial speed of growth which is hereditary admits an implicit\nrepresentation. The question of deciding whether a given hereditary class has\nat most factorial speed of growth is far from being trivial. In the present\npaper, we introduce a number of tools simplifying this question. Some of them\ncan be used to obtain a stronger conclusion on the existence of an implicit\nrepresentation. We apply our tools to reveal new hereditary classes with the\nfactorial speed of growth. For many of them we show the existence of an\nimplicit representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 14:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-16"}

Maximizing the protein production rate in mRNA translation,\nsubject to the bounded biomolecullar budget, is thus an important problem in\nboth biology and biotechnology. We consider this problem using a mathematical\nmodel for mRNA translation called the ribosome flow model (RFM). For an mRNA\nstrand with $n$ sites the RFM includes $n$ state-variables that encode the\nnormalized ribosomal density at each site, and $n+1$ positive parameters: the\ninitiation rate and elongation rates along the chain. An affine constraint on\nthese rates is used to model the bounded cellular budget. We show that for a\nhomogeneous constraint the rates that maximize the steady-state protein\nproduction rate have a special structure. They are symmetric with respect to\nthe middle of the chain, and monotonically increase as we move towards the\ncenter of the chain. The ribosomal densities corresponding to the optimal rates\nmonotonically decrease along the chain.

In addition, a new fundamental result, in form\nof a new function called omega $\\Omega(s)$, is introduced to analytic number\ntheory for the first time. This new function together with some of its most\nfundamental properties and other related identities are here disclosed and\npresented as a new approach to the analysis of sums of generalised harmonic\nseries, related alternating series and polygamma functions associated with\nRiemann zeta function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 15:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-13"}
