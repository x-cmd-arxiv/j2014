This paper\naddresses these problems within a unified Bayesian framework for joint\nmulti-object tracking and sensor registration. Given that using standard\nfiltering approaches for state estimation from cameras is problematic, an\nalternative parametrisation is exploited, called disparity space. The disparity\nspace-based approach for triangulation and object tracking is shown to be more\neffective than non-linear versions of the Kalman filter and particle filtering\nfor non-rectified cameras. The approach for feature correspondence is based on\nthe Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter, and hence inherits the ability\nto update without explicit measurement association, to initiate new targets,\nand to discriminate between target and clutter. The PHD filtering approach then\nforms the basis of a camera calibration method from static or moving objects.\nResults are shown on simulated data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2014 17:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-10"}

Considering the simplest possible case where each market\nparticipant has either a positive (bullish) or negative (bearish) sentiment\nwith respect to the market, we model the evolution of the sentiment in the\npopulation due to communication in subgroups of different sizes. Nonlinear\nfeedback effects between the market performance and changes in sentiments are\ntaking into account by assuming that the market performance is dependent on\nchanges in sentiments (e.g. a large sudden positive change in bullishness would\nlead to more buying). The market performance in turn has an impact on the\nsentiment through the transition probabilities to change an opinion in a group\nof a given size. The idea is that if for example the market has observed a\nrecent downturn, it will be easier for even a bearish minority to convince a\nbullish majority to change opinion compared to the case where the meeting takes\nplace in a bullish upturn of the market. Within the framework of our proposed\nmodel, financial markets stylized facts such as volatility clustering and\nextreme events may be perceived as arising due to abrupt sentiment changes via\nongoing communication of the market participants.

Increasing the poleward oceanic heat transport\nresults in an overall increase in the surface temperature and a decrease in the\nequator-to-pole surface temperature difference as a result of the ice-albedo\nfeedback. Following the classical ansatz by Stone, the atmospheric heat\ntransport changes in such a way that the total poleward heat transport remains\nalmost unchanged. We also find that the efficiency of the climate machine, the\nintensity of the Lorenz energy cycle and the material entropy production of the\nsystem decline with increased oceanic heat transport which suggests that the\nclimate system becomes less efficient and turns into a state of reduced entropy\nproduction, as the enhanced oceanic transport performs a stronger large-scale\nmixing between geophysical fluids with different temperature, thus reducing the\navailability in the climate system and bringing it closer to a state of thermal\nequilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2014 18:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

The pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann model [X. Shan and H. Chen, Phys.\nRev. E 49, 2941 (1994)] is a popular mesoscopic model for simulating multiphase\nflows and interfacial dynamics. In this model, the contact angle is usually\nrealized by a fluid-solid interaction. Two widely used fluid-solid\ninteractions: the density-based interaction and the pseudopotential-based\ninteraction, as well as a modified pseudopotential-based interaction formulated\nin the present paper, are numerically investigated and compared in terms of the\nachievable contact angles, the maximum and the minimum densities, and the\nspurious currents. It is found that the pseudopotential-based interaction works\nwell for simulating small static (liquid) contact angles, however, is unable to\nreproduce static contact angles close to 180 degrees. Meanwhile, it is found\nthat the proposed modified pseudopotential-based interaction performs better in\nlight of the maximum and the minimum densities and is overall more suitable for\nsimulating large contact angles as compared with the other two types of\nfluid-solid interactions. Furthermore, the spurious currents are found to be\nenlarged when the fluid-solid interaction force is introduced.

Already at the semiclassical\nlevel, when gravity is a classical background for quantum matter fields, the\naction of gravity should include fourth derivative terms to provide\nrenormalizability in the vacuum sector. The same situation holds in the quantum\ntheory of metric. At the same time, including the fourth derivative terms means\nthe presence of massive ghosts, which are gauge-independent massive states with\nnegative kinetic energy. At both classical and quantum level such ghosts\nviolate stability and hence the theory becomes inconsistent. Several approaches\nto solve this contradiction were invented and we are proposing one more, which\nlooks simpler than those what were considered before. We explore the dynamics\nof the gravitational waves on the background of classical solutions and give\ncertain arguments that massive ghosts produce instability only when they are\npresent as physical particles.

In the energy domain\nbetween 0 and 200 MeV, the integrated strength or depletion number is highly\nsensitive to the separation of the IPM orbit to the scattering continuum. This\nsensitivity is determined by the influence of the surface-absorption properties\nof the DOM self-energy. For an ab initio calculation employing the self-energy\nof the charge-dependent Bonn (CDBonn) interaction which only includes the\neffect of short-range correlations, no such sensitivity is obtained and a\ndepletion of 4% is predicted between 0 and 200 MeV irrespective of the orbit.\nThe ab initio spectral strength generated with the CDBonn interaction\napproaches the empirical DOM spectral strength at 200 MeV. Both spectral\ndistributions allow for an additional 3-5% of the strength at even higher\nenergies which is associated with the influence of short-range correlations. We\nsuggest that the non-local form of the DOM allows for an analysis of\nelastic-nucleon-scattering data that directly determines the depletion of bound\norbits.

To combine the\nadvantages of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and\nmultiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) technologies, we consider a MIMO-OFDM\ncognitive radio network where wireless users with multiple antennas communicate\nover several non-interfering frequency bands. As the network's primary users\n(PUs) come and go in the system, the communication environment changes\nconstantly (and, in many cases, randomly). Accordingly, the network's\nunlicensed, secondary users (SUs) must adapt their transmit profiles \"on the\nfly\" in order to maximize their data rate in a rapidly evolving environment\nover which they have no control. In this dynamic setting, static solution\nconcepts (such as Nash equilibrium) are no longer relevant, so we focus on\ndynamic transmit policies that lead to no regret: specifically, we consider\npolicies that perform at least as well as (and typically outperform) even the\nbest fixed transmit profile in hindsight. Drawing on the method of matrix\nexponential learning and online mirror descent techniques, we derive a\nno-regret transmit policy for the system's SUs which relies only on local\nchannel state information (CSI). Using this method, the system's SUs are able\nto track their individually evolving optimum transmit profiles remarkably well,\neven under rapidly (and randomly) changing conditions. Importantly, the\nproposed augmented exponential learning (AXL) policy leads to no regret even if\nthe SUs' channel measurements are subject to arbitrarily large observation\nerrors (the imperfect CSI case), thus ensuring the method's robustness in the\npresence of uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2014 19:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-10"}

While the core game is the weak prisoner's dilemma, a\nfraction of the population adopts either a positive or a negative value of the\nsucker's payoff, thus playing either the traditional prisoner's dilemma or the\nsnowdrift game. We show that the higher the fraction of the population adopting\na different payoff matrix, the more the evolution of cooperation is promoted.\nThe microscopic mechanism responsible for this outcome is unique to structured\npopulations, and it is due to the payoff heterogeneity, which spontaneously\nintroduces strong cooperative leaders that give rise to an asymmetric strategy\nimitation flow in favor of cooperation.

Additionally, there\nis no evidence for an outflow driven by MM2. The (sub)millimeter spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) of MM2 is best fit with a dust temperature of ~17-19\nK and luminosity of ~5-7 L_sun.

The method\nprovides $direct$ access to the dynamical characteristics of the heating and\nyields the inelastic scattering time $\\tau_{in}$ of 2D electrons.

Since two-dimensional planar structures\npresent obvious advantage for fabrication and integration on chip, the proposed\ncircular polarizer is of great interest in integrated optics and microscopy. It\nprovides a novel scheme to manipulate polarizations of light wave, as well as\nTerahertz wave and microwave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 00:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

The throughput achieved over WiFi channels can be highly variable and\nalso rapidly degrades as the distance from the access point increases. While\nthis behavior is well understood at the data link layer, the interactions\nacross the various protocol layers (data link and up through the transport\nlayer) and the effect of mobility may reduce the amount of content transferred\nto the vehicle, as it travels along the roadway.\n  This paper examines the throughput achieved at the TCP layer over a carefully\ndesigned outdoor WiFi environment and the interactions across the layers that\nimpact the performance achieved, as a function of the receiver mobility. The\nexperimental studies conducted reveal that impairments over the WiFi link\n(frame loss, ARQ and increased delay) and the residual loss seen by TCP causes\na cascade of duplicate ACKs to be generated. This triggers large congestion\nwindow reductions at the sender, leading to a drastic degradation of throughput\nto the vehicular client. To ensure outdoor WiFi infrastructures have the\npotential to sustain reasonable downlink throughput for drive-by vehicles, we\nspeculate that there is a need to adapt how WiFi and TCP (as well as mobility\nprotocols) function for such vehicular applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 02:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

To study their evolution, I\ncorrelated different parameters of the rest-frame narrowband photometry and the\nderived luminosity-weighted mean Single Stellar Population model ages and\nmetallicities.\n  The study finds the member galaxies evolve differently in three different\nsections of the cluster: 1. the region of < 200 kpc hosts passively evolving\nold, massive systems which accumulate mass by dry, minor mergers, 2. the zone\nbetween 200-500 kpc shows stripped systems (or in the process of being gas\nstripped) by ram pressure with moderate star formation history, 3. the outer\nregions (> 500 kpc) show low-mass red objects with blue, star forming\nButcher-Oemler galaxy like colours. This sort of environmental condition is\nknown to harbour hybrid systems, like, the pseudo bulges, blue sequence E/S0\nand Butcher-Oemler like satellite cluster galaxies. Overall, the cluster is\nfound to be poor, quiescent with galaxies to have formed by the monolithic\nstructure formation in the early universe and are now evolving with mergers and\ngas stripping processes by ram pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 08:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

Non-accreting disks are consistent with\nsignificantly lower masses.

We find a strong link between\nfar-IR emission and accretion, and between the inner and outer disk structure.\nHerschel confirms the dichotomy between accreting and non-accreting transition\ndisks. Substantial mass depletion and global evolution need to occur to shut\ndown accretion in a protoplanetary disk, even if the disk has inner holes.\nDisks likely follow different evolutionary paths: Low disk masses do not imply\nopening inner holes, and having inner holes does not require low disk masses.\nThe mini-clusters reveal multi-episodic star formation in Tr37. The long\nsurvival of mini-clusters suggest that they formed from the fragmentation of\nthe same core. Their various morphologies favour different formation/triggering\nmechanisms acting within the same cluster.

These 8 FSRQs belong to the sub-sample of 55\nsources showing the optical--ultraviolet bump interpreted as thermal emission\nfrom a standard accretion disc. Torus luminosities have been estimated for the\neight objects whose torus was identified by the fitting algorithm. For the\nother 47 FSRQs in the sub-sample we have derived upper limits to the torus\nluminosity. Our analysis shows that the torus can show up clearly only under\nquite special conditions: low luminosity and preferentially low peak frequency\nof the beamed synchrotron emission from the jet; high torus luminosity, close\nto that of the accretion disc. This implies that the inferred ratios of torus\nto disc luminosity are biased high.

Conservation of the total photon number\nabove $r_{\\rm sup}$ combined with Compton scattering below the photosphere\nenforces kinetic equilibrium between electrons and photons. This, in turn,\nleads to an increase in the observed photon temperature, which reaches $\\gtrsim\n8$~MeV (observed energy) when decoupling the plasma at the photosphere. This\nresult is weakly dependent on the free model parameters. We show that in this\ncase, the expected thermal luminosity is a few \\% of the total luminosity, and\ncould therefore be detected. The predicted peak energy is more than an order of\nmagnitude higher than the observed peak energy of most GRBs, which puts strong\nconstraints on the magnetization of these outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 10:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Time is\nslotted and multiple users transmit packets (one packet each) simultaneously in\neach timeslot. A sink node aims to decode the messages of all the users from\nthe sequence of receptions over successive timeslots. For each timeslot, the\nNCMA receiver recovers multiple linear combinations of the packets transmitted\nin that timeslot, forming a system of linear equations. Different systems of\nlinear equations are recovered in different timeslots. A message decoder then\nrecovers the original messages of all the users by jointly solving multiple\nsystems of linear equations obtained over different timeslots. We propose a\nlow-complexity digital fountain approach for this coding problem, where each\nsource node encodes its message into a sequence of packets using a fountain\ncode. The aforementioned systems of linear equations recovered by the NCMA\nreceiver effectively couple these fountain codes together. We refer to the\ncoupling of the fountain codes as a linearly-coupled (LC) fountain code. The\nordinary belief propagation (BP) decoding algorithm for conventional fountain\ncodes is not optimal for LC fountain codes. We propose a batched BP decoding\nalgorithm and analyze the convergence of the algorithm for general LC fountain\ncodes. We demonstrate how to optimize the degree distributions and show by\nnumerical results that the achievable rate region is nearly optimal. Our\napproach significantly reduces the decoding complexity compared with the\nprevious NCMA schemes based on Reed-Solomon codes and random linear codes, and\nhence has the potential to increase throughput and decrease delay in\ncomputation-limited NCMA systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 12:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

In\nthe quasielastic peak region the calculations agree with experiment at momentum\ntransfers up to about 0.4 GeV/c while at higher momentum transfers, in the\nregion about 0.4 - 1 GeV/c, a disagreement is seen. In view of this, to\ncalculate the response functions a reference frame was introduced where\ndynamics relativistic corrections are small, and the results pertaining to it\nwere transformed exactly to the laboratory reference frame. This proved to\nremove the major part of the disagreement with experiment. All leading order\nrelativistic corrections to the transition charge operator and to the one--body\npart of the transition current operator were taken into account in the\ncalculations.

The energy source for this turbulence has been much\ndebated with many possible origins proposed. The universality of turbulence,\nits reported large-scale driving, and that it occurs also in starless molecular\nclouds, challenges models invoking any stellar source. A more general process\nis needed to explain the observations. In this work we study the role of\ngalactic spiral arms. This is accomplished by means of three-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations which follow the dynamical evolution of interstellar\ndiffuse clouds (100cm-3) interacting with the gravitational potential field of\nthe spiral pattern. We find that the tidal effects of the arm's potential on\nthe cloud result in internal vorticity, fragmentation and hydrodynamical\ninstabilities. The triggered turbulence result in large-scale driving, on sizes\nof the ISM inhomogeneities, i.e. as large as 100pc, and efficiencies in\nconverting potential energy into turbulence in the range 10 to 25 percent per\narm crossing. This efficiency is much higher than those found in previous\nmodels. The statistics of the turbulence in our simulations are strikingly\nsimilar to the observed power spectrum and Larson scaling relations of\nmolecular clouds and the general ISM. The dependency found from different\nmodels indicate that the ISM turbulence is mainly related to local spiral arm\nproperties, such as its mass density and width. This correlation seems in\nagreement with recent high angular resolution observations of spiral galaxies,\ne.g. M51 and M33.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 13:09:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Second, we use the singular value and its vectors to initialize NMF\nalgorithm. In 2008, Boutsidis and Gollopoulos [3] provided the method titled\nNNDSVD to enhance initialization of NMF algorithms. They extracted the positive\nsection and respective singular triplet information of the unit matrices\n{C(j)}k j=1 which were obtained from singular vector pairs. This strategy aims\nto use positive section to cope with negative elements of the singular vectors,\nbut in experiments we found that even replacing negative elements by their\nabsolute values could get better results than NNDSVD.

In a pseudo-transient\ncontinuation solution of the NPB equation, a long time integration is needed to\nreach the steady state. This calls for time stepping schemes that are stable\nand accurate for large time increments. The existing alternating direction\nimplicit (ADI) methods for the NPB equation are known to be conditionally\nstable, although being fully implicit. To overcome this difficulty, we propose\nseveral new operator splitting schemes, in both multiplicative and additive\nstyles, including locally one-dimensional (LOD) schemes and additive operator\nsplitting (AOS) schemes. The proposed schemes become much more stable than the\nADI methods, and some of them are indeed unconditionally stable in dealing with\nsolvated proteins with source singularities and non-smooth solutions.\nNumerically, the orders of convergence in both space and time are found to be\none. Nevertheless, the precision in calculating the electrostatic free energy\nis low, unless a small time increment is used. Further accuracy improvements\nare thus considered. After acceleration, the optimized LOD method can produce a\nreliable energy estimate by integrating for a small and fixed number of time\nsteps. Since one only needs to solve a tridiagonal linear system in each\nindependent one dimensional process, the overall computation is very efficient.\nThe unconditionally stable LOD method scales linearly with respect to the\nnumber of atoms in the protein studies, and is over 20 times faster than the\nconditionally stable ADI methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 14:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

With\nsimple numerical models, we show that super-Earths can interact with the gas\nthrough dynamical friction to settle in the remote outer regions of a planetary\nsystem.

The main aim is to reduce the\nhardware utilization in a deinterleaver but speed and power consumption are\nimportant parameters which cannot be overlooked.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 06:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

This is done in\nanticipation that large deviations from Benford's law will be found in view of\ntax evasion supposedly being widespread across Italy. Contrary to expectations,\nwe show that the overall tax income data for all these years is in excellent\nagreement with Benford's law. Furthermore, we also analyze the data of\nCalabria, Campania and Sicily, the three Italian regions known for strong\npresence of mafia, to see if there are any marked deviations from Benford's\nlaw. Again, we find that all yearly data sets for Calabria and Sicily agree\nwith Benford's law whereas only the 2007 and 2008 yearly data show departures\nfrom the law for Campania. These results are again surprising in view of\nunderground and illegal nature of economic activities of mafia which\nsignificantly contribute to tax evasion. Some hypothesis for the found\nconformity is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 10:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-10"}

These studies rely on trace-routes and\nalgorithmic inference to resolve individual IP addresses into connected\nrouters, yielding a network of routers. Using WHOIS registries, parsing of DNS\nregistries, as well as simple latency-based triangulation, these routers can\noften be geolocated to at least their country of origin, if not specific\nregions. In this work, we use node subgraph summary statistics to present\nevidence that the router-level (IPv4) network is spatially embedded, with the\nsimilarity (or dissimilarity) of a node from it's neighbor strongly correlating\nwith the attributes of other routers residing in the same country or region. We\ndiscuss these results in context of the recently proposed gravity models of the\nInternet, as well as the potential application to geolocation inferrence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2014 19:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

Here we investigate that the spin force due to spin-orbit coupling,\nwhich in two-dimensional system is equivalent to forces of Hirsch and\nChudnovsky besides constant factors 3 and 3/2 respectively, is a part of\nclassic Anandan force, and that the spin Hall effect is an anomalous Hall\neffect. Furthermore, we develop the method of AC phase to derive the formula\nfor the spin force, and find that the most basic spin Hall effect originates\nfrom the AC phase and is therefore an intrinsic quantum mechanical property of\nspin. This method differs from approach of Berry phase in the study of\nanomalous Hall effect, which is the intrinsic property of the perfect crystal.\nOn the other hand, we use an elegant skill to show that the Chudnovsky-Drude\nmodel is reasonable, and further have improved the theoretical values of spin\nHall conductivity of Chudnovsky. Compared to the theoretical values of spin\nHall conductivity in the Chudnovsky-Drude model, ours are in better agreement\nwith experimentation. Finally, we discuss the relation between spin Hall effect\nand fractional statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 08:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

There\nhas been a growing interest in utilizing alternate architectures, such as low\npower ARM processors, to replace traditional Intel x86 architectures.\nNevertheless, even though such solutions have been successfully used in mobile\napplications with low I/O and memory demands, it is unclear if they are\nsuitable and more energy-efficient in the scientific computing environment.\nFurthermore, there is a lack of tools and experience to derive and compare\npower consumption between the architectures for various workloads, and\neventually to support software optimizations for energy efficiency. To that\nend, we have performed several physical and software-based measurements of\nworkloads from HEP applications running on ARM and Intel architectures, and\ncompare their power consumption and performance.
