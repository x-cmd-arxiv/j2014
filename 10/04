In this\npaper, we propose a probit normal alternative approach to modelling correlated\ntopical structures. Our use of the probit model in the context of topic\ndiscovery is novel, as many authors have so far con- centrated solely of the\nlogistic model partly due to the formidable inefficiency of the multinomial\nprobit model even in the case of very small topical spaces. We herein\ncircumvent the inefficiency of multinomial probit estimation by using an\nadaptation of the diagonal orthant multinomial probit in the topic models\ncontext, resulting in the ability of our topic modelling scheme to handle\ncorpuses with a large number of latent topics. An additional and very important\nbenefit of our method lies in the fact that unlike with the logistic normal\nmodel whose non-conjugacy leads to the need for sophisticated sampling schemes,\nour ap- proach exploits the natural conjugacy inherent in the auxiliary\nformulation of the probit model to achieve greater simplicity. The application\nof our proposed scheme to a well known Associated Press corpus not only helps\ndiscover a large number of meaningful topics but also reveals the capturing of\ncompellingly intuitive correlations among certain topics. Besides, our proposed\napproach lends itself to even further scalability thanks to various existing\nhigh performance algorithms and architectures capable of handling millions of\ndocuments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 16:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-06"}

These models are called\nquasi-periodic cocycles. We make the following assumptions on the model: the\ntranslation vector satisfies a generic Diophantine condition, and the fiber\naction is given by a matrix valued analytic function of several variables which\nis not identically singular. The LDT estimates obtained here depend on some\nuniform measurements on the cocycle.\n  Our general results derived in [9] regarding the continuity properties of the\nLyapunov exponents (LE) and of the Oseledets filtration and decompositions are\nthen applicable, and we obtain local weak-Holder continuity of these quantities\nin the presence of gaps in the Lyapunov spectrum. The main new feature of this\nwork is allowing a cocycle depending on several variables to have\nsingularities, i.e. points of non invertibility. This requires a careful\nanalysis of the set of zeros of certain analytic functions of several variables\nand of the singularities (i.e. negative infinity values) of pluri-subharmonic\nfunctions related to the iterates of the cocycle.\n  A refinement of this method in the one variable case leads to a stronger LDT\nestimate and in turn to a stronger, nearly-Holder modulus of continuity of the\nLE, Oseledets filtration and Oseledets decomposition.\n  This is a draft of a chapter in our forthcoming research monograph [9].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 16:43:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 17:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-13"}

The phenomena of super-resolution are readily apparent in the\nquantum phase representation which also reveals that entanglement is not\nrequired. We modify Schwinger's harmonic oscillator model of angular momentum\nto include the case of photons. Therein the quantum angle measurement is shown\nto be equivalent to the measurement of the relative phase between the two\noscillators. Two reasonable ways of dealing with degeneracy are shown to\ncorrespond to: a conditional measurement which takes a snapshot in absolute\ntime (corresponding to adding probability amplitudes); and a marginal\nmeasurement which takes an average in absolute time (corresponding to adding\nprobabilities). The sense in which distinguishability is a \"matter of how long\nwe look\" is discussed and the meaning of the general theory is illustrated by\ntaking the two oscillators to be circularly polarized photons. It is shown that\nan odd number of x-polarized photons will never have an angle in correspondence\nwith the y-axis; but an even number of x-polarized photons always can! The\nbehavior of an x-polarized coherent state is examined and the snapshot angular\ndistributions are seen to evolve into two counter-rotating peaks resulting in\nconsiderable correspondence with the y-axis at the time for which a classical\nlinear polarization vector would shrink to zero length. We also demonstrate how\nthe probability distribution of absolute time (herein a measurable quantity,\nrather than just a parameter) has an influence on how these snapshot angular\ndistributions evolve into a quantum version of the polarization ellipse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 17:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In this paper, the UA communication techniques are\ndesigned and analyzed based on a geometric model. Specifically, the UA is\nmodeled as a continuous circular/spherical array enclosing target users and\nfree-space propagation is assumed. First, consider the estimation of multiuser\nUA channels induced by user locations. Given single pilot symbols, a novel\nchannel estimation scheme is proposed that decomposes training signals into\nFourier/Laplace series and thereby translates multiuser channel estimation into\npeak detection of a derive function of location. The process is shown to\nsuppress noise. Moreover, it is proved that estimation error due to\ninterference diminishes with the increasing minimum user-separation distance\nfollowing the power law, where the exponent is 1/3 and 1 for the circular and\nspherical UA, respectively. If orthogonal pilot sequences are used, channel\nestimation is found to be perfect. Next, consider channel-conjugate data\ntransmission that maximizes received signal power. The power of interference\nbetween two users is shown to decay with the increasing user-separation\ndistance sub-linearly and super-linearly for the circular and spherical UA,\nrespectively. Furthermore, a novel multiuser precoding design is proposed by\nexciting different phase modes of the UA and controlling the mode weight\nfactors to null interference. The number of available degrees of freedom for\ninterference nulling using the UA is proved to be proportional to the minimum\nuser-separation distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 17:22:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 03:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

We then explore\nthree interesting consequences of this fact. Firstly, since the pure states are\nuncorrelated from the environment, the statement forms a no-go result against\nthe most straightforward device-independent protocol for randomness or secure\nkey generation against general no-signaling adversaries. It also leads to the\ninteresting question whether all non-extremal boxes allow for non-local\ncorrelations with the adversary. Secondly, in addition to the fact that new\ninformation-theoretic principles (designed to pick out the set of quantum\ncorrelations from among all non signaling ones) can in consequence be tested on\narbitrary non-local vertices to check their validity, it also allows the\npossibility of excluding from the quantum set any box of no-signaling\ncorrelations that can be distilled to a non-local vertex. Finally, it also\nforms a sufficient condition to identify non-local games with no quantum\nwinning strategy, when one can show that the game has a single unique\nnon-signaling winning strategy.

In addition, we address a longstanding debate concerning how\nCo substitutions induces superconductivity in the 122 arsenide family, showing\nthat the 3d band filling increases a function of doping. These new microscopic\ninsights into the properties of FBS demonstrate the importance of spin\nfluctuations for the superconducting state, reveal changes in orbital occupancy\namong different families of FBS, and confirm charge doping as one of the\nmechanisms responsible for superconductivity in 122 arsenides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 20:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

We present here a catalog of 92 galaxies from the Atlas3D sample,\nthat are located in low to medium density environments. The observing strategy\nand data reduction pipeline, that achieve a gain of several magnitudes in the\nlimiting surface brightness with respect to classical imaging surveys, are\npresented. The size and depth of the survey is compared to other recent deep\nimaging projects. The paper highlights the capability of LSB--optimized surveys\nat detecting new prominent structures that change the apparent morphology of\ngalaxies. The intrinsic limitations of deep imaging observations are also\ndiscussed, among those, the contamination of the stellar halos of galaxies by\nextended ghost reflections, and the cirrus emission from Galactic dust. The\ndetection and systematic census of fine structures that trace the present and\npast mass assembly of ETGs is one of the prime goals of the project. We provide\nspecific examples of each type of observed structures -- tidal tails, stellar\nstreams and shells --, and explain how they were identified and classified. We\ngive an overview of the initial results. The detailed statistical analysis will\nbe presented in future papers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 21:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Richardson empirically interpreted this super-diffusive\nregime in terms of a non-Fickian process with a scale dependent diffusion\ncoefficient (the celebrated Richardson's \"4/3rd\" law). However, the actual\nphysical mechanism at the origin of such a scale dependent diffusion\ncoefficient remains unclear. The present article proposes a simple physical\nphenomenology for the time evolution of the mean square relative separation in\nturbulent flows, based on a scale dependent ballistic scenario rather than a\nscale dependent diffusive. This phenomenology accurately retrieves most of the\nknown features of relative dispersion ; among others : (i) it is quantitatively\nconsistent with recent numerical simulations and experiments (both for the\nshort term Batchelor regime and the long term Richardson regime, and for all\ninitial separations at inertial scales), (ii) it gives a simple physical\nexplanation of the origin of the super diffusive t^3 Richardson regime which\nnaturally builts itself as an iterative process of elementary\nshort-term-scale-dependent ballistic steps, (iii) it shows that the Richardson\nconstant is directly related to the Kolmogorov constant (and eventually to a\nballistic persistence parameter) and (iv) in a further extension of the\nphenomenology, taking into account third order corrections, it robustly\ndescribes the temporal asymmetry between forward and backward dispersion, with\nan explicit connection to the cascade of energy flux across scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 21:31:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 21:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-26"}

Recent work has shown that the use of hyperspectral DOT data, as\nopposed to data sets comprising of a single or, at most, a dozen wavelengths,\nhas the potential for improving the quality of the reconstructions. The use of\nhyperspectral diffuse optical data in the formulation and solution of the\ninverse problem poses a significant computational burden. The forward operator\nis, in actuality, nonlinear. However, under certain assumptions, a linear\napproximation, called the Born approximation, provides a suitable surrogate for\nthe forward operator, and we assume this to be true in the present work.\nComputation of the Born matrix requires the solution of thousands of large\nscale discrete PDEs and the reconstruction problem, requires matrix-vector\nproducts with the (dense) Born matrix.

The fact that many signals, though high dimensional, are\nintrinsically low dimensional has given the possibility to recover them stably\nfrom a relatively small number of their measurements. For example, in\ncompressed sensing with the standard (synthesis) sparsity prior and in matrix\ncompletion, the number of measurements needed is proportional (up to a\nlogarithmic factor) to the signal's manifold dimension.\n  Recently, a new natural low-dimensional signal model has been proposed: the\ncosparse analysis prior. In the noiseless case, it is possible to recover\nsignals from this model, using a combinatorial search, from a number of\nmeasurements proportional to the signal's manifold dimension. However, if we\nask for stability to noise or an efficient (polynomial complexity) solver, all\nthe existing results demand a number of measurements which is far removed from\nthe manifold dimension, sometimes far greater. Thus, it is natural to ask\nwhether this gap is a deficiency of the theory and the solvers, or if there\nexists a real barrier in recovering the cosparse signals by relying only on\ntheir manifold dimension. Is there an algorithm which, in the presence of\nnoise, can accurately recover a cosparse signal from a number of measurements\nproportional to the manifold dimension? In this work, we prove that there is no\nsuch algorithm. Further, we show through numerical simulations that even in the\nnoiseless case convex relaxations fail when the number of measurements is\ncomparable to the manifold dimension.

When the impact inertia is not\nsufficient, any fingering structure cannot be observed. Contrastively, if the\nimpact inertia is too much, the random splashing is induced and the counting of\nfingers becomes difficult. The clear fingering instability is observable in\nbetween these two regimes. The number of fingers $N$ is counted by using\nhigh-speed video data. The scaling of $N$ is discussed on the basis of\ndimensionless numbers. By assuming Rayleigh-Taylor instability, scaling laws\nfor $N$ can be derived using Reynolds number $Re$, Weber number $We$, and\nFroude number $Fr$. Particularly, the scaling $N=(\\rho_r\nFr)^{1/4}We^{1/2}/3^{3/4}$ is obtained for the gravity-dominant cratering\nregime, where $\\rho_r$ is the density ratio between a projectile and a target.\nAlthough the experimental data considerably scatters, the scaling law is\nconsistent with the global trend of the data behavior.

Facial feature point\ndetection favors many applications such as face recognition, animation,\ntracking, hallucination, expression analysis and 3D face modeling. Existing\nmethods can be categorized into the following four groups: constrained local\nmodel (CLM)-based, active appearance model (AAM)-based, regression-based, and\nother methods. CLM-based methods consist of a shape model and a number of local\nexperts, each of which is utilized to detect a facial feature point. AAM-based\nmethods fit a shape model to an image by minimizing texture synthesis errors.\nRegression-based methods directly learn a mapping function from facial image\nappearance to facial feature points. Besides the above three major categories\nof methods, there are also minor categories of methods which we classify into\nother methods: graphical model-based methods, joint face alignment methods,\nindependent facial feature point detectors, and deep learning-based methods.\nThough significant progress has been made, facial feature point detection is\nlimited in its success by wild and real-world conditions: variations across\nposes, expressions, illuminations, and occlusions. A comparative illustration\nand analysis of representative methods provide us a holistic understanding and\ndeep insight into facial feature point detection, which also motivates us to\nexplore promising future directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Oct 2014 11:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

While advanced dielectric and metallic systems\nhave been developed to tailor the interaction between an emitter and its\nenvironment, active control of the energy flow has remained challenging. Here,\nwe demonstrate in-situ electrical control of the relaxation pathways of excited\nerbium ions, which emit light at the technologically relevant telecommunication\nwavelength of 1.5 $\\mu$m. By placing the erbium at a few nanometres distance\nfrom graphene, we modify the relaxation rate by more than a factor of three,\nand control whether the emitter decays into either electron-hole pairs, emitted\nphotons or graphene near-infrared plasmons, confined to $<$15 nm to the sheet.\nThese capabilities to dictate optical energy transfer processes through\nelectrical control of the local density of optical states constitute a new\nparadigm for active (quantum) photonics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 16:13:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

The question we\naddress is whether a mobile trap can improve capture times over a stationary\ntrap. We consider two scenarios: a randomly moving trap and an oscillating\ntrap. In both cases, we find that a stationary trap actually performs better\n(in terms of reducing expected capture time) than a very slowly moving trap;\nhowever, a trap moving sufficiently fast performs better than a stationary\ntrap. We explicitly compute the thresholds that separate the two regimes. In\naddition, we find a surprising relation between the oscillating trap problem\nand a moving-sink problem that describes reduced dynamics of a single spike in\na certain regime of the Gray-Scott model. Namely, the above-mentioned threshold\ncorresponds precisely to a Hopf bifurcation that induces oscillatory motion in\nthe location of the spike. We use this correspondence to prove the uniqueness\nof the Hopf bifurcation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 16:15:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

It has recently been shown that, despite the\naddition of radially symmetric, linear confining potentials, some specific\nbound-state energies surprisingly retain their exact Dirac--Coulomb values (in\nthe sense of an \"exact symmetry\"). This observation raises pertinent questions\nas to the generality of the cancellation mechanism. A Foldy-Wouthuysen\ntransformation is used to find the relevant nonrelativistic physical degrees of\nfreedom, which include additional spin-orbit couplings induced by the linear\nconfining potentials. The matrix elements of the effective operators obtained\nfrom the scalar, and time-like confining potentials mutually cancel for\nspecific ratios of the prefactors of the effective operators, which must be\ntailored to the cancellation mechanism. The result of the Foldy-Wouthuysen\ntransformation is used to explicitly show that the cancellation is accidental\nand restricted (for a given Hamiltonian) to only one reference state, rather\nthan traceable to a more general relationship among the obtained effective\nlow-energy operators. Furthermore, we show that the cancellation mechanism does\nnot affect anti-particle (negative-energy) states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 20:11:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2015 14:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-09"}

If more realistic models of Hawking radiation are chosen, the\ninformation-geometric structures of the probability space for Hawking radiation\ncan be constructed from some physical considerations. The constructed quantum\nformalism is consistent with both the unitary evolution of Hawking radiation in\nthe semiclassical picture and the topology change of fuzzy horizons.

The design\nengineering of PV systems requires modeling and evaluating shading losses. Some\nPV systems are affected by complex shading scenes whose resulting PV energy\nlosses are very difficult to evaluate with current modeling tools. Several\nspecialized PV design and simulation software include the possibility to\nevaluate shading losses. They generally possess a Graphical User Interface\n(GUI) through which the user can draw a 3D shading scene, and then evaluate its\ncorresponding PV energy losses. The complexity of the objects that these tools\ncan handle is relatively limited. We have created a software solution, 3DPV,\nwhich allows evaluating the energy losses induced by complex 3D scenes on PV\ngenerators. The 3D objects can be imported from specialized 3D modeling\nsoftware or from a 3D object library. The shadows cast by this 3D scene on the\nPV generator are then directly evaluated from the Graphics Processing Unit\n(GPU). Thanks to the recent development of GPUs for the video game industry,\nthe shadows can be evaluated with a very high spatial resolution that reaches\nwell beyond the PV cell level, in very short calculation times. A PV simulation\nmodel then translates the geometrical shading into PV energy output losses.\n3DPV has been implemented using WebGL, which allows it to run directly from a\nWeb browser, without requiring any local installation from the user. This also\nallows taken full benefits from the information already available from\nInternet, such as the 3D object libraries. This contribution describes, step by\nstep, the method that allows 3DPV to evaluate the PV energy losses caused by\ncomplex shading. We then illustrate the results of this methodology to several\napplication cases that are encountered in the world of PV systems design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 22:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}
