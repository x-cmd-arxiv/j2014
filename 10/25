In this context, we\nstudy the following problem of barrier coverage by stationary wireless sensors\nthat are assisted by a mobile robot with the capacity to move sensors. Assume\nthat $n$ sensors are initially arbitrarily distributed on a line segment\nbarrier. Each sensor is said to cover the portion of the barrier that\nintersects with its sensing area. Owing to incorrect initial position, or the\ndeath of some of the sensors, the barrier is not completely covered by the\nsensors. We employ a mobile robot to move the sensors to final positions on the\nbarrier such that barrier coverage is guaranteed. We seek algorithms that\nminimize the length of the robot's trajectory, since this allows the\nrestoration of barrier coverage as soon as possible. We give an optimal\nlinear-time offline algorithm that gives a minimum-length trajectory for a\nrobot that starts at one end of the barrier and achieves the restoration of\nbarrier coverage. We also study two different online models: one in which the\nonline robot does not know the length of the barrier in advance, and the other\nin which the online robot knows the length of the barrier. For the case when\nthe online robot does not know the length of the barrier, we prove a tight\nbound of $3/2$ on the competitive ratio, and we give a tight lower bound of\n$5/4$ on the competitive ratio in the other case. Thus for each case we give an\noptimal online algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2014 16:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-27"}

In tunnel junctions with DyN barrier\nwe obtained $\\sim$37$\\%$ spin polarization of tunneling electrons at 11 K due\nto a small exchange splitting ($ E_{ex}$) $\\approx$5.6 meV of the barrier\nheight ($\\Phi _0$) $\\approx$60 meV. Huge spin-filter efficiency $\\sim$97$\\%$\nwas found for tunnel junctions with GdN barrier due to larger $E_{ex}$\n$\\approx$47 meV. In the presence of an applied magnetic field, barrier height\ncan further split due to magnetic field dependent exchange splitting $\nE_{ex}(H)$. The spin filter efficiency in DyN tunnel junctions can be increased\nup to $\\sim$87$\\%$ with magnetic field. Electric and magnetic field tuned\nspin-filter efficiency of these tunnel junctions gives opportunity for\npractical application of these devices with additional functionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2014 17:09:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 04:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-21"}

To this end, we propose\nan online learning framework for such loss functions.

With\nordering vectors $(\\pi,0)$ or $(0,\\pi)$, this magnetic state breaks the\nhigh-temperature tetragonal symmetry of the system, which is manifested by a\nsplitting of the lattice Bragg peaks. Remarkably, recent experiments in\nhole-doped iron arsenides reported an ordered state that displays magnetic\nBragg peaks at $(\\pi,0)$ and $(0,\\pi)$ but remains tetragonal. Despite being\ninconsistent with a magnetic stripe configuration, this unusual magnetic phase\ncan be described in terms of a double-$\\mathbf{Q}$ magnetic structure\nconsisting of an equal-weight superposition of the ordering vectors $(\\pi,0)$\nand $(0,\\pi)$. Here we show that a non-collinear double-$\\mathbf{Q}$ magnetic\nconfiguration, dubbed \\emph{orthomagnetic}, arises naturally within an\nitinerant three-band microscopic model for the iron pnictides. In particular,\nwe find that strong deviations from perfect nesting and residual interactions\nbetween the electron pockets favor the orthomagnetic over the stripe magnetic\nstate. Using an effective low-energy model, we also calculate the spin-wave\nspectrum of the orthomagnetic state. In contrast to the stripe state, there are\nthree Goldstone modes, manifested in all diagonal and one off-diagonal\ncomponent of the spin-spin correlation function. The total magnetic structure\nfactor displays two anisotropic spin-wave branches emerging from both $(\\pi,0)$\nand $(0,\\pi)$ momenta, in contrast to the case of domains of stripe order,\nwhere only one spin-wave branch emerges from each momentum. We propose that\nthese unique features of the orthomagnetic state can be used to unambiguously\ndistinguish it from the stripe state via neutron scattering experiments, and\ndiscuss the implications of its existence to the nature of the magnetism of the\niron arsenides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2014 19:09:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 22:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-07"}

The paper\nexposes a subset of HPC applications that leverage cluster parallelism using\nMPI, where nodes encounter multiple synchronization points and exhibit\ninter-node dependency. We abstract this structure into a dependency graph, and\nleverage the asymmetry in execution time of parallel jobs on different nodes by\nredistributing power gained from idling a blocked node to nodes that are\nlagging in their jobs. We introduce a solution based on integer linear\nprogramming (ILP) for optimal power distribution algorithm that minimizes total\nexecution time, while maintaining an upper power bound. We then present an\nonline heuristic that dynamically redistributes power at run time.

To understand the effects of power-communication\ncoupling, several have studied interdependent network models and reported that\nincreased coupling can increase system vulnerability. However, these results\ncome from models that have substantially different mechanisms of cascading,\nrelative to those found in actual power and communication networks. This paper\nreports on two sets of experiments that compare the network vulnerability\nimplications resulting from simple topological models and models that more\naccurately capture the dynamics of cascading in power systems. First, we\ncompare a simple model of topological contagion to a model of cascading in\npower systems and find that the power grid shows a much higher level of\nvulnerability, relative to the contagion model. Second, we compare a model of\ntopological cascades in coupled networks to three different physics-based\nmodels of power grids coupled to communication networks. Again, the more\naccurate models suggest very different conclusions. In all but the most extreme\ncase, the physics-based power grid models indicate that increased\npower-communication coupling decreases vulnerability. This is opposite from\nwhat one would conclude from the coupled topological model, in which zero\ncoupling is optimal. Finally, an extreme case in which communication failures\nimmediately cause grid failures, suggests that if systems are poorly designed,\nincreased coupling can be harmful. Together these results suggest design\nstrategies for reducing the risk of cascades in interdependent infrastructure\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2014 20:45:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 21:22:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 19:58:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Taking the nonlocal coupling as a perturbation to the local\ndegrees of freedom, we show that the nonlocality in the self-energy function\ncan be efficiently constructed from the coupling between local fluctuations. It\ncan provide one unified framework to incorporate nonlocality to both ordered\nand disordered correlated many-body fermion systems. In this application, we\nprove that the dual-fermion approach can be understood as a special case of\nthis nonlocal expansion scheme. The scheme presented in this work is\nconstructed without introducing any dual variable, in which the interacting\nnature and the correlated behaviors of the lattice fermions have a clear\nphysics correspondence. Thus, in this special case, the equivalence of the\ndual-fermion approach to the nonlocal expansion scheme beautifully reveals the\nphysics origin of the dual variables. We show that the noninteracting\ndual-fermion Green's function corresponds exactly to a nonlocal coupling of the\nlattice fermion renormalized by the local single-particle charge fluctuations,\nand the dual-fermion self-energy behaves as the one-particle fully irreducible\ncomponents of the lattice Green's function.

In self-reported survey data, subjects recall counts of events\nor behaviors such as the number of sexual partners or the number of drug uses\nin the past three months. Subjects with small counts may report the exact\nnumber, whereas subjects with large counts may have difficulty recalling the\nexact number. Thus, self-reported counts are noisy, and mis-reporting induces\nerrors in the count variable. As a naive method for analyzing self-reported\ncounts, the Poisson random effects model treats the observed counts as true\ncounts and reporting errors in the outcome variable are ignored. Inferences are\ntherefore based on incorrect information and may lead to conclusions\nunsupported by the data. We describe a Bayesian model for analyzing\nlongitudinal self-reported count data that formally accounts for reporting\nerror.

We calculate the quantum\nnoise limited sensitivity curves for the CC-SR design, and find that the\nbroadening of sensitivity predicted by the classical analysis is also present\nin these curves, but is somewhat reduced. Furthermore, we find that the curves\nalways stay above the standard quantum limit. To circumvent this limitation, we\nmodify the dispersion to compensate the non-linear phase variation produced by\nthe optomechanical resonance effects. We find that the upper bound of the\nfactor by which the sensitivity-bandwidth product is increased, compared to the\nhighest-sensitivity result predicted by Bunanno and Chen [Phys. Rev. D 64,\n042006 (2001)], is ~14. We also present a simpler scheme (WLC-SR) where a\ndispersion medium is inserted into the SR cavity. For this scheme, we found the\nupper bound of the enhancement factor to be ~18. We then consider an explicit\nsystem for realizing the NDM, which makes use of five energy levels in\nM-configuration to produce gain, accompanied by electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (the GEIT system).

However, screening for overlapping group lasso remains an open\nchallenge because the overlaps between groups make it infeasible to test each\ngroup independently. In this paper, we develop screening rules for overlapping\ngroup lasso. To address the challenge arising from groups with overlaps, we\ntake into account overlapping groups only if they are inclusive of the group\nbeing tested, and then we derive screening rules, adopting the dual polytope\nprojection approach. This strategy allows us to screen each group independently\nof each other. In our experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of our\nscreening rules on various datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2014 04:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-28"}

To address\nthis task, in recent years three time-resolved measures of spike train\nsynchrony have been proposed, the ISI-distance, the SPIKE-distance, and event\nsynchronization. The Matlab source codes for calculating and visualizing these\nmeasures have been made publicly available.

The process fidelity that can be achieved in a realistic\nimplementation depends on a number of system parameters. Here we experimentally\nexamine Fock-state filtration, a canonical example of a broad class of\nconditional quantum operations acting on a single optical field mode. This\noperation is based upon interference of the mode to be manipulated with an\nauxiliary single-photon state at a beam splitter, resulting in the entanglement\nof the two output modes. A conditional projective measurement onto a single\nphoton at one output mode heralds the success of the process. This operation,\nwhich implements a measurement-induced nonlinearity, is capable of suppressing\nparticular photon-number probability amplitudes of an arbitrary quantum state.\nWe employ coherent-state process tomography to determine the precise operation\nrealized in our experiment. To identify the key sources of experimental\nimperfection, we develop a model of the process and identify three main\ncontributions that significantly hamper its efficacy. The reconstructed tensor\nis compared with a model of the process taking into account sources of\nexperimental imperfection with fidelity better than 0.95. This enables us to\nidentify three key challenges to overcome in realizing a filter with high\nfidelity - namely the single-photon nature of the auxiliary state, high-mode\noverlap, and the need for number resolving detection when heralding. The\nresults show that the filter does indeed exhibit a nonlinear response as a\nfunction of input photon number and preserves the phase relation between Fock\nlayers of the output state, providing promise for future applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2014 13:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The proposed model takes\ninto account as quantile predictors both the lagged values of the estimated\nvolatility and some key macroeconomic and financial variables, which provide\nimportant information about the overall market trend and risk. In this way, and\nwithout distributional assumptions on the realized range innovations, it is\npossible to assess the entire conditional distribution of the estimated\nvolatility.

Under the same\nassumption, the PAs have been dimensioned in a way that maximizes network EE\nnot only for a single time snapshot but over twenty four hours of operation\nwhile considering dynamic efficiency characteristics of the PAs. In order to\nincorporate this daily load profile, each BS has been modeled as an M/G/m/m\nstate dependent queue under the assumption that the network is dimensioned to\nserve a maximum number of users at a time corresponding to 100% cell traffic\nload. This load adaptive system along with the optimized PA dimensioning\nachieves 30% higher energy efficiency compared to a base line system where the\nBSs always run with a fixed number of active antennas which are most energy\nefficient while serving 100% traffic load.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2014 21:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-10"}

A popular observable is the angular\npower spectrum; we present a detailed study applicable to any unbinned source\nskymap S(n) from which N random, independent events are observed. Its exact\nvariance, which is due to the finite statistics, depends only on S(n) and N; we\nalso derive an unbiased estimator of the variance from the data. First-order\neffects agree with previous analytic estimates. Importantly, heretofore\nunidentified higher-order effects are found to contribute to the variance and\nmay cause the uncertainty to be significantly larger than previous analytic\nestimates---potentially orders of magnitude larger. Neglect of these\nhigher-order terms, when significant, may result in a spurious detection of the\npower spectrum. On the other hand, this would indicate the presence of\nhigher-order spatial correlations, such as a large bispectrum, providing new\nclues about the sources. Numerical simulations are shown to support these\nconclusions. Applying the formalism to an ensemble of Gaussian-distributed\nskymaps, the noise-dominated part of the power spectrum uncertainty is\nsignificantly increased at high multipoles by the new, higher-order effects.\nThis work is important for harmonic analyses of the distributions of diffuse\nhigh-energy gamma-rays, neutrinos, and charged cosmic rays, as well as for\npopulations of sparse point sources such as active galactic nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2014 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}
