Also,\nthe known relationship between asymmetric orbifolds and covariant lattices is\nconsidered in the context of our classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 17:09:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Although individual mechanisms such as cellular\ndormancy, angiogenic dormancy and immunosurveillance have been proposed, a\ncomprehensive understanding of cancer dormancy and the \"switch\" from a dormant\nto a proliferative state still needs to be strengthened from both a basic and\nclinical point of view. Computational modeling enables one to explore a variety\nof scenarios for possible but realistic microscopic dormancy mechanisms and\ntheir predicted outcomes. The aim of this paper is to devise such a predictive\ncomputational model of dormancy with an emergent \"switch\" behavior.\nSpecifically, we generalize a previous cellular automaton (CA) model for\nproliferative growth of solid tumor that now incorporates a variety of\ncell-level tumor-host interactions and different mechanisms for tumor dormancy,\nfor example the effects of the immune system. Our new CA rules induce a natural\n\"competition\" between the tumor and tumor suppression factors in the\nmicroenvironment. This competition either results in a \"stalemate\" for a period\nof time in which the tumor either eventually wins (spontaneously emerges) or is\neradicated; or it leads to a situation in which the tumor is eradicated before\nsuch a \"stalemate\" could ever develop. We also predict that if the number of\nactively dividing cells within the proliferative rim of the tumor reaches a\ncritical, yet low level, the dormant tumor has a high probability to resume\nrapid growth. Our findings may shed light on the fundamental understanding of\ncancer dormancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 17:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-20"}

Pairwise\nfringe trackers based on the integrated optics concepts used for example in\nGRAVITY seem limited to about K=10.5 with the 8m Unit Telescopes of the VLTI,\nand there is a general \"common sense\" statement that the efficiency of fringe\ntracking, and hence the sensitivity of optical interferometry, must decrease as\nthe number of apertures increases, at least in the near infrared where we are\nstill limited by detector readout noise. Here we present a Hierarchical Fringe\nTracking (HFT) concept with sensitivity at least equal to this of a two\napertures fringe trackers. HFT is based of the combination of the apertures in\npairs, then in pairs of pairs then in pairs of groups. The key HFT module is a\ndevice that behaves like a spatial filter for two telescopes (2TSF) and\ntransmits all or most of the flux of a cophased pair in a single mode beam. We\ngive an example of such an achromatic 2TSF, based on very broadband dispersed\nfringes analyzed by grids, and show that it allows piston measures from very\nbroadband fringes with only 3 to 5 pixels per fringe tracker. We show the\nresults of numerical simulation indicating that our device is a good achromatic\nspatial filter and allowing a first evaluation of its coupling efficiency,\nwhich is similar to this of a single mode fiber on a single aperture. Our very\npreliminary results indicate that HFT has a good chance to be a serious\ncandidate for the most sensitive fringe tracking with the VLTI and also\ninterferometers with much larger number of apertures. On the VLTI the first\nrough estimate of the magnitude gain with regard to the GRAVITY internal FT is\nbetween 2.5 and 3.5 magnitudes in K, with a decisive impact on the VLTI science\nprogram for AGNs, Young stars and planet forming disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 18:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-20"}

However, reliable communication at these\nfrequencies depends extensively on beamforming with very high-dimensional\nantenna arrays. Estimating the channel sufficiently accurately to perform\nbeamforming can thus be challenging both due to low coherence time and large\nnumber of antennas. Also, the measurements used for channel estimation may need\nto be made with analog beamforming where the receiver can \"look\" in only\ndirection at a time. This work presents a novel method for estimation of the\nreceive-side spatial covariance matrix of a channel from a sequence of power\nmeasurements made at different angular directions. The method reduces the\nspatial covariance estimation to a matrix completion optimization problem. To\nreduce the number of measurements, the optimization can incorporate the\nlow-rank constraints in the channels that are typical in the mmW setting. The\noptimization is convex and fast, iterative methods are presented to solving the\nproblem.

Multifractal analysis is a useful signal and image processing\ntool, yet, the accurate estimation of multifractal parameters for image texture\nremains a challenge. This is due in the main to the fact that current\nestimation procedures consist of performing linear regressions across frequency\nscales of the two-dimensional (2D) dyadic wavelet transform, for which only a\nfew such scales are computable for images. The strongly non-Gaussian nature of\nmultifractal processes, combined with their complicated dependence structure,\nmakes it difficult to develop suitable models for parameter estimation. Here,\nwe propose a Bayesian procedure that addresses the difficulties in the\nestimation of the multifractality parameter. The originality of the procedure\nis threefold: The construction of a generic semi-parametric statistical model\nfor the logarithm of wavelet leaders; the formulation of Bayesian estimators\nthat are associated with this model and the set of parameter values admitted by\nmultifractal theory; the exploitation of a suitable Whittle approximation\nwithin the Bayesian model which enables the otherwise infeasible evaluation of\nthe posterior distribution associated with the model. Performance is assessed\nnumerically for several 2D multifractal processes, for several image sizes and\na large range of process parameters. The procedure yields significant benefits\nover current benchmark estimators in terms of estimation performance and\nability to discriminate between the two most commonly used classes of\nmultifractal process models.

We\ndeconstruct the M-SFR plane by measuring the specific SFR functions in several\nstellar mass bins from z=0.2 out to z=1.4. Our analysis is primary based on a\nMIPS 24$\\mu m$ selected catalogue combining the COSMOS and GOODS surveys. We\nestimate the SFR by combining mid- and far-infrared data for 20500 galaxies.\nThe sSFR functions are derived in four stellar mass bins within the range\n9.5<log(M/Msun)<11.5. First, we demonstrate the importance of taking into\naccount selection effects when studying the M-SFR relation. Secondly, we find a\nmass-dependent evolution of the median sSFR with redshift varying as $sSFR\n\\propto (1+z)^{b}$, with $b$ increasing from $b=2.88$ to $b=3.78$ between\n$M=10^{9.75}Msun$ and $M=10^{11.1}Msun$, respectively. At low masses, this\nevolution is consistent with the cosmological accretion rate and predictions\nfrom semi-analytical models (SAM). This agreement breaks down for more massive\ngalaxies showing the need for a more comprehensive description of the\nstar-formation history in massive galaxies. Third, we obtain that the shape of\nthe sSFR function is invariant with time at z<1.4 but depends on the mass. We\nobserve a broadening of the sSFR function ranging from 0.28 dex at\n$M=10^{9.75}Msun$ to 0.46 dex at $M=10^{11.1}Msun$. Such increase in the\nscatter of the M-SFR relation suggests an increasing diversity of SFHs as the\nstellar mass increases. Finally, we find a gradual decline of the sSFR with\nmass as $log(sSFR) \\propto -0.17M$. We discuss the numerous physical processes,\nas gas exhaustion in hot gas halos or secular evolution, which can gradually\nreduce the sSFR and increase the SFH diversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 21:40:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 11:40:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 08:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-31"}

The extended kagome spin-1/2 antiferromagnet emerges as the\nprimary candidate for hosting both time reversal symmetry (TRS) preserving and\nTRS breaking SLs based on density matrix renormalization group simulations. To\nuncover the nature of the novel quantum phase transition between the SL states,\nwe study a minimum XY model with the nearest neighbor (NN) ($J_{xy}$), the\nsecond and third NN couplings ($J_{2xy}=J_{3xy}=J'_{xy}$). We identify the TRS\nbroken chiral SL (CSL) with the turn on of a small perturbation $J'_{xy}\\sim\n0.06 J_{xy}$, which is fully characterized by the fractionally quantized\ntopological Chern number and the conformal edge spectrum as the $\\nu=1/2$\nfractional quantum Hall state. On the other hand, the NN XY model ($J'_{xy}=0$)\nis shown to be a critical SL state adjacent to the CSL, characterized by the\ngapless spin singlet excitations and also vanishing small spin triplet\nexcitations. The quantum phase transition from the CSL to the gapless critical\nSL is driven by the collapsing of the neutral (spin singlet) excitation gap. By\nfollowing the evolution of entanglement spectrum, we find that the transition\ntakes place through the coupling of the edge states with opposite chiralities,\nwhich merge into the bulk and become gapless neutral excitations. The effect of\nthe NN spin-$z$ coupling $J_z$ is also studied, which leads to a quantum phase\ndiagram with an extended regime for the gapless SL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 22:56:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2014 20:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

The approaches of fast\nlaser process and electrical conductivity matching were used in previous\nliterature, which do not give accurate information on scattering relaxation\ntime as a function of carrier energy for intrinsic photon-free transport.\nGraphene is considered as a model system in materials science studying for its\nsimple atomic and electronic structures. Here we have developed a new\nmethodology to detect the scattering relaxation time as a function of carrier\nenergy, which can be used to infer the carrier scattering mechanisms at\ndifferent temperatures. Our method utilizes the measured values of optimal\nSeebeck coefficient, for both P-type and N-type materials. This new approach\ncan eliminate the influence from photon-carrier scattering in the fast-laser\nmethod, and avoid the over-fitting issue in the electrical conductivity\nmatching method.

Mission-critical\ndevices require such faults to be mitigated by fault-tolerance --- a\ncombination of techniques that aim at preserving the functional behaviour of a\nsystem despite the disruptive effects of transient faults. Fault-tolerance\ntypically has a high deployment cost -- special hardware might be required to\nimplement it -- and provides weak statistical guarantees. It is also based on\nthe assumption that faults are rare. In this paper, we consider scenarios where\nsecurity, rather than functional correctness, is the main asset to be\nprotected. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we develop a theory for\nexpressing confidentiality of data in the presence of transient faults. We show\nthat the natural probabilistic definition of security in the presence of faults\ncan be captured by a possibilistic definition. Furthermore, the possibilistic\ndefinition is implied by a known bisimulation-based property, called Strong\nSecurity. Secondly, we illustrate the utility of these results for a simple\nRISC architecture for which only the code memory and program counter are\nassumed fault-tolerant. We present a type-directed compilation scheme that\nproduces RISC code from a higher-level language for which Strong Security holds\n--- i.e. well-typed programs compile to RISC code which is secure despite\ntransient faults. In contrast with fault-tolerance solutions, our technique\nassumes relatively little special hardware, gives formal guarantees, and works\nin the presence of an active attacker who aggressively targets parts of a\nsystem and induces faults precisely.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2014 08:13:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Oct 2014 17:20:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-28"}

In a conditional distribution modeling, under the SIM\nassumption the conditional law of a response given the covariate vector\ncoincides with the conditional law given a linear combination of the\ncovariates. Several estimation techniques for single-index models are available\nand commonly used in applications.

While they\nfairly well reproduce the local stellar mass functions, correlation functions\nand luminosity functions, they fail to match observations at high redshift (z >\n3) in most cases, particularly in the low-mass range. The inconsistency between\nmodels and observations indicates that the history of gas accretion in\ngalaxies, within their host dark-matter halo, and the transformation of gas\ninto stars, are not well followed. Hereafter, we briefly present a new version\nof the GalICS semi-analytical model. We explore the impacts of classical\nmechanisms, such as supernova feedback or photoionization, on the evolution of\nthe stellar mass assembly. Even with a strong efficiency, these two processes\ncannot explain the observed stellar mass function and star formation rate\ndistribution and some other relations. We thus introduce an ad-hoc modification\nof the standard paradigm, based on the presence of a \\textit{no-star-forming}\ngas component, and a concentration of the star-forming gas in galaxy discs. The\nmain idea behind the existence of the no-star-forming gas reservoir is that\nonly a fraction of the total gas mass in a galaxy is available to form stars.\nThe reservoir generates a delay between the accretion of the gas and the star\nformation process. This new model is in much better agreement with the\nobservations of the stellar mass function in the low-mass range than the\nprevious models, and agrees quite well with a large set of observations,\nincluding the redshift evolution of the specific star formation rate. However,\nit predicts a large fraction of no-star-forming baryonic gas, potentially\nlarger than observed, even if its nature has still to be examined in the\ncontext of the missing baryon problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2014 10:08:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 23:01:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 08:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-25"}

In parallel to this smooth accretion, we\nimplement the standard photoionisation modelling to reduce the input gas flow\non the smallest structures. ii) a complete monitoring of the hot gas phase. We\ncompute the evolution of the core density, the mean temperature and the\ninstantaneous escape fraction of the hot atmosphere by considering that the hot\ngas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in the dark-matter potential well, and by\napplying a principle of conservation of energy on the treatment of gas\naccretion, supernovae and super massive black hole feedback iii) a new\ntreatment for disc instabilities based on the formation, the migration and the\ndisruption of giant clumps. The migration of such clumps in gas-rich galaxies\nallows to form pseudo-bulges. The different processes in the gas cycle act on\ndifferent time scales, and we thus build an adaptive time-step scheme to solve\nthe evolution equations.

How such strong\nmagnetic fields can be generated and maintained is still an unsolved problem,\nwhich is, in principle, related to the interior structure of compact stars,\ni.e., the equation of state of cold matter at supra-nuclear density. In this\npaper we are trying to solve the problem in the regime of solid quark-cluster\nstars. Inside quark-cluster stars, the extremely low ratio of number density of\nelectrons to that of baryons $n_e/n_b$ and the screening effect from\nquark-clusters could reduce the long-range Coulomb interaction between\nelectrons to short-range interaction. In this case, the Stoner's model could\napply, and we find that the condition for ferromagnetism is consistent with\nthat for validity of Stoner's model. Under the screened Coulomb repulsion, the\nelectrons inside the stars could spontaneously magnetized and become\nferromagnetic, and hence would contribute non-zero net magnetic momentum to the\nwhole star. We conclude that, for most cases in solid quark-cluster stars, the\namount of net magnetic momentum, which is proportional to the amount of\nunbalanced spins $\\xi=(n_+-n_-)/n_e$ and depends on the number density of\nelectrons $n_e=n_++n_-$, could be significant with non-zero $\\xi$.

Permuters are used in many signal\nprocessing systems for shuffling data and in communication systems as an\nadjunct to coding for error correction. Typically only a small set of discrete\npermuter lengths are supported. Serial pruning is a simple technique to alter\nthe length of a permutation to support a wider range of lengths, but results in\na serial processing bottleneck. In this paper, parallelizing SPPs is formulated\nin terms of recursively computing sums involving integer floor and related\nfunctions using integer operations, in a fashion analogous to evaluating\nDedekind sums. A mathematical treatment for bit-reversal permutations (BRPs) is\npresented, and closed-form expressions for BRP statistics are derived. It is\nshown that BRP sequences have weak correlation properties. A new statistic\ncalled permutation inliers that characterizes the pruning gap of pruned\ninterleavers is proposed. Using this statistic, a recursive algorithm that\ncomputes the minimum inliers count of a pruned BR interleaver (PBRI) in\nlogarithmic time complexity is presented. This algorithm enables parallelizing\na serial PBRI algorithm by any desired parallelism factor by computing the\npruning gap in lookahead rather than a serial fashion, resulting in significant\nreduction in interleaving latency and memory overhead. Extensions to 2-D block\nand stream interleavers, as well as applications to pruned fast Fourier\ntransforms and LTE turbo interleavers, are also presented. Moreover,\nhardware-efficient architectures for the proposed algorithms are developed.\nSimulation results demonstrate 3 to 4 orders of magnitude improvement in\ninterleaving time compared to existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2014 13:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}

It was shown that generically, without\na phase of accelerated expansion, these alternatives have to break at least one\nof the following tenets of classical general relativity: the Null Energy\nCondition (NEC), subluminal signal propagation, or sub-Planckian energy\ndensities.

Since such\npairs are not broken by the exchange energy of the ferromagnet, superconducting\ntriplet correlations are long-ranged and spin-polarized, with promises for\nsuperconducting spintronics devices. The main challenge is to understand how\ntriplets are generated at the superconductor (S)/ ferromagnet (F) interface.\nHere we use the concept of a so-called triplet spin valve (TSV) to investigate\nthe conversion of singlets in a conventional superconductor to triplets in the\nhalfmetallic ferromagnet CrO_2. TSV's are composed of two ferromagnetic layers\n(separated by a thin normal metal (N) layer) and a superconductor\n(F_1/N/F_2/S). The package F_1/N/F_2 generates triplets in F_1 when the\nmagnetization directions of the F_{1,2}-layers are not collinear. This drains\nsinglet pairs from the S-layer, and triplet generation is therefore signalled\nby a decrease of the critical temperature $T_c$. Recently, experiments with\nTSV's were reported with Co draining layers, using in-plane fields, and finding\nT_c-shifts up to 100~mK. Using CrO_2 instead of Co and rotating a magnetic\nfield from in-plane to out-of-plane, we find strong T_c variations of almost a\nKelvin up to fields of the order of a Tesla. Such strong drainage is consistent\nwith the large lengths over which supercurrents can flow in CrO_2, which are\nsignificantly larger than in conventional ferromagnets. Our results point to\nthe special interest of halfmetals for superconducting spintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2014 15:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}

We find that, due to coarse-graining, the entropy is a monotonic\nincreasing function of the bin width for histogram or bandwidth for kernel\nestimation, which seems to be difficult to select an optimal bin\nwidth/bandwidth for computing the entropy. Fortunately, we notice that there\nexists a minimum of the first derivative of entropy for both histogram and\nkernel estimation, and this minimum point of the first derivative\nasymptotically points to the optimal bin width or bandwidth.

We formalize PP, placing it\nwithin the statistical and probabilistic structure of ruin problems, in which a\nsystem is at risk of total failure, and in place of risk we use a formal\nfragility based approach. We make a central distinction between 1) thin and fat\ntails, 2) Local and systemic risks and place PP in the joint Fat Tails and\nsystemic cases. We discuss the implications for GMOs (compared to Nuclear\nenergy) and show that GMOs represent a public risk of global harm (while harm\nfrom nuclear energy is comparatively limited and better characterized). PP\nshould be used to prescribe severe limits on GMOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 17:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

The model is composed of neural network based agents that evolve\nfitter ideas for actions by (1) inventing new ideas through modification of\nexisting ones, and (2) imitating neighbors' ideas. Numerical simulations\nindicate that the diversity of ideas in a population is positively correlated\nwith both the proportion of creators to imitators in the population, and the\nrate at which creators create. This is the case for both minimum and peak\ndiversity of actions over the duration of a run.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2014 02:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-19"}

It has been widely used to study diffuse synchrotron\nradiation from our Galaxy and as a template to remove foregrounds in cosmic\nmicrowave background data. However, there are a number of issues associated\nwith it that must be dealt with, including large-scale striations and\ncontamination from extragalactic radio sources. We have re-evaluated and\nre-processed the rawest data available to produce a new and improved 408 MHz\nall-sky map. We first quantify the positional accuracy ($\\approx 7$ arcmin) and\neffective beam ($56.0\\pm1.0$ arcmin) of the four individual surveys from which\nit was assembled. Large-scale striations associated with $1/f$ noise in the\nscan direction are reduced to a level $\\ll 1$ K using a Fourier-based filtering\ntechnique. The most important improvement results from the removal of\nextragalactic sources. We have used an iterative combination of two techniques\n-- two-dimensional Gaussian fitting and minimum curvature spline surface\ninpainting -- to remove the brightest sources ($\\gtrsim 2$ Jy), which provides\na significant improvement over previous versions of the map. We quantify the\nimpact with power spectra and a template fitting analysis of foregrounds to the\nWMAP data. The new map is publicly available and is recommended as the template\nof choice for large-scale diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission. We also\nprovide a higher resolution map with small-scale fluctuations added, assuming a\npower-law angular power spectrum down to the pixel scale (1.7 arcmin). This\nshould prove useful in simulations used for studying the feasibility of\ndetecting HI fluctuations from the Epoch of Reionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 20:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 16:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The need\nto certify the information conveyed is a result of known weaknesses in the\nsimple mail transfer protocol (SMTP). The most important consequence of these\nweaknesses is the possibility to mislead the recipient, which is achieved via\nspam (especially email spoofing). Email spoofing refers to alterations in the\nheaders and/or the content of the message. Therefore, the authenticity of the\nmessage is compromised. Unfortunately, the broken link between certification\nand reliability of the information is unsolicited email (spam).\n  Unlike the current practice of estimating the cost of spam, which prompts\norganizations to purchase and maintain appropriate anti-spam software, our\napproach offers an alternative perspective of the economic and moral\nconsequences of unsolicited mail. The financial data provided in this paper\nshow that spam is a major contributor to the financial and production cost of\nan organization, necessitating further attention. Additionally, this paper\nhighlights the importance and severity of the weaknesses of the SMTP protocol,\nwhich can be exploited even with the use of simple applications incorporated\nwithin most commonly used Operating Systems (e.g. Telnet).\n  As a consequence of these drawbacks Mail Distribution Systems need to be\nappropriate configured so as to provide the necessary security services to the\nusers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Oct 2014 15:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
