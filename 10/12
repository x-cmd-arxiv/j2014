We quantify this by mapping out and\ncomparing the regions of parameter space that are excluded by direct detection\nfor the symmetric and asymmetric cases of lepton-flavored dark matter.

As a result, the equilibrium of a game is intimately related to\nthe information available to its players. The \\emph{signaling problem}\nabstracts the task faced by an informed \"market maker\", who must choose how to\nreveal information in order to effect a desirable equilibrium.\n  In this paper, we consider two fundamental signaling problems: one for\nabstract normal form games, and the other for single item auctions. For the\nformer, we consider an abstract class of objective functions which includes the\nsocial welfare and weighted combinations of players' utilities, and for the\nlatter we restrict our attention to the social welfare objective and to\nsignaling schemes which are constrained in the number of signals used. For both\nproblems, we design approximation algorithms for the signaling problem which\nrun in quasi-polynomial time under various conditions, extending and\ncomplementing the results of various recent works on the topic.\n  Underlying each of our results is a \"meshing scheme\" which effectively\novercomes the \"curse of dimensionality\" and discretizes the space of\n\"essentially different\" posterior beliefs -- in the sense of inducing\n\"essentially different\" equilibria. This is combined with an algorithm for\noptimally assembling a signaling scheme as a convex combination of such\nbeliefs. For the normal form game setting, the meshing scheme leads to a convex\npartition of the space of posterior beliefs and this assembly procedure is\nreduced to a linear program, and in the auction setting the assembly procedure\nis reduced to submodular function maximization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Oct 2014 23:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

Though appealing in its simplicity, this\nmodel is quite suspect in practice. A wide variety of factors including\nexternalities and budgets have been studied that can and do cause it to be\nviolated. In this paper we adopt a view of GSP as an iterated second price\nauction (see, e.g., Milgrom 2010) and study how the most basic violation of\nseparability --- position dependent, arbitrary public click-through-rates that\ndo not decompose --- affects results from the foundational analysis of GSP\n(Varian 2007, Edelman et al. 2007). For the two-slot setting we prove that for\narbitrary click-through-rates, for arbitrary bidder values, an efficient\npure-strategy equilibrium always exists; however, without separability there\nalways exist values such that the VCG outcome and payments cannot be realized\nby any bids, in equilibrium or otherwise. The separability assumption is\ntherefore necessary in the two-slot case to match the payments of VCG but not\nfor efficiency. We moreover show that without separability, generic existence\nof efficient equilibria is sensitive to the choice of tie-breaking rule, and\nwhen there are more than two slots, no (bid-independent) tie-breaking rule\nyields the positive result. In light of this we suggest alternative mechanisms\nthat trade the simplicity of GSP for better equilibrium properties when there\nare three or more slots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Oct 2014 04:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

These DM parameters are\nhigher for more luminous systems of early types with red colour and low gas\ncontent. We also found that the correlation of DM parameters with colour index\nappears to be the manifestation of a stronger relation between DM halo mass and\nthe colour of a galaxy.

As these systems appear naturally in\nengineering problems, time-subcycling techniques are widely used every day to\nimprove computational efficiency. These methods rely on a decomposition of the\nvector field in a fast part and a slow part and take advantage of that\ndecomposition. This way, if an unconditionnally stable (semi-)implicit scheme\ncannot be easily implemented, one can integrate the fast equations with a much\nsmaller time step than that of the slow equations, instead of having to\nintegrate the whole system with a very small time-step to ensure stability.\nThen, one can build a numerical integrator using a standard composition method,\nsuch as a Lie or a Strang formula for example. Such methods are primarily\ndesigned to be convergent in short-time to the solution of the original\nproblems. However, their longtime behavior rises interesting questions, the\nanswers to which are not very well known. In particular, when the solutions of\nthe problems converge in time to an asymptotic equilibrium state, the question\nof the asymptotic accuracy of the numerical longtime limit of the schemes as\nwell as that of the rate of convergence is certainly of interest. In this\ncontext, the asymptotic error is defined as the difference between the exact\nand numerical asymptotic states.

In particular, distributed remote\nradio heads (RRHs/antennas) are connected to a central processor (CP) via\ncapacity-limited backhaul links to facilitate joint transmission. The RRHs and\nthe CP are equipped with renewable energy harvesters and share their energies\nvia a lossy micropower grid for improving the efficiency in conveying\ninformation and green energy to mobile receivers via radio frequency (RF)\nsignals. The considered resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a\nmixed non-convex and combinatorial optimization problem taking into account the\nlimited backhaul capacity and the quality of service requirements for\nsimultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). We aim at\nminimizing the total network transmit power when only imperfect channel state\ninformation of the wireless energy harvesting receivers, which have to be\npowered by the wireless network, is available at the CP. In light of the\nintractability of the problem, we reformulate it as an optimization problem\nwith binary selection, which facilitates the design of an iterative resource\nallocation algorithm to solve the problem optimally using the generalized\nBender's decomposition (GBD). Furthermore, a suboptimal algorithm is proposed\nto strike a balance between computational complexity and system performance.\nSimulation results illustrate that the proposed GBD based algorithm obtains the\nglobal optimal solution and the suboptimal algorithm achieves a\nclose-to-optimal performance. Besides, the distributed antenna network for\nSWIPT with renewable energy sharing is shown to require a lower transmit power\ncompared to a traditional system with multiple co-located antennas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Oct 2014 08:10:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 08:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-12"}

As in the Earth oceans, it\ncorresponds to the resonant excitation of their eigenmodes of oscillation and\ntheir damping. Therefore, it strongly depends on the internal structure,\nrotation, and dissipative mechanisms in each component. In this work, we\npresent a local analytical modeling of tidal gravito-inertial waves excited in\nstellar convective and radiative regions respectively. This model allows us to\nunderstand in details the properties of the resonant tidal dissipation as a\nfunction of the excitation frequencies, the rotation, the stratification, and\nthe viscous and thermal properties of the studied fluid regions. Then, the\nfrequencies, height, width at half-height, and number of resonances as well as\nthe non-resonant equilibrium tide are derived analytically in asymptotic\nregimes that are relevant in stellar interiors. Finally, we demonstrate how\nviscous dissipation of tidal waves leads to a strongly erratic orbital\nevolution in the case of a coplanar binary system. We characterize such a\nnon-regular dynamics as a function of the height and width of resonances, which\nhave been previously characterized thanks to our local fluid model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Oct 2014 15:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Witnessing the continuous\ndevelopment of heterogeneity in datacenters, we are confronted with their\ndifferent behaviors in terms of performance, power consumption and thermal\ndissipation: Indeed, heterogeneity at server level lies both in the computing\ninfrastructure (computing power, electrical power consumption) and in the heat\nremoval systems (different enclosure, fans, thermal sinks). Also the physical\nlocations of the servers become important with heterogeneity since some servers\ncan (over)heat others. While many studies address independently these\nparameters (most of the time performance and power or energy), we show in this\npaper the necessity to tackle all these aspects for an optimal resource\nmanagement of the computing resources. This leads to improved energy usage in a\nheterogeneous datacenter including the cooling of the computer rooms. We build\nour approach on the concept of heat distribution matrix to handle the mutual\ninfluence of the servers, in heterogeneous environments, which is novel in this\ncontext. We propose a heuristic to solve the server placement problem and we\ndesign a generic greedy framework for the online scheduling problem. We derive\nseveral single-objective heuristics (for performance, energy, cooling) and a\nnovel fuzzy-based priority mechanism to handle their tradeoffs. Finally, we\nshow results using extensive simulations fed with actual measurements on\nheterogeneous servers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Oct 2014 15:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

We study the Laplace\noperator $\\Delta^{|df|^2}$ of the flat singular Riemannian manifold\n$(X,|df|^2)$. We define a regularized determinant for $\\Delta^{|df|^2}$ and\nstudy it as a functional on the Hurwitz space. We prove that this functional is\nrelated to a system of PDE which admits explicit integration. This leads to an\nexplicit expression for the determinant of the Laplace operator in terms of the\nbasic objects on the underlying Riemann surface (the prime form,\ntheta-functions, the canonical meromorphic bidifferential) and the divisor of\nthe meromorphic differential $df$. The proof has several parts that can be of\nindependent interest. As an important intermediate result we prove a\ndecomposition formula of the type of Burghelea-Friedlander-Kappeler for the\ndeterminant of the Laplace operator on flat surfaces with conical singularities\nand Euclidean or conical ends. We introduce and study the $S$-matrix,\n$S(\\lambda)$, of a surface with conical singularities as a function of the\nspectral parameter $\\lambda$ and relate its behavior at $\\lambda=0$ with the\nSchiffer projective connection on the Riemann surface $X$.
