This is a theoretical counterparty risk\nmitigation mechanism that allows the counterparty of a general OTC contract to\nswitch from zero to full/perfect collateralization and switch back whenever she\nwants until contract maturity paying some switching costs and taking into\naccount the running costs that emerge over time. In this paper we allow for the\nstrategic interaction between the counterparties of the underlying contract,\nwhich makes the problem solution much more tough. We are motivated in this\nresearch by the importance to show the economic sense - in terms of optimal\ncontract design - of a contingent counterparty risk mitigation mechanism like\nour one. In particular, we show that the existence of the solution and the game\nNash equilibrium is connected with the solution of a system of non-linear\nreflected BSDE which remains an open problem. We then provide the basic ideas\nto numerically search the game equilibrium via an iterative optimal stopping\napproach and we show the existence of the solution for our problem under strong\ncondition, in the so called symmetric case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 16:02:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2014 10:24:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 13:45:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-12"}

Ultraviolet radiation plays a crucial role in molecular clouds.\nRadiation and matter are tightly coupled and their interplay influences the\nphysical and chemical properties of gas. In particular, modeling the radiation\npropagation requires calculating column densities, which can be numerically\nexpensive in high-resolution multidimensional simulations. Aims. Developing\nfast methods for estimating column densities is mandatory if we are interested\nin the dynamical influence of the radiative transfer. In particular, we focus\non the effect of the UV screening on the dynamics and on the statistical\nproperties of molecular clouds. Methods. We have developed a tree-based method\nfor a fast estimate of column densities, implemented in the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code RAMSES. We performed numerical simulations using this method in\norder to analyze the influence of the screening on the clump formation.\nResults. We find that the accuracy for the extinction of the tree-based method\nis better than 10%, while the relative error for the column density can be much\nmore. We describe the implementation of a method based on precalculating the\ngeometrical terms that noticeably reduces the calculation time. To study the\ninfluence of the screening on the statistical properties of molecular clouds we\npresent the probability distribution function (PDF) of gas and the associated\ntemperature per density bin and the mass spectra for different density\nthresholds. Conclusions. The tree-based method is fast and accurate enough to\nbe used during numerical simulations since no communication is needed between\nCPUs when using a fully threaded tree. It is then suitable to parallel\ncomputing. We show that the screening for far UV radiation mainly affects the\ndense gas, thereby favoring low temperatures and affecting the fragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 17:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

It is\ndemonstrated that the techniques yield Lax- or S-integrable NLPDEs with both\ntime- AND space-dependent coefficients which are thus more general than almost\nall cases considered earlier via other methods such as the Painleve Test, Bell\nPolynomials, and various similarity methods.

We solve the\ntime dependent radiative transfer equation for the specific intensities to\naccurately calculate the angular distribution of the emitted radiation.\nTurbulence generated by the magneto-rotational instability provides\nself-consistent angular momentum transfer. The simulation reaches inflow\nequilibrium with an accretion rate ~220L_edd/c^2 and forms a radiation driven\noutflow along the rotation axis. The mechanical energy flux carried by the\noutflow is ~20% of the radiative energy flux. The total mass flux lost in the\noutflow is about 29% of the net accretion rate. The radiative luminosity of\nthis flow is ~10L_edd. This yields a radiative efficiency ~4.5%, which is\ncomparable to the value in a standard thin disk model. In our simulation,\nvertical advection of radiation caused by magnetic buoyancy transports energy\nfaster than photon diffusion, allowing a significant fraction of the photons to\nescape from the surface of the disk before being advected into the black hole.\nWe contrast our results with the lower radiative efficiencies inferred in most\nmodels, such as the slim disk model, which neglect vertical advection. Our\ninferred radiative efficiencies also exceed published results from previous\nglobal numerical simulations, which did not attribute a significant role to\nvertical advection.

Observations were made between\nAugust and December 2013, at a frequency of 8.4 GHz. These observations\nrepresent the first epoch of a VLBA monitoring campaign on these blazars, and\nthey significantly increase the fraction of TeV HBLs studied with\nhigh-resolution imaging. The peak VLBI flux densities of these sources range\nfrom about 10 to 100 mJy/beam, and parsec-scale jet structure is detected in\nall sources. About half of the VLBI cores are resolved, with brightness\ntemperature upper limits of a few times 10^10 K, and we find that a brightness\ntemperature of about 2x10^10 K is consistent with the VLBI data for all but one\nof the sources. Such brightness temperatures do not require any relativistic\nbeaming to reduce the observed value below commonly invoked intrinsic limits;\nhowever, the lack of detection of counter-jets does place a modest limit on the\nbulk Lorentz factor of greater than about 2. These data are thus consistent\nwith a picture where weak-jet sources like the TeV HBLs develop significant\nvelocity structures on parsec-scales. We also extend consideration to the full\nsample of TeV HBLs by combining the new VLBI data with VLBI and gamma-ray data\nfrom the literature. By comparing measured VLBI and TeV fluxes to samples with\nintrinsically uncorrelated luminosities generated by Monte Carlo simulations,\nwe find a marginally significant correlation between the VLBI and TeV fluxes\nfor the full TeV HBL sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 23:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The ionic strength of the electrolyte that suspends\ncharged colloids is widely used to control the physical properties of colloidal\nsuspensions. The extensively used two-body Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek\n(DLVO) approach allows for a quantitative analysis of the effective\nelectrostatic forces between colloidal particles. DLVO relates the ionic\ndouble-layers, which enclose the particles, to their effective electrostatic\nrepulsion. Nevertheless, the double layer is distorted at high macroion volume\nfractions. Therefore, DLVO cannot describe the many-body effects that arise in\nconcentrated suspensions. We show that this problem can be largely resolved by\nidentifying effective point charges for the macroions using cell theory. This\nextrapolated point charge (EPC) method assigns effective point charges in a\nconsistent way, taking into account the excluded volume of highly charged\nmacroions at any concentration, and thereby naturally accounting for high\nvolume fractions in both salt-free and added-salt conditions. We provide an\nanalytical expression for the effective pair potential and validate the EPC\nmethod by comparing molecular dynamics simulations of macroions and monovalent\nmicroions that interact via Coulombic potentials to simulations of macroions\ninteracting via the derived EPC effective potential. The simulations reproduce\nthe macroion-macroion spatial correlation and the virial pressure obtained with\nthe EPC model.

We model neutron stars with realistic equations of\nstate (notably through piecewise polytropic equations of state). Using these\nquasiequilibrium sequences we compute the binary's scalar charge and binding\nenergy versus orbital angular frequency. We find that the absolute value of the\nbinding energy is smaller than in general relativity (GR), differing at most by\n~14% at high frequencies for the cases considered. We use the newly computed\nbinding energy and the balance equation to estimate the number of\ngravitational-wave (GW) cycles during the adiabatic, quasicircular inspiral\nstage up to the end of the sequence, which is the last stable orbit or the\nmass-shedding point, depending on which comes first. We find that, depending on\nthe ST parameters, the number of GW cycles can be substantially smaller than in\nGR. In particular, we obtain that when dynamical scalarization sets in around a\nGW frequency of ~130 Hz, the sole inclusion of the ST binding energy causes a\nreduction of GW cycles from ~120 Hz up to the end of the sequence (~1200 Hz) of\n~11% with respect to the GR case. We estimate that when the ST energy flux is\nalso included the reduction in GW cycles becomes of ~24%. Quite interestingly,\ndynamical scalarization can produce a difference in the number of GW cycles\nwith respect to the GR point-particle case that is much larger than the effect\ndue to tidal interactions, which is on the order of only a few GW cycles.

Also, we have extended\nour result to the non-elementary polyomino and hexagonal system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 03:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-06"}

Such curvature in the gamma-ray spectrum of 1H 0323+342 and PMN\nJ0948+0022 can be due to emission region located inside the broad line region\n(BLR) where the primary mechanism of the gamma-ray emission is inverse-Compton\n(IC) scattering of BLR photons occurring in the Klein-Nishina regime. The\ngamma-ray emission of SBS 0846+513 is explained by IC scattering of dusty torus\nphotons which puts the emission region to be outside the BLR and thus under the\nThomson regime. Therefore, the observed curvature of SBS 0846+513 could be\nintrinsic to the particle energy distribution. The presence of curvature in the\ngamma-ray spectrum and flux variability amplitudes of some of the RL-NLSy1\ngalaxies suggest that these sources could be akin to low/moderate jet power\nflat spectrum radio quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 05:58:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

A BCI can decode\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) signals of brain activities, and then send a command\nor an intent to an external interactive device, such as a wheelchair. The\neffectiveness of the BCI depends on the performance in decoding the EEG.\nUsually, the EEG is contaminated by different kinds of artefacts (e.g.,\nelectromyogram (EMG), background activity), which leads to a low decoding\nperformance. A number of filtering methods can be utilized to remove or weaken\nthe effects of artefacts, but they generally fail when the EEG contains extreme\nartefacts. In such cases, the most common approach is to discard the whole data\nsegment containing extreme artefacts.

We\nmake use of a forward-backward predictor based on autoregressive moving average\nmodelling (ARMA) in the time domain. The method MIARMA is particularly suitable\nfor replacing invalid data such as those present in the light curves of the\nCoRoT satellite due to the pass through the South Atlantic Anomaly, and\neventually for the data gathered by the NASA planet hunter Kepler. We select a\nsample of stars from the ultra-precise photometry collected by the\nasteroseismic camera on board the CoRoT satellite: the {\\delta} Scuti star HD\n174966, showing periodic variations of the same order as the CoRoT\nobservational window, the Be star HD 51193, showing longer time variations, and\nthe solar-like HD 49933, with rapid time variations. We showed that in some\ncases linear interpolations are less reliable to what was believed. In\nparticular: the power spectrum of HD 174966 is clearly aliased when this\ninterpolation is used for filling the gaps; the light curve of HD 51193\npresents a much more aliased spectrum than expected for a low frequency\nharmonic signal; and finally, although the linear interpolation does not affect\nnoticeably the power spectrum of the CoRoT light curve of the solar-like star\nHD 49933, the ARMA interpolation showed rapid variations previously\nunidentified that ARMA interprets as a signal. In any case, the ARMA\ninterpolation method provides a cleaner power spectrum, that is, less\ncontaminated by spurious frequencies. In conclusion, MIARMA appears to be a\nsuitable method for filling gaps in the light curves of pulsating stars\nobserved by CoRoT since the method preserves their frequency content, which is\na necessary condition for asteroseismic studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 13:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

Here, using a model cyanine dye, Cy3, we\ndemonstrate that brightness and photostability of the dye is significantly\naltered when trapped in a molecular container, e.g. cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n])\nand cyclodextrins (CD).Through computational modeling, we predicted that Cy3\nforms a stable inclusion complex with three different hosts, CB[7], beta-CD,\nand methyl-beta-CD, which was further confirmed by single-molecule diffusion\nmeasurements using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The effect of\nsupramolecular encapsulation on Cy3 photophysical properties was found to be\nhighly host-specific. Up to three-fold increase in brightness of Cy3 was\nobserved when the dye was trapped in methyl-beta-CD, due to an increase in both\ndye absorption and quantum yield. Steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy\nof the various complexes revealed that host polarizability and restricted\nmobility of the dye in the host both contribute to the observed increase in\nmolecular brightness. Furthermore, entrapment of the dye molecule in CDs\nresulted in a marked increase in dye photostability, whereas the dye degraded\nmore rapidly in CB[7]. These results suggest that the changes in photophysical\nproperties of the dye afforded by supramolecular encapsulation are highly\ndependent on the host molecule. The reported improvement in brightness and\nphotostability together with the excellent biocompatibility of cyclodextrins\nmakes supramolecular encapsulation a viable strategy for routine dye\nenhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 18:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-06"}

Some form of vehicle-to-vehicle and/or\nvehicle-to-infrastructure cooperation is required to ensure a safe and\nefficient global transportation system. This thesis deals with a particular\nform of cooperation by studying the problem of coordinating multiple mobile\nrobots at an intersection area. Most of coordination systems proposed in\nprevious work consist in planning a trajectory and to control the robots along\nthe planned trajectory: that is the plan-as-program paradigm where planning is\nconsidered as a generative mechanism of action. The approach of the thesis is\nto plan priorities -- the relative order of robots to go through the\nintersection -- which is much weaker as many trajectories respect the same\npriorities. More precisely, priorities encode the homotopy classes of solutions\nto the coordination problem. Priority assignment is equivalent to the choice of\nsome homotopy class to solve the coordination problem instead of a particular\ntrajectory. Once priorities are assigned, robots are controlled through a\ncontrol law preserving the assigned priorities, i.e., ensuring the described\ntrajectory belongs to the chosen homotopy class. It results in a more robust\ncoordination system -- able to handle a large class of unexpected events in a\nreactive manner -- particularly well adapted for an application to the\ncoordination of autonomous vehicles at intersections where cars, public\ntransport and pedestrians share the road.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 15:24:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-06"}

For the absolute orientation of the\nelectric vector position angles (EVPA) we used the D-terms method. We also used\ngamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope on weekly time bins\nthroughout 2011. The source shows polarized emission, and its properties vary\nwith time, frequency, and location along the jet. The core mean polarization\nfraction is generally between 1% and 2%, with a 4% peak at 43 GHz in March; the\npolarization angle is variable, mainly at 15 GHz, where it changes frequently,\nand less so at 43 GHz, where it oscillates in the range 114 - 173 deg. The jet\npolarization properties are more stable, with a fractional polarization of\naround 16% and a polarization angle nearly perpendicular to the jet axis. The\naverage flux and photon index at gamma-ray energies are (17.7+-0.5)x10^8 ph\ncm^-2 s^-1 and the photon index is 1.77+-0.02.

We show that the de Sitter accelerated expansion\nof the FLRW space with no matter fields (hereinafter, empty space) is its\nnatural state, and the model does not require either a scalar field or\ncosmological constant or any other hypotheses. This is due to the fact that the\nde Sitter state is an exact solution of the rigorous mathematically consistent\nequations of one-loop quantum gravity for the empty FLRW space that are finite\noff the mass shell. Space without matter fields is not empty, as it always has\nthe natural quantum fluctuations of the metric, i.e. gravitons. Therefore, the\nempty (in this sense) space is filled with gravitons, which have the\nbackreaction effect on its evolution over time forming a self-consistent de\nSitter instanton leading to the exponentially accelerated expansion of the\nUniverse. At the start and the end of cosmological evolution, the Universe is\nassumed to be empty, which explains the origin of inflation and dark energy.\nThis scenario leads to the prediction that the signs of the parameter 1+w\nshould be opposite in both cases, and this fact is consistent with\nobservations. The fluctuations of the number of gravitons lead to fluctuations\nof their energy density which in turn leads to the observed CMB temperature\nanisotropy of the order of 10^-5 and CMB polarization. In the frame of this\nscenario, it is not a hypothetical scalar field that generates inflation and\nrelic gravitational waves but on the contrary, the gravitational waves\n(gravitons) generate dark energy, inflation, CMB anisotropy and polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 15:55:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Dec 2014 21:19:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2015 21:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

The ultrafast energy relaxation in graphene occurs through two\ncompeting pathways: carrier-carrier scattering -- creating an elevated carrier\ntemperature -- and optical phonon emission. At present, it is not clear what\ndetermines the dominating relaxation pathway. Here we reach a unifying picture\nof the ultrafast energy relaxation by investigating the terahertz\nphotoconductivity, while varying the Fermi energy, photon energy, and fluence\nover a wide range. We find that sufficiently low fluence ($\\lesssim$ 4\n$\\mu$J/cm$^2$) in conjunction with sufficiently high Fermi energy ($\\gtrsim$\n0.1 eV) gives rise to energy relaxation that is dominated by carrier-carrier\nscattering, which leads to efficient carrier heating. Upon increasing the\nfluence or decreasing the Fermi energy, the carrier heating efficiency\ndecreases, presumably due to energy relaxation that becomes increasingly\ndominated by phonon emission. Carrier heating through carrier-carrier\nscattering accounts for the negative photoconductivity for doped graphene\nobserved at terahertz frequencies. We present a simple model that reproduces\nthe data for a wide range of Fermi levels and excitation energies, and allows\nus to qualitatively assess how the branching ratio between the two distinct\nrelaxation pathways depends on excitation fluence and Fermi energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 12:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-27"}
