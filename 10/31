That agent uses opinions\nas freely selectable strategies to get control on the dynamics: The strategic\nagent of our benchmark problem tries, during a campaign of a certain length, to\ninfluence the ongoing dynamics among normal agents with strategically placed\nopinions (one per period) in such a way, that, by the end of the campaign, as\nmuch as possible normals end up with opinions in a certain interval of the\nopinion space.

In the limit of large driving\nfrequency, the long-time dynamics of such systems can often be described by a\ntime-independent effective Hamiltonian, which is generally identified through a\nperturbative treatment. Here, we present a general formalism that describes\ntime-modulated physical systems, in which the driving frequency is large, but\nresonant with respect to energy spacings inherent to the system at rest. Such a\nsituation is currently exploited in optical-lattice setups, where superlattice\n(or Wannier-Stark-ladder) potentials are resonantly modulated so as to control\nthe tunneling matrix elements between lattice sites, offering a powerful method\nto generate artificial fluxes for cold-atom systems. The formalism developed in\nthis work identifies the basic ingredients needed to generate interesting flux\npatterns and band structures using resonant modulations. Additionally, our\napproach allows for a simple description of the micro-motion underlying the\ndynamics; we illustrate its characteristics based on diverse dynamic-lattice\nconfigurations. It is shown that the impact of the micro-motion on physical\nobservables strongly depends on the implemented scheme, suggesting that a\ntheoretical description in terms of the effective Hamiltonian alone is\ngenerally not sufficient to capture the full time-evolution of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 16:20:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 15:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

We study the evolution and saturation behaviour of two types of\nBaker's map dynamos, which have been used to model Zeldovich's STF dynamo\nprocess. Using such maps allows one to analyze dynamos at much higher magnetic\nReynolds numbers $R_M$ as compared to direct numerical simulations. In the\n2-strip map dynamo there is constant constructive folding while the 4-strip map\ndynamo also allows the possibility of field reversal. Incorporating a diffusive\nstep parameterised by $R_M$, we find that the magnetic field $B(x)$ is\namplified only above a critical $R_M=R_{crit} \\sim 4$ for both types of\ndynamos. We explore the saturation of these dynamos in 3 ways; by a\nrenormalized decrease of the effective $R_M$ (Case I) or due to a decrease in\nthe efficiency of field amplification by stretching (Case II), or a combination\nof both effects (Case III). For Case I, we show that $B(x)$ in the saturated\nstate, for both types of maps, goes back to the marginal eigenfunction, which\nis obtained for the critical $R_M=R_{crit}$. This is independent of the initial\n$R_M=R_{M0}$. On the other hand in Case II, for the 2-strip map, we show that\n$B(x)$ now saturates preserving the structure of the kinematic eigenfunction.\nThus the energy is transferred to larger scales in Case I but remains at the\nsmallest resistive scales in Case II. For the 4-strip map, the $B(x)$\noscillates with time, although with a structure similar to the kinematic\neigenfunction. Interestingly, the saturated state for Case III shows an\nintermediate behaviour, with $B(x)$ now similar to the kinematic eigenfunction\nfor an intermediate $R_M=R_{sat}$, with $R_{M0}>R_{sat}>R_{crit}$.

This variation is\ngoverned by the underlying temperature-density structure of the solar\natmosphere. To explore the spectrally resolved center-to-limb variation (CLV)\nwe make use of two spectral atlases recorded with the Fourier transform\nspectrometer (FTS) at the McMath-Pierce facility at Kitt Peak. One spectral\natlas obtained 10 arcsec inside the solar limb was recorded in 1978-79 as part\nof the first survey of the Second Solar Spectrum, while the other atlas is the\nwell used reference NSO/Kitt Peak FTS atlas for the disk center. Both atlases\nrepresent fully resolved spectra without any spectral stray light. We then\nconstruct an atlas of the limb/disk-center ratio between the two spectra over\nthe wavelength range 4084-9950 \\AA. This ratio spectrum, which expresses the\nCLV amplitude relative to the continuum, is as richly structured as the\nintensity spectrum itself, but the line profiles differ greatly in both shape\nand amplitude. It is as if we are dealing with a new, unfamiliar spectrum of\nthe Sun, distinctly different from both the intensity spectrum (which we here\nrefer to with the acronym SS1) and the linear polarization of the Second Solar\nSpectrum (for which we use acronym SS2). In analogy we refer to the new ratio\nspectrum as SS3.

This\nnon-linear mapping is successfully modeled in terms of two free parameters that\nare found to vary approximately linearly over the entire wavelength range\ncovered.

Natural\nfrom this point of view are matrices provided by the modular transformations of\nconformal blocks (with the usual identification R=T and U=S), and in the\nsimplest case of the first degenerate field (2,1), when the conformal blocks\nsatisfy a second order Shroedinger-like equation, the invariants coincide with\nthe Jones (N=2) invariants of the associated knots. Another possibility to\nconstruct knot invariants is to realize the cluster coordinates associated with\nreshufflings of the Stokes lines immediately in terms of check-operators acting\non the solutions to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations.

However, in the Milky Way the first -and so far- only clear case of\nrelativistic jets inducing star formation has been found in the surroundings of\nthe microquasar GRS 1915+105. Here we summarize the multiwavelength\nobservations of two compact star formation IRAS sources axisymmetrically\nlocated and aligned with the position angle of the sub-arcsec relativistic jets\nfrom the stellar black hole binary GRS 1915+105 (Mirabel & Rodriguez 1994).

Recently,\nReid et al.(2014) found that the jet source and the IRAS sources are at the\nsame distance, enhancing the evidence for the physical association between the\njets from GRS 1915+105 and star formation in the IRAS sources. We conclude that\nas jets from AGN, jets from microquasars can trigger the formation of massive\nstars, but at distances of a few tens of parsecs. Although star formation\ninduced by microquasar jets may not be statistically significant in the Milky\nWay, jets from stellar black holes may have been important to trigger star\nformation during the re-ionization epoch of the universe (Mirabel et al. 2011).\nBecause of the relative proximity of GRS 1915+105 and the associated star\nforming regions, they may serve as a nearby laboratory to gain insight into the\nphysics of jet-trigger star formation elsewhere in the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 18:55:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 18:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The use of squeezing has been\nproposed as a way to reduce the quantum noise without increasing the laser\npower, and has been successfully tested at one of the LIGO sites and at GEO in\nGermany. When used in Advanced LIGO without a filter cavity, the squeezer\nimproves the performances of detectors above about 100 Hz, at the cost of a\nhigher noise floor in the low frequency regime. Frequency-dependent squeezing,\non the other hand, will lower the noise floor throughout the entire band.\nSqueezing technology will have a twofold impact: it will change the number of\nexpected detections and it will impact the quality of parameter estimation for\nthe detected signals. In this work we consider three different GW detector\nnetworks, each utilizing a different type of squeezer, all corresponding to\nplausible implementations. Using LALInference, a powerful Monte Carlo parameter\nestimation algorithm, we study how each of these networks estimates the\nparameters of GW signals emitted by compact binary systems, and compare the\nresults with a baseline advanced LIGO-Virgo network. We find that, even in its\nsimplest implementation, squeezing has a large positive impact: the sky error\narea of detected signals will shrink by about 30% on average, increasing the\nchances of finding an electromagnetic counterpart to the GW detection.\nSimilarly, we find that the measurability of tidal deformability parameters for\nneutron stars in binaries increases by about 30%, which could aid in\ndetermining the equation of state of neutron stars. The degradation in the\nmeasurement of the chirp mass, as a result of the higher low-frequency noise,\nis shown to be negligible when compared to systematic errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 19:24:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 22:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-24"}

We find that in adiabatic runs the\nartificial conductivity favours (i) the formation of an entropy core, raising\nand flattening the central entropy profiles, in better agreement with findings\nfrom Eulerian codes; and (ii) a systematic reduction of the cold gas component.\nIn fact, the cluster large-scale structure and dynamical state are preserved\nacross different runs, but the improved gas mixing enabled by the AC term\nstrongly increases the stripping rate of gas from the cold clumps moving\nthrough the ICM.

One is a double spin-chain\nformulation of the spin-chain and the associated new interpretation of the\noperation of Wick contraction. It will be regarded as a skew symmetric pairing\nwhich acts as a projection onto a singlet in the entire SO(4) sector, instead\nof an inner product in the spin-chain Hilbert space. This formalism allows us\nto study a class of three-point functions of operators built upon more general\nspin-chain vacua than the special configuration discussed so far in the\nliterature. Furthermore, this new viewpoint has the signicant advantage over\nthe conventional method: In the usual \"tailoring\" operation, the Wick\ncontraction produces inner products between off-shell Bethe states, which\ncannot be in general converted into simple expressions. In contrast, our\nprocedure directly produces the so-called partial domain wall partition\nfunctions, which can be expressed as determinants. Using this property, we\nderive simple determinantal representation for a broader class of three-point\nfunctions. The second new property uncovered in this work is the non-trivial\nidentity satisfied by the three-point functions with monodromy operators\ninserted. Generically this relation connects three-point functions of different\noperators and can be regarded as a kind of Schwinger-Dyson equation. In\nparticular, this identity reduces in the semiclassical limit to the triviality\nof the product of local monodromies around the vertex operators, which played a\ncrucial role in providing all important global information on the three-point\nfunction in the strong coupling regime. This structure may provide a key to the\nunderstanding of the notion of \"integrability\" beyond the spectral level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 20:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 03:26:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 16:08:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

First, their kinematics as a function of\nage from stellar evolution modeling (isochrone fitting) is very different from\nthat of normal stars. Second, while X-ray luminosity of normal stars declines\nwith age, the X-ray luminosity of overluminous F stars changes in the opposite\ndirection, being on average higher for older stars. These properties imply\nthat, in defiance of standard models of stellar evolution, F stars of a given\nmass and chemical composition can evolve very differently. Assuming that the\nmodels correctly describe normal stars, for overluminous F stars they predict\ntoo young age and the X-ray emission evolving in the direction opposite to the\nactually observed trend. This discrepancy between modeling results and\nobservational data suggests that standard stellar evolution models and models\nof stellar activity are missing some important factors, which makes stellar age\nand predictions for stellar activity from these models problematic.

To that extend, we present\na comprehensive survey of the impact of different realizations of the fermion\nsectors on the Higgs potential, with a special emphasis on the role of the\nleptons. The non-negligible compositeness of the $\\tau_R$ in a general class of\nmodels that address the flavor structure of the lepton sector and the smallness\nof the corresponding FCNCs, can have a significant effect on the potential. We\nfind that, with the $\\tau_R$ in the symmetric representation of $SO(5)$, an\nincrease in the maximally allowed mass of the lightest top partner of $\\gtrsim\n1$ TeV is possible for minimal quark setups like the MCHM$_{5,10}$, without\nincreasing the tuning. A light Higgs boson $m_H \\sim(100-200)$ GeV is a natural\nprediction of such models, which thus provide a new setup that can evade\nultra-light top partners without ad-hoc tuning in the Higgs mass. Moreover, we\nadvocate a more minimal realization of the lepton sector than generally used in\nthe literature, which still can avoid light partners due to its contributions\nto the Higgs mass in a different and very natural way, triggered by the seesaw\nmechanism. This allows to construct the most economical $SO(5)/SO(4)$ composite\nHiggs models possible. Using both a transparent 4D approach, as well as\npresenting numerical results in the 5D holographic description, we demonstrate\nthat, including leptons, minimality and naturalness do not imply light\npartners. Leptonic effects, not considered before, could hence be crucial for\nthe viability of composite models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 21:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 15:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

Our work\nexplores a variety of techniques for leakage-resilient, fault-tolerant error\ncorrection in the context of topological codes. Our contributions are\nthreefold.

In the summer of 2014, there was great uncertainty\nabout the answers to several key policy questions concerning the path to\ncontainment. In recent years, epidemic models have been used to guide public\nhealth interventions. But, model-based policy relies on high quality causal\nunderstanding of transmission, including the availability of appropriate\ndynamic transmission models and reliable reporting about the sequence of case\nincidence for model fitting, which were lacking for this epidemic. To\ninvestigate the range of potential transmission scenarios, we developed a\nmulti-type branching process model that incorporates key heterogeneities and\ntime-varying parameters to reflect changing human behavior and deliberate\ninterventions. Ensembles of this model were evaluated at a set of parameters\nthat were both epidemiologically plausible and capable of reproducing the\nobserved trajectory. Results suggest that epidemic outcome depends on both\nhospital capacity and individual behavior. The model predicts that if hospital\ncapacity is not increased soon, then transmission may outpace the rate of\nisolation and the ability to provide care for the ill, infectious, and dying.\nSimilarly, containment will probably require individuals to adopt behaviors\nthat increase the rates of case identification and isolation and secure burial\nof the deceased. Given current knowledge, it is uncertain that this epidemic\nwill be contained even with 99% hospitalization rate at the currently projected\nhospital capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 21:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-03"}

The\nobservations are incompatible with an origin of the activity by impact or by\nthe sublimation of entrapped ice. This object appears to be shedding its\nregolith by rotational (presumably YORP-driven) instability. Long-term fading\nof the photometry (months) is attributed to gradual dissipation of near-nucleus\ndust. Photometric variations on short timescales ($<$0.7 hr) are probably\ncaused by fast rotation of the nucleus. However, because of limited time\ncoverage and dilution of the nucleus signal by near-nucleus dust, we have not\nbeen able to determine the rotation period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 21:52:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 19:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

It is previously shown that (Yildirim,\n2015, Int. J. Mod. Phys A, 30(7), 1550034), topologically massive Yang-Mills\ntheory exhibits a Chern-Simons splitting behavior at large scales, similar to\nthe topologically massive AdS gravity model in its near Chern-Simons limit.\nThis splitting occurs as two Chern-Simons parts with levels $+k/2$ each, where\n$k$ is the original Chern-Simons level in the Lagrangian. In the pure\nChern-Simons limit, split parts combine to give the original Chern-Simons\nlevel. The opposite limit of the gravitational analogue gives an\nEinstein-Hilbert term with a negative cosmological constant, which can be\nwritten as a two half Chern-Simons terms with opposite signs. With this\nmotivation, the gauge theory analogue of this limit is investigated, showing\nthat at finite large distances pure Yang-Mills theory acts like a topological\ntheory that consists of split Chern-Simons parts with levels $+k/2$ and $-k/2$.\nAt very large distances these split terms cancel, making the Yang-Mills theory\ntrivial, as expected, due to the existence of a mass gap. Gauge invariance of\nthe split parts is discussed. It is also shown that this splitting behavior can\nbe exploited to incorporate link invariants of knot theory, just like in the\ntopologically massive case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 00:10:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 04:18:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Feb 2018 02:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-13"}

We have\ninvestigated orbital evolution in a formation scenario for such planets, based\non core accretion model: i) Icy cores accrete from planetesimals at $\\lesssim$\n30AU, ii) they are scattered outward by an emerging nearby gas giant to acquire\nhighly eccentric orbits, and iii) their orbits are circularized through\naccretion of disk gas in outer regions, where they spend most of time. We\nanalytically derived equations to describe the orbital circularization through\nthe gas accretion. Numerical integrations of these equations show that the\neccentricity decreases by a factor of more than 5 during the planetary mass\nincreases by a factor of 10. Because runaway gas accretion increases planetary\nmass by $\\sim$ 10--300, the orbits are sufficiently circularized. On the other\nhand, $a$ is reduced at most only by a factor of 2, leaving the planets in\nouter regions. If the relative velocity damping by shock is considered, the\ncircularization is slowed down, but still efficient enough. Therefore, this\nscenario potentially accounts for the formation of observed distant jupiters in\nnearly circular orbits. If the apocenter distances of the scattered cores are\nlarger than the disk sizes, their $a$ shrink to a quarter of the disk sizes;\nthe $a$-distribution of distant giants could reflect outer edges of the disks\nin a similar way that those of hot jupiters may reflect inner edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 07:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Magnetic\nreconnection occurs in strong current layers which have very short length\nscales. The aim of this work is to explore the nature of current layers around\nseparators. A separator is a special field line which lies along the\nintersection of two separatrix surfaces and forms the boundary between four\ntopologically distinct flux domains. In particular, here the current layer\nabout a separator that joins two 3D nulls and lies along the intersection of\ntheir separatrix surfaces is investigated. A magnetic configuration containing\na single separator embedded in a uniform plasma with a uniform electric current\nparallel to the separator is considered. This initial magnetic setup, which is\nnot in equilibrium, relaxes in a non-resistive manner to form an equilibrium.\nThe relaxation is achieved using the 3D MHD code, Lare3d, with resistivity set\nto zero. A series of experiments with varying initial current are run to\ninvestigate the characteristics of the resulting current layers present in the\nfinal (quasi-) equilibrium states. In each experiment, the separator collapses\nand a current layer forms along it. The dimensions and strength of the current\nlayer increase with initial current. It is found that separator current layers\nformed from current parallel to the separator are twisted.

As a precursor for\ncrystal formation, we observe increased local order at the position where the\ncrystal will form, but no correlations with the local density. Thus, the\nnucleation is driven by order fluctuations rather than density fluctuations.\nOur results also show that the transition involves two stages in both cases,\nfirst a transition liquid-bcc, followed by a bcc-hcp/fcc transition. Both\ntransitions have to overcome free energy barriers, so that a spherical bcc-like\ncluster is formed first, in which the final fcc-like structure is nucleated\nmainly at the surface of the crystallite. This means that the bcc-fcc phase\ntransition is a heterogeneous nucleation, even though we start from a\nhomogeneous bulk liquid. The height of the bcc-hcp/fcc free energy barrier\nstrongly depends on the contact energies of the colloids. For low contact\nenergy this barrier is low, so that the bcc-hcp/fcc transition happens\nspontaneously. For the higher contact energy, the second barrier is too high to\nbe crossed spontaneously by the colloidal system. However, it was possible to\nratchet the system over the second barrier and to transform the bcc nuclei into\nthe stable hcp/fcc phase.

An initial destabilization of a filament results in\nstretching out of magnetic threads belonging to its body and rooted in the\nphotosphere along the inversion line. Their reconnection leads to i) heating of\nparts of the filament or its environment, ii) initial development of the flare\narcade cusp and ribbons, and iii) increasing similarity of the filament to a\ncurved flux rope and its acceleration. Then the pre-eruption arcade enveloping\nthe filament gets involved in reconnection according to the standard model and\ncontinues to form the flare arcade and ribbons. The poloidal magnetic flux in\nthe curved rope developing from the filament progressively increases and forces\nits toroidal expansion. This flux rope impulsively expands and produces an MHD\ndisturbance, which rapidly steepens into a shock. The shock passes through the\narcade expanding above the filament and then freely propagates ahead of the CME\nlike a decelerating blast wave for some time. If the CME is slow, then the\nshock eventually decays. Otherwise, the frontal part of the shock changes into\nthe bow-shock regime. This was observed for the first time in the 24 February\n2011 event. When reconnection ceases, the flux rope relaxes and constitutes the\nCME core-cavity system. The expanding arcade develops into the CME frontal\nstructure. We also found that reconnection in the current sheet of a remote\nstreamer forced by the shock's passage results in a running flare-like process\nwithin the streamer responsible for a type II burst.

Inverse Ising inference is a method to distinguish one from the other.\nEssentially, the parameters of the least constrained statistical model are\nlearned from the observed correlations such that direct interactions can be\nseparated from indirect correlations. Among many other applications, this\napproach has been helpful for protein structure prediction, because residues\nwhich interact in the 3D structure often show correlated substitutions in a\nmultiple sequence alignment. In this context, samples used for inference are\nnot independent but share an evolutionary history on a phylogenetic tree. Here,\nwe discuss the effects of correlations between samples on global inference.\nSuch correlations could arise due to phylogeny but also via other slow\ndynamical processes. We present a simple analytical model to address the\nresulting inference biases, and develop an exact method accounting for\nbackground correlations in alignment data by combining phylogenetic modeling\nwith an adaptive cluster expansion algorithm. We find that popular reweighting\nschemes are only marginally effective at removing phylogenetic bias, suggest a\nrescaling strategy that yields better results, and provide evidence that our\nconclusions carry over to the frequently used mean-field approach to the\ninverse Ising problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 11:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

Key parameters are the mixing processes, the\nmetallicity, the mass-loss rate and the effect of a close companion. We study\nhow the red supergiant lifetimes, the tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram\n(HRD), the positions in this diagram of the pre-supernova progenitor as well as\nthe structure of the stars at that time change for various mass-loss rates\nduring the red supergiant phase (RSG), and for two different initial rotation\nvelocities. The surface abundances of RSGs are much more sensitive to rotation\nthan to the mass-loss rates during that phase. A change of the RSG mass-loss\nrate has a strong impact on the RSG lifetimes and therefore on the luminosity\nfunction of RSGs. At solar metallicity, the enhanced mass-loss rate models do\nproduce significant changes on the populations of blue, yellow and red\nsupergiants. When extended blue loops or blue ward excursions are produced by\nenhanced mass-loss, the models predict that a majority of blue (yellow)\nsupergiants are post RSG objects. These post RSG stars are predicted to show\nmuch smaller surface rotational velocities than similar blue supergiants on\ntheir first crossing of the HR gap. The position in the HRD of the end point of\nthe evolution depends on the mass of the hydrogen envelope. More precisely,\nwhenever, at the pre-supernova stage, the H-rich envelope contains more than\nabout 5\\% of the initial mass, the star is a red supergiant, and whenever the\nH-rich envelope contains less than 1\\% of the total mass the star is a blue\nsupergiant. For intermediate situations, intermediate colors/effective\ntemperatures are obtained. Yellow progenitors for core collapse supernovae can\nbe explained by the enhanced mass-loss rate models, while the red progenitors\nare better fitted by the standard mass-loss rate models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 12:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-25"}

The aim of the present work is the investigation in-vitro of the\nfluid dynamic modifications occurring as a consequence of the morphological\nchanges typically induced in the aortic root by MS. A mock-loop reproducing the\nleft ventricle outflow tract and the aortic root was used to measure time\nresolved velocity maps on a longitudinal symmetry plane of the aortic root. Two\ndilated model aortas, designed to resemble morphological characteristics\ntypically observed in MS patients, have been compared to a reference, healthy\ngeometry. The aortic model was designed to quantitatively reproduce the change\nof aortic distensibility caused by MS.

Changes in expression of a gene propagate to other\ngenes along paths in the network. At a stable state, the system's Jacobian\nmatrix confers information about network connectivity. To disclose the\nfunctional properties of genes, knowledge of network connections is essential.\nWe present a new method to reconstruct the Jacobian matrix of models for gene\nregulatory systems from equilibrium protein concentrations. In a recent paper\nwe defined propagation and feedback functions describing how genetic variation\nat one gene propagates to the other genes in the network and possibly also back\nto itself. Here we show how propagation and feedback functions provide\nrelations between equilibrium protein levels which are in principle observable,\nand Jacobi elements which are not directly observable. We establish exact\nformulae expressing the Jacobian in terms of derivatives of propagation and\nfeedback functions. Approximating these derivatives from perturbed and\nunperturbed protein levels, we derive formulae for estimating the Jacobian. We\napply the method to models of the Drosophila segment polarity network and\nrandomly generated gene networks. Genes could be perturbed in two ways: by\nmodifying mRNA degradation rates, or by allele knockout in diploid models.\nComparison with the true Jacobians shows that for noiseless data we obtain hit\nrates close to 100% in the former case and in the range 80-90% in the latter.\nOur method adds to the network interference toolbox and provides a sign\nestimate of the Jacobian from steady state data, and a value estimate of the\nJacobian if protein degradation rates are known. Also the approach identifies\nsome predicted connections as much more reliable than others, and could point\nto further experiments for resolving uncertainties in the less dependable\nJacobian elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 15:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-03"}

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) often\ndoes not protect against knee OA development. Accordingly, a multiscale\nformulation for Data Driven Prognosis (DDP) of post ACLR is developed. Unlike\ntraditional predictive strategies that require controlled off-line measurements\nor training for determination of constitutive parameters to derive the\ntransitional statistics, the proposed DDP algorithm relies solely on in situ\nmeasurements. The proposed DDP scheme is capable of predicting onset of\ninstabilities. Since the need for off line testing (or training) is obviated,\nit can be easily implemented for ACLR, where such controlled a priori testing\nis almost impossible to conduct. The DDP algorithm facilitates hierarchical\nhandling of the large data set, and can assess the state of recovery in post\nACLR conditions based on data collected from stair ascent and descent exercises\nof subjects. The DDP algorithm identifies inefficient knee varus motion and\nknee rotation as primary difficulties experienced by some of the post ACLR\npopulation. In such cases, levels of energy dissipation rate at the knee, and\nits fluctuation may be used as measures for assessing progress after ACL\nreconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 22:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

The most popular estimation\ntechnique in the VG-integration literature is `hindcast', in which the historic\njoint distribution of demand and available VG is used as a predictive\ndistribution. Through the use of bootstrap statistical analysis, this paper\nwill show that due to extreme sparsity of data on times of high demand and low\nVG, hindcast results can suffer from sampling uncertainty to the extent that\nthey have little practical meaning. An alternative estimation approach, in\nwhich a marginal distribution of available VG is rescaled according to demand\nlevel, is thus proposed.
