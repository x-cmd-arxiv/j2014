In order\nto reach even higher resolutions before the advent of future high-energy\ncolliders, it is necessary to consider indirect probes of New Physics (NP), a\nprime example being Delta F=2 neutral meson mixing processes, which are\nsensitive to much shorter distance scales. However Delta F=2 processes alone\ncannot tell us much about the structure of NP beyond the LHC scales. To\nidentify for instance the presence of new quark flavour-changing dynamics of a\nleft-handed (LH) or right-handed (RH) nature, complementary results from Delta\nF=1 rare decay processes are vital. We therefore address the important question\nof whether NP could be seen up to energy scales as high as 200 TeV,\ncorresponding to distances as small as 10^{-21}m -- the Zeptouniverse -- in\nrare K and B_{s,d} decays, subject to present Delta F=2 constraints and\nperturbativity. We focus in particular on a heavy Z' gauge boson. If restricted\nto purely LH or RH Z' couplings to quarks, we find that rare K decays, in\nparticular KL-> pi^0 nu nubar and K^+->pi^+ nu nubar, allow us to probe the\nZeptouniverse. On the other hand rare B_s and B_d decays, which receive\nstronger Delta F=2 constraints, allow us to reach about 15 TeV. Allowing for\nboth LH and RH couplings a loosening of the Delta F=2 constraints is possible,\nand we find that the maximal values of M_Z' at which NP effects that are\nconsistent with perturbative couplings could be found are approximately 2000\nTeV for K decays and 160 TeV for rare B_{s,d} decays. Finally we present a\nsimple idea for an indirect determination of M_Z' that could be realised at the\nnext linear e^+e^- or mu^+ mu^- collider and with future precise flavour data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2014 16:03:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 09:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-18"}

Our\nextensive dataset spans two years, and complemented with Spitzer mid-infrared\n(MIR) data, we use it to build an optical-to-MIR bolometric lightcurve between\ndays 3 and 732. To model the bolometric lightcurve before day 400 we use a grid\nof hydrodynamical SN models and a bolometric correction determined with\nsteady-state NLTE modelling.

Oxygen nucleosynthesis depends sensitively\non the main-sequence mass of the star and modeling of the [O I] 6300, 6364\nlines constrains the progenitors of these three SNe to the M_ZAMS=12-16 M_sun\nrange (ejected oxygen masses 0.3-0.9 M_sun), with SN 2011dh towards the lower\nend and SN 1993J towards the upper end of the range.

Taking the radial variation in\nother equilibrium profiles (e.g safety factor q(x)) into account, removes the\nstationary point in ${\\Omega_0(x, p)}$ and results in a mode that peaks\nslightly away from the outboard mid-plane with a reduced global growth rate.\nFinally, the influence of flow shear has also been investigated through a\nDoppler shift, ${\\omega_0 \\rightarrow \\omega_0 + n\\Omega^{\\prime}x}$, where n\nis the toroidal mode number and ${\\Omega^{\\prime}}$ incorporates the effect of\nflow shear. The equilibrium profile variation introduces an asymmetry to the\ngrowth rate spectrum with respect to the sign of ${\\Omega^{\\prime}}$,\nconsistent with recent global gyrokinetic calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2014 16:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-05"}

Within FGM, the messenger sector\ncouples directly to the MSSM matter fields with couplings controlled by the\nsame dynamics that explains the hierarchies in the SM Yukawas. Although the\npattern of flavor violation depends on the particular underlying flavor model,\nFGM provides a built-in flavor suppression similar to wave function\nrenormalization or SUSY Partial Compositeness. Moreover, in contrast to these\nmodels, there is an additional suppression of left-right (LR) flavor\ntransitions by third-generation Yukawas that in particular provides an extra\nprotection against flavor-blind phases. We exploit the consequences of this\nsetup for lepton flavor phenomenology, assuming that the new couplings are\ncontrolled by simple U(1) flavor models that have been proposed to accommodate\nlarge neutrino mixing angles. Remarkably, it turns out that in the context of\nFGM these models can pass the impressive constraints from LFV processes and\nleptonic EDMs even for light superpartners, therefore offering the possibility\nof resolving the longstanding muon g-2 anomaly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2014 18:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-31"}

This connection comes from\nup-regulation of glycolysis by tumor cells, which can lead to active\ncompetition for resources in the tumor microenvironment between tumor and\nimmune cells. Here it is further proposed that cancer stem cells (CSCs) can\ncircumvent the anti-tumor immune response by creating a 'protective shield' of\nnon-stem cancer cells around them. This shield can protect the CSCs both by\ncreating a physical barrier between them and cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs), and\nby promoting competition for the common resources, such as glucose, between\nnon-stem cancer cells and CTLs. The implications of this hypothesis are\ninvestigate using an agent-based model, leading to a prediction that relative\nCSC to non-CSC ratio will vary with the strength of the host immune response,\nwith the highest occurring at an intermediate state of immune activation. A\ndiscussion of possible therapeutic approaches concludes the paper, suggesting\nthat a chemotherapeutic regimen consisting of regular pulsed doses, i.e.,\nmetronomic chemotherapy, would yield the best clinical outcome by allowing CTLs\nto most effectively reach and eliminate CSCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2014 18:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-05"}

We show that these are best fitted by a\nmodel of a single string with a quark at one endpoint and a diquark at the\nother. This model is preferred over the Y-shaped string model with a quark at\neach endpoint. We show how the model follows from a stringy model of the\nholographic baryon which includes a baryonic vertex connected with N_c strings\nto flavor probe branes. From fitting to baryonic data we find that there is no\nclear evidence for a non-zero baryonic vertex mass, but if there is such a mass\nit should be located at one of the string endpoints. The available baryon\ntrajectories in the angular momentum plane (J,M^2), involving light, strange,\nand charmed baryons, are rather well fitted when adding masses to the string\nendpoints, with a single universal slope of 0.95 GeV^-2.

We compute, for the signal and background reactions, angular and\nenergy correlations of the charged prongs and analyze which type of cuts\nsuppress the Drell-Yan background. An important feature of this background is\nthat its contribution to the distribution of our observable is a flat line,\nalso at NLO QCD. By separating the Drell-Yan events into two different sets,\ntwo different non-trivial distributions are obtained. Based on this observation\nwe propose to use these sets for calibation purposes. By Monte Carlo simulation\nwe study also the effect of measurement uncertainties on this distribution. We\nestimate that the Higgs mixing angle can be determined with our method to a\nprecision of 14 degree (5 degree) at the high luminosity LHC (14 TeV) with an\nintegrated luminosity of 500 inverse fb (3 inverse ab).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2014 20:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 14:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-11"}

The\nturbulent viscosity is modeled by the $\\alpha$-ansatz, with different equations\nof state. We consider both discs with transonic radial inflows across the\ninnermost stable circular orbit, and stationary discs truncated by a reflecting\nwall at their inner edge, representing a magnetosphere. In transonic discs,\nviscosity can excite several types of global oscillation modes. These modes are\neither axisymmetric with frequencies close to multiples of the maximum radial\nepicyclic frequency $\\kappa_\\mathrm{max}$, non-axisymmetric with frequencies\nclose to multiples of of the innermost stable orbit frequency\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{ISCO}$, or hybrid modes whose frequencies are linear\ncombinations of these two frequencies. Small values of the viscosity parameter\n$\\alpha$ primarily produce non-axisymmetric modes, while axisymmetric modes\nbecome dominant for large $\\alpha$. The excitation of these modes may be\nrelated to an instability of the sonic point, at which the radial infall speed\nis equal to the sound speed of the gas. In discs with a reflective inner\nboundary, we explore the effect of viscosity on trapped $p$-modes which are\nintrinsically overstable due to the corotation resonance effect. The effect of\nviscosity is either to reduce the growth rates of these modes, or to completely\nsuppress them and excite a new class of higher frequency modes. The latter\nrequires that the dynamic viscosity scales positively with the disc surface\ndensity, indicating that it is a result of the classic viscous overstability\neffect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2014 20:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 18:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

Here for each $n=|V|$ we describe a perfect matching\npolytope that is different from Edmonds' polytope and define a weaker notion of\nextended formulation.

For each graph $G$ with $n$ vertices\nwe can readily construct an objective function so that solving the resulting\nlinear program over $Q$ decides whether or not $G$ has a perfect matching.

The method extends to solve\npoly time optimization problems, such as the weighted matching problem.

While the EOS is still poorly known, there are\nalso longstanding ambiguities in choosing General Relativity or alternative\ngravity theories in the not-so-well tested strong-field regime. Besides\npossible appearance of hyperons and new phases, the most uncertain part of the\nnucleonic EOS is currently the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy.\nTo provide information that may help break the EOS-gravity degeneracy, we\ninvestigate effects of symmetry energy within its uncertain range determined by\nterrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments on the gravitational binding energy\nand spacetime curvature of neutron stars within GR and the scalar-tensor (ST)\ntheory of gravity. In particular, we focus on effects of the following\nparameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter: (1) the\nincompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter, (2) the slope $L$ of\nsymmetry energy at saturation density and (3) the high-density behavior of\nsymmetry energy. We find that the variation of either the density slope $L$ or\nthe high-density behavior of symmetry energy leads to large changes in both the\nbinding energy and curvature of neutron stars while effects of varying the more\nconstrained $K_0$ are negligibly small. The difference in predictions using the\nGR and the ST theory appears only for massive neutron stars, and is\nsignificantly smaller than the differences resulting from variations in the\nsymmetry energy. We conclude that within the ST theory of gravity, the\nEOS-gravity degeneracy has been broken by the recent relativistic pulsar\nmeasurements, and that measurements of neutron star properties sensitive to the\ncompactness constrain mainly the density dependence of the symmetry energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 03:46:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 02:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-30"}

We employ the second law of\nthermodynamics as well as the relativistic Boltzmann equation to obtain the\ndissipative evolution equations.\n  We present a new derivation of the dissipative hydrodynamic equations using\nthe second law of thermodynamics wherein all the second-order transport\ncoefficients get determined uniquely within a single theoretical framework. An\nalternate derivation of the dissipative equations which does not make use of\nthe two major approximations/assumptions namely, Grad's 14-moment approximation\nand second moment of Boltzmann equation, inherent in the Israel-Stewart theory,\nis also presented. Moreover, by solving the Boltzmann equation iteratively in a\nChapman-Enskog like expansion, we have derived the form of second-order viscous\ncorrections to the distribution function. Furthermore, a novel third-order\nevolution equation for shear stress tensor is derived. Finally, we generalize\nthe collision term in the Boltzmann equation to include non-local effects. We\nfind that the second-order dissipative equations derived using this modified\nBoltzmann equation contains all possible terms allowed by symmetry.\n  In the case of one-dimensional scaling expansion, we demonstrate the\nnumerical significance of these formulations on the evolution of the hot and\ndense matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We also study\nthe effect of these new formulations on particle (hadron and thermal dilepton)\nspectra and femtoscopic radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 05:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-06"}

Generally, such processes are not\nsimulatable especially for those with infinite activity. In practice, it is\ncommon to approximate them by truncating the jumps at some cut-off size\n$\\varepsilon$ ($\\varepsilon\\searrow 0$). This procedure leads us to consider a\nsimulatable compound Poisson process. This paper first introduces, for this\nsetting, the statistical Romberg method to improve the complexity of the\nclassical Monte Carlo one. Roughly speaking, we use many sample paths with a\ncoarse cut-off $\\varepsilon^{\\beta},$ $\\beta\\in(0,1)$, and few additional\nsample paths with a fine cut-off $\\varepsilon$. Central limit theorems of\nLindeberg-Feller type for both Monte Carlo and statistical Romberg method for\nthe inferred errors depending on the parameter $\\varepsilon$ are proved. This\nleads to an accurate description of the optimal choice of parameters with\nexplicit limit variances. Afterwards, the authors propose a stochastic\napproximation method of finding the optimal measure change by Esscher transform\nfor L\\'evy processes with Monte Carlo and statistical Romberg importance\nsampling variance reduction. Furthermore, we develop new adaptive Monte Carlo\nand statistical Romberg algorithms and prove the associated central limit\ntheorems. Finally, numerical simulations are processed to illustrate the\nefficiency of the adaptive statistical Romberg method that reduces at the same\ntime the variance and the computational effort associated to the effective\ncomputation of option prices when the underlying asset process follows an\nexponential pure jump CGMY model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 09:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-06"}

(ii) The number $C_k$ of $k$-cliques behaves like\n$n^{kp^{k-1}}$ in the sense that $n^{-kp^{k-1}}C_k$ converges against a\nnon-trivial limit, if the starting graph has at least one $k$-clique. In\nparticular, the average degree of a vertex (which equals the number of edges --\nor 2-cliques -- divided by the size of the graph) converges to $0$ iff $p<0.5$\nand we obtain that the transitivity ratio of the random graph is of the order\n$n^{-2p(1-p)}$. (iii) The evolution of the degrees of the vertices in the\ninitial graph can be described explicitly. Here, we obtain the full\ndistribution as well as convergence results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 09:44:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 04:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-24"}

A common feature of non-Abelian T-duality is that in\nthe absence of any global information coming from String Theory it gives rise\nto non-compact dual backgrounds, with coordinates living in the Lie algebra of\nthe Lie group involved in the dualization. In backgrounds with CFT duals this\nposes obvious problems to the CFTs. In this paper we show that for the new\nAdS_4 background the gauge groups of the associated dual CFT undergo a spectral\nflow as the non-compact internal direction runs from 0 to infinity, which\nresembles Seiberg duality in N=1. This phenomenon, very reminiscent of the\ncascade, provides an interpretation in the CFT for the running of the\nnon-compact coordinate, and suggests that at the end of the flow the extra\ncharges disappear and the dual CFT is described by a 2-node quiver very similar\nto ABJM, albeit with reduced supersymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 10:28:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 18:31:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 19:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The array consists of 5 telescopes in a square layout with one central\ntelescope, known as the Pevatron eXplorer or PeX. PeX is a PeV (10^{15} eV)\ncosmic ray explorer that aims to study and discover gamma-ray sources in the 1\nto 500 TeV range. The initial PeX design has been influenced by the HEGRA\nCT-System and H.E.S.S. configurations. One important feature of multi-TeV air\nshowers is their ability to trigger telescopes at large core distance (>400m).\nPeX will utilise large core distance events to improve the performance and\nillustrate the viability of a sparse array for multi-TeV gamma-ray astronomy.\n  One important aspect of the thesis (Chapter 6) was the investigation of a new\ntime-based image cleaning method. The arrival time between photons in two\nadjacent pixels in the camera is used to apply an extra cut which helps\nmitigate night sky background. To illustrate the robustness of the time\ncleaning cut, various level of night sky background have been considered. These\nlevels include: off-Galactic plane, on-Galactic plane and towards the Galactic\ncentre. The most important result is that PeX performance with a time cleaning\ncut improves results when a high level of night sky background is present. For\na Galactic centre level of night sky background there is a factor of 1.5\nimprovement in angular resolution, effective area and quality factor when a\ntime cleaning cut is applied compared to using no time cleaning cut.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 11:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-06"}

Decreasing the volume, the shell remains spherical initially,\nthen undergoes the classical buckling instability, where an axisymmetric dimple\nappears, and, finally, loses its axisymmetry by wrinkles developing in the\nvicinity of the dimple edge in a secondary buckling transition. We describe the\nfirst axisymmetric buckling transition by numerical integration of the complete\nset of shape equations and an approximate analytic model due to Pogorelov. In\nthe buckled shape, both approaches exhibit a locally compressive hoop stress in\na region where experiments and simulations show the development of polygonal\nwrinkles, along the dimple edge. In a simplified model based on the stability\nequations of shallow shells, a critical value for the compressive hoop stress\nis derived, for which the compressed circumferential fibres will buckle out of\ntheir circular shape in order to release the compression. By applying this\nwrinkling criterion to the solutions of the axisymmetric models, we can\ncalculate the critical volume for the secondary buckling transition. Using the\nPogorelov approach, we also obtain an analytical expression for the critical\nvolume at the secondary buckling transition: The critical volume difference\nscales linearly with the bending stiffness, whereas the critical volume\nreduction at the classical axisymmetric buckling transition scales with the\nsquare root of the bending stiffness. These results are confirmed by another\nstability analysis in the framework of Donnel, Mushtari and Vlasov (DMV) shell\ntheory, and by numerical simulations available in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 12:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-12"}

Although there is no dark matter candidate in the original Zee-Babu\nmodel, that is contained in our model by introducing an unbroken discrete $Z_2$\nsymmetry. The discrepancy between the experimental value of the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment (muon $g-2$) and its prediction in the standard model can be\nexplained by contributions from additional vector-like charged-leptons which\nare necessary to give non-zero neutrino masses. The mass of vector-like leptons\nto be slightly above 300 GeV is favored and allowed from the muon $g-2$ and the\ncurrent LHC data. We find that from the structure of neutrino mass matrix,\ndoubly-charged scalar bosons in our model can mainly decay into the same-sign\nand same-flavour dilepton plus missing transverse momentum. By measuring an\nexcess of these events at the LHC, our model can be distinguished from the\nother models including doubly-charged scalar bosons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 13:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

The scattering property of a local scattering center\nis dependent on if it is located on one sublattice (A-site impurity) or both\n(impurity situated at neighboring carbon atoms, A-B-site impurity). The A-site\nimpurity scatters in a similar way as a localized impurity in a one-dimensional\nchannel made from a two-dimensional electron gas. On the other hand, the\nA-B-site impurity introduces A- to B-sublattice scattering, which knows about\nthe chirality of Dirac electrons, and heavily influence the conductance. For\nA-site impurities, interplay between evanescent waves at the impurity and the\npropagating modes contributing to the conductance, leads to scattering\nresonances that generate either dips in the conductance or render the impurity\ncompletely transparent. The latter occurs at subband bottom energies where the\nwave vector of the opening mode is zero. The conductance of defect free\ngraphene therefore remains at these energies. This is analagous to the case of\na scattering center in a quantum channel made from a two-dimensional electron\ngas. The conductance dips occur at energies $\\Delta E$ away from the\nconductance steps and their location depend directly on the impurity strength.\nIn particular, for repulsive impurities the dips occur for hole-doping, while\nfor attractive impurities for electron doping. For an A-B-site impurity, the A-\nto B-sublattice scattering interferes with the transmission resonance at the\nenergies of the subband bottoms and the impurity is never transparent and the\nconductance steps of defect free graphene ribbons are always lost. We derive a\ngeneralized Fisher-Lee formula for graphene leads that holds for arbitrary\nscattering region and arbitrary number of leads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 13:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-06"}

The duals have intuitive structures as the ones in\nlinear programming. The constraints of the duals explicitly indicate the online\ndecisions and naturally lead to competitive algorithms. Second, we use a\ndual-fitting approach, which also based on the weak duality, to study problems\nwhich are unlikely to admit convex relaxations.

It is\ngenerally believed that a large electrodes spacing in photodetectors is\nrequired to absorb sufficient light to maintain high photoresponsivity and\nreduce the dark current. However, this will limit the optoelectronic\nintegration density. Through spatially resolved photocurrent investigation, we\nfind that the photocurrent in metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetectors\nbased on layered GaSe is mainly generated from the photoexcited carriers close\nto the metal-GaSe interface and the photocurrent active region is always close\nto the Schottky barrier with higher electrical potential. The photoresponsivity\nmonotonically increases with shrinking the spacing distance before the direct\ntunneling happen, which was significantly enhanced up to 5,000 AW-1 for the\nbottom contacted device at bias voltage 8 V and wavelength of 410 nm. It is\nmore than 1,700-fold improvement over the previously reported results. Besides\nthe systematically experimental investigation of the dependence of the\nphotoresponsivity on the spacing distance for both the bottom and top contacted\nMSM photodetectors, a theoretical model has also been developed to well explain\nthe photoresponsivity for these two types of device configurations. Our\nfindings realize shrinking the spacing distance and improving the performance\nof 2D semiconductor based MSM photodetectors simultaneously, which could pave\nthe way for future high density integration of 2D semiconductor optoelectronics\nwith high performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 13:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-27"}

The fifth force\nis screened by the nonlinear K-mouflage mechanism if $K'(\\chi)$ grows\nsufficiently fast for large negative $\\chi$. In the general non-spherically\nsymmetric case, the fifth force is not aligned with the Newtonian force. For\nspherically symmetric static matter density profiles, the results depend on the\npotential function $W_{-}(y) = y K'(-y^2/2)$, which must be monotonically\nincreasing to $+\\infty$ for $y \\geq 0$ to guarantee the existence of a single\nsolution throughout space for any matter density profile. Small radial\nperturbations around these static profiles propagate as traveling waves with a\nvelocity greater than the speed of light. Starting from vanishing initial\nconditions for the scalar field and for a time-dependent matter density\ncorresponding to the formation of an overdensity, we numerically check that the\nscalar field converges to the static solution. If $W_{-}$ is bounded, for\nhigh-density objects there are no static solutions throughout space, but one\ncan still define a static solution restricted to large radii. Our dynamical\nstudy shows that the scalar field relaxes to this static solution at large\nradii, whereas spatial gradients keep growing with time at smaller radii. If\n$W_{-}$ is not bounded but non-monotonic, there is an infinite number of\ndiscontinuous static solutions but they are not physical and these models are\nnot theoretically sound. Such K-mouflage scenarios provide an example of\ntheories that can appear viable at the cosmological level, for the cosmological\nbackground and perturbative analysis, while being meaningless at a nonlinear\nlevel for small-scale configurations. This shows the importance of small-scale\nnonlinear analysis of screening models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 13:43:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Nov 2014 21:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

A consensus similarity matrix is formed from an ensemble using\nmultiple algorithms and several values for k. A variety of dimension reduction\ntechniques and clustering algorithms are considered for analysis. For noisy or\nhigh-dimensional data, an iterative technique is presented to refine this\nconsensus matrix in way that encourages algorithms to agree upon a common\nsolution. We utilize the theory of nearly uncoupled Markov chains to determine\nthe number, k , of clusters in a dataset by considering a random walk on the\ngraph defined by the consensus matrix. The eigenvalues of the associated\ntransition probability matrix are used to determine the number of clusters.\nThis method succeeds at determining the number of clusters in many datasets\nwhere previous methods fail. On every considered dataset, our consensus method\nprovides a final result with accuracy well above the average of the individual\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 13:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-06"}

Exploiting the concurrency that is often present is one way to\naddress this problem. Here we study a restricted class of asynchronous\ndistributed probabilistic systems in which the synchronizations determine the\nprobability distribution for the next moves of the participating agents. The\nkey restriction we impose is that the synchronizations are deterministic, in\nthe sense that any two simultaneously enabled synchronizations must involve\ndisjoint sets of agents. As a result, this network of agents can be viewed as a\nsuccinct and distributed presentation of a large global Markov chain. A rich\nclass of Markov chains can be represented this way.\n  We define an interleaved semantics for our model in terms of the local\nsynchronization actions. The network structure induces an independence relation\non these actions, which, in turn, induces an equivalence relation over the\ninterleaved runs in the usual way. We construct a natural probability measure\nover these equivalence classes of runs by exploiting Mazurkiewicz trace theory\nand the probability measure space of the associated global Markov chain.\n  It turns out that verification of our model, called DMCs (distributed Markov\nchains), can often be efficiently carried out by exploiting the partial order\nnature of the interleaved semantics. To demonstrate this, we develop a\nstatistical model checking (SMC) procedure and use it to verify two large\ndistributed probabilistic networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 14:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-06"}

However, current\nstellar models are inaccurate near the surface, which introduces a systematic\ndifference that must be corrected. We introduce and evaluate two\nparametrizations of the surface corrections based on formulae given by Gough\n(1990). The first we call a cubic term proportional to $\\nu^3/\\mathcal{I}$ and\nthe second has an additional inverse term proportional to\n$\\nu^{-1}/\\mathcal{I}$, where $\\nu$ and $\\mathcal{I}$ are the frequency and\ninertia of an oscillation mode.

We then incorporate\nthe parametrizations into a modelling pipeline that simultaneously fits the\nsurface effects and the underlying stellar model parameters. We apply this\npipeline to synthetic observations of a Sun-like stellar model, solar\nobservations degraded to typical asteroseismic uncertainties, and observations\nof the well-studied CoRoT target HD52265. For comparison, we also run the\npipeline with the scaled power-law correction proposed by Kjeldsen et al.\n(2008). The fits to synthetic and degraded solar data show that the method is\nunbiased and produces best-fit parameters that are consistent with the input\nmodels and known parameters of the Sun. Our results for HD52265 are consistent\nwith previous modelling efforts and the magnitude of the surface correction is\nsimilar to that of the Sun. The fit using a scaled power-law correction is\nsignificantly worse but yields consistent parameters ... We find that the cubic\nterm alone is suitable for asteroseismic applications and it is easy to\nimplement in an existing pipeline. ... This parametrization is thus a useful\nnew way to correct model frequencies so that observations of individual mode\nfrequencies can be exploited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 14:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This alternative classification,\nbased on purely dynamical considerations, is relevant notably to understanding\nthe conditions for the existence of so-called quasi-stationary states in\nlong-range interacting systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 15:21:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2015 09:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-08"}

The\nlikelihood of such binary events -- the cornerstone also for the categoric (as\nopposed to probabilistic) prediction of threshold exceedences -- is established\nfrom long time series of one or more observables of the same system. The\nprediction skill is measured by a summary index of the ROC curve that relates\nthe hit- and false alarm rates. Our results for the examined systems suggest\nthat exceedances of higher thresholds are more predictable; or in other words:\nrare large magnitude, i.e., extreme, events are more predictable than frequent\ntypical events. We find this to hold provided that the bin size for binning\ntime series data is optimized, but not necessarily otherwise. This can be\nviewed as a confirmation of a counterintuitive (and seemingly contrafactual)\nstatement that was previously formulated for more simple autoregressive\nstochastic processes. However, we argue that for dynamical systems in general\nit may be typical only, but not universally true. We argue that when there is a\nsufficient amount of data depending on the precision of observation, the skill\nof a class of data-driven categoric predictions of threshold exceedences\napproximates the skill of the analogous model-driven prediction, assuming\nstrictly no model errors. Furthermore, we show that a quantity commonly\nregarded as a measure of predictability, the finite-time maximal Lyapunov\nexponent, does not correspond directly to the ROC-based measure of prediction\nskill when they are viewed as functions of the prediction lead time and the\nthreshold level. This points to the fact that even if the Lyapunov exponent as\nan intrinsic property of the system, measuring the instability of trajectories,\ndetermines predictability, it does that in a nontrivial manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 15:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 May 2015 15:53:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2015 12:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}
