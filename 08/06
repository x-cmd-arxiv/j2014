Yet inference methods\nhave mainly focused on reconstructing, from the network's activity, the spatial\nstructure, by assuming equilibrium conditions or, more recently, a\nprobabilistic dynamics with a single arbitrary time-step. Here we show that,\nunder this latter assumption, the inference procedure fails to reconstruct the\nsynaptic matrix of a network of integrate-and-fire neurons when the chosen time\nscale of interaction does not closely match the synaptic delay or when no\nsingle time scale for the interaction can be identified; such failure,\nmoreover, exposes a distinctive bias of the inference method that can lead to\ninfer as inhibitory the excitatory synapses with interaction time scales longer\nthan the model's time-step. We therefore introduce a new two-step method, that\nfirst infers through cross-correlation profiles the delay-structure of the\nnetwork and then reconstructs the synaptic matrix, and successfully test it on\nnetworks with different topologies and in different activity regimes. Although\nstep one is able to accurately recover the delay-structure of the network, thus\ngetting rid of any \\textit{a priori} guess about the time scales of the\ninteraction, the inference method introduces nonetheless an arbitrary time\nscale, the time-bin $dt$ used to binarize the spike trains. We therefore\nanalytically and numerically study how the choice of $dt$ affects the inference\nin our network model, finding that the relationship between the inferred\ncouplings and the real synaptic efficacies, albeit being quadratic in both\ncases, depends critically on $dt$ for the excitatory synapses only, whilst\nbeing basically independent of it for the inhibitory ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 16:10:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 09:33:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 14:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

In discs with an efficient radiative transport, the\nmigration can be directed outwards for planets with more than 3-5 Earth masses.\nThis is due to the entropy driven corotation torque, a process that extends the\nlifetimes of growing planetary embryos. We investigate the influence on the\ndisc structure caused by a jump in the alpha parameter of the viscosity to\nmodel a dead-zone structure in the disc. We focus on M-dot discs, which have a\nconstant net mass flux. Using the resulting disc structure, we investigate the\nconsequences for the formation of planetesimals and determine the regions of\noutward migration for proto-planets. We performed numerical hydrosimulations of\nM-dot discs in the r-z-plane. We used the explicit/implicit hydrodynamical code\nFARGOCA that includes a full tensor viscosity and stellar irradiation as well\nas a two-temperature solver that includes radiation transport in the\nflux-limited diffusion approximation. Viscosity transitions inside the disc\ncreate transitions in density that stop inward migration for small planets\nthrough the so-called \"planet trap\" mechanism. This mechanism also works for\nplanets down to M_P > 0.5M_E. Additionally, the viscosity transitions change\nthe pressure gradient in the disc, which facilitates planetesimal formation via\nthe streaming instability. However, a very steep transition in viscosity is\nneeded to achieve in a pressure bump in the disc. The transition in viscosity\nfacilitates planetesimal formation and can stop the migration of small-mass\nplanets (M_P>0.5M_E), but still does not halt inward migration of smaller\nplanets and planetesimals that are affected by gas drag. A very steep, probably\nunrealistic viscosity gradient is needed to trap planets of smaller masses and\nhalt gas-drag-driven planetesimal migration at a pressure bump.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 16:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric modeling approach for\nunivariate and multivariate ordinal regression, which is based on mixture\nmodeling for the joint distribution of latent responses and covariates. The\nmodeling framework enables highly flexible inference for ordinal regression\nrelationships, avoiding assumptions of linearity or additivity in the covariate\neffects. In standard parametric ordinal regression models, computational\nchallenges arise from identifiability constraints and estimation of parameters\nrequiring nonstandard inferential techniques. A key feature of the\nnonparametric model is that it achieves inferential flexibility, while avoiding\nthese difficulties. In particular, we establish full support of the\nnonparametric mixture model under fixed cut-off points that relate through\ndiscretization the latent continuous responses with the ordinal responses. The\npractical utility of the modeling approach is illustrated through application\nto two data sets from econometrics, an example involving regression\nrelationships for ozone concentration, and a multirater agreement problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 16:40:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 14:59:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 15:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Generation of such combs in the mid-infrared (IR) spectral region\n(2-20 um) is of great interest due to the presence of a large number of gas\nabsorption lines in this wavelength regime. Recently, frequency combs have been\ndemonstrated in the MIR in several platforms, including fiber combs,\nmode-locked lasers, optical parametric oscillators, and quantum cascade lasers.\nHowever, these platforms are either relatively bulky or challenging to\nintegrate on-chip. An alternative approach using parametric mixing in\nmicroresonators is highly promising since the platform is extremely compact and\ncan operate with relatively low powers. However, material and dispersion\nengineering limitations have prevented the realization of a microresonator comb\nsource past 2.55 um. Although silicon could in principle provide a CMOS\ncompatible platform for on-chip comb generation deep into the mid-IR, to date,\nsilicon's linear and nonlinear losses have prevented the realization of a\nmicroresonator-based comb source. Here we overcome these limitations and\nrealize a broadband frequency comb spanning from 2.1 um to 3.5 um and\ndemonstrate its viability as a spectroscopic sensing platform.

The molecule of interest is covalently connected to\ntwo small metallic clusters, forming an extended molecule complex. The\nquaternion approach allows for an integrated treatment of the charge transport\nin single molecules where both ballistic and co-tunneling (coherent) mechanisms\nare taken on equal footing, although only in the latter case the presence of\neventual transient charged states of the system needs to be considered. We use\na Dyson series to obtain a generalized Fermi golden rule, from which we derive\nan expression for the net current the two electrodes: in doing this, we take\ninto account all possible transitions between electronic states localized at\nthe electrodes and levels in the extended molecule complex. In fact, one can\napply the method to the entire range of coupling regimes, not only in the weak\nor strong cases, but also in intermediate situations, where ballistic and\nco-tunneling processes compete with each other. We also discuss initial results\nof the application of this formalism to the description of the electronic\ntransport in two small organic molecules representative of two different limit\nsituations. In the first case, a conjugated molecule (where spatially\ndelocalized molecular orbitals favor ballistic contributions) is considered,\nand in the second, the current traverses a saturated hydrocarbon (whose\nstructure should contain more localized molecular orbitals). In both cases, we\nfully describe the field-induced self-adjustment of the electronic levels of\nthe extended molecule complex at an ab initio quantum chemical level, using\ndensity functional theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 18:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-06"}

Determining the affinity and kinetic steps of such\ninteractions is challenging due to the competition between hydrophobic\nself-aggregating forces and electrostatic binding forces. Kahalalide F (KF) is\nan anticancer hydrophobic peptide which contains a single positive charge that\nconfers strong aggregative properties with polyanions. This makes KF an ideal\nmodel to elucidate the mechanisms by which self-aggregation competes with\nbinding to a strongly charged polyelectrolyte such as DNA. We use optical\ntweezers to apply mechanical forces to single DNA molecules and show that KF\nand DNA interact in a two-step kinetic process promoted by the electrostatic\nbinding of DNA to the aggregate surface followed by the stabilization of the\ncomplex due to hydrophobic interactions. From the measured pulling curves we\ndetermine the spectrum of binding affinities, kinetic barriers and lengths of\nDNA segments sequestered within the KF-DNA complex.

Even though the\nstellar mass of the host galaxies may be as large as\n$10^{11}-10^{12}~M_{\\odot}$, the AGN emission, with luminosities comparable to\nthose of the most luminous QSOs known, require that either Hot DOGs have black\nhole masses significantly in excess of the local relations, or that they\nradiate significantly above the Eddington limit. We show that, while rare, the\nnumber density of Hot DOGs is comparable to that of equally luminous but\nunobscured (i.e., Type 1) QSOs.

Constraints from the distribution of IMEs, e.g. silicon and\nmagnesium, indicate that the outer ejecta did not experience significant mixing\nduring or after burning, and the late phase NIR line profiles suggests most of\nthe (56)Ni is produced during high density burning. The various observational\nproperties of SN 2012Z are found to be consistent with the theoretical\nexpectations of a Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf progenitor that experiences a\npulsational delayed detonation, which produced several tenths of a solar mass\nof (56)Ni during the deflagration burning phase and little (or no) (56)Ni\nduring the detonation phase. Within this scenario only a moderate amount of\nRayleigh-Taylor mixing occurs both during the deflagration and fallback phase\nof the pulsation, and the layered structure of the IMEs is a product of the\nsubsequent denotation phase.

The so-obtained intrinsic shape\ndistribution for the fast rotators can be described with a Gaussian with a mean\nflattening of q=0.25 and standard deviation sigma_q = 0.14, and an additional\ntail towards rounder shapes. The slow rotators are much rounder, and are well\ndescribed with a Gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and sigma_q =0.09. We then checked\nthat our results were consistent when applying a different and independent\nmethod to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observed\nellipticity distributions directly using Gaussian parametrisations for the\nintrinsic axis ratios. Although both fast and slow rotators are identified as\nearly-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shape\nstudies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions are\nsignificantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. The\nintrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with the\nspiral galaxy population.

We use the same astrophysical parameters regulating\nstar formation and feedback, chosen to match current observations of the\nevolving ultra violet luminosity function (UV LF). We find that the assembly of\nobservable (with current and upcoming instruments) galaxies in CDM and $m_x\n\\geq 3 {\\rm keV}$ WDM results in similar halo mass to light ratios (M/L),\nstellar mass densities (SMDs) and UV LFs. However the suppression of\nsmall-scale structure leads to a notably delayed and subsequently more rapid\nstellar assembly in the $1.5 {\\rm keV}$ WDM model. Thus galaxy assembly in $m_x\n\\leq 2 {\\rm keV}$ WDM cosmologies is characterized by: (i) a dearth of\nsmall-mass halos hosting faint galaxies; and (ii) a younger, more UV bright\nstellar population, for a given stellar mass. The higher M/L ratio (effect ii)\npartially compensates for the dearth of small-mass halos (effect i), making the\nresulting UV LFs closer to CDM than expected from simple estimates of halo\nabundances. We find that the redshift evolution of the SMD is a powerful probe\nof the nature of DM. Integrating down to a limit of $M_{UV} =-16.5$ for the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the SMD evolves as $\\log$(SMD)$\\propto -0.63\n(1+z)$ in $m_x = 1.5 {\\rm keV}$ WDM, as compared to $\\log$(SMD)$\\propto -0.44\n(1+z)$ in CDM.

The most pronounced role of DM annihilations is in heating the IGM\nearlier and more uniformly than astrophysical sources of X-rays.

The challenge\nconsists in discovering the whole NMSSM Higgs mass spectrum. We present the\nrates for production and subsequent decay of the neutral NMSSM Higgs bosons in\nthe most promising final states and discuss their possible discovery. The\nprospects for pinning down the Higgs sector of the Natural NMSSM will be\nanalysed taking into account alternative search channels. We give a series of\nbenchmark scenarios compatible with the experimental constraints, that feature\nHiggs-to-Higgs decays and entail (exotic) signatures with multi-fermion and/or\nmulti-photon final states. These decay chains furthermore give access to the\ntrilinear Higgs self-couplings.

Spin-orbit interaction, due to its relativistic\nnature, is typically small in solids, and is often taken into account\nperturbatively. It has been recently realized, however, that materials with\nstrong spin-orbit coupling can lead to novel states of matter such as\ntopological insulators and superconductors. This exciting development might\nlead to a number of useful applications ranging from spintronics to quantum\ncomputing. In particular, theory predicts that narrow band gap semiconductors\nwith strong spin-obit coupling are a suitable platform for the realization of\nMajorana zero-energy modes, predicted to obey exotic non-Abelian braiding\nstatistics. The pursuit for realizing Majorana modes in condensed matter\nsystems and investigating their exotic properties has been a subject of\nintensive experimental research recently. Here, we demonstrate the first\nrealization of gate-defined wires where one-dimensional confinement is created\nusing electrostatic potentials, on large area InAs two dimensional electron\nsystems (2DESs). The electronic properties of the parent 2DES are fully\ncharacterized in the region that wires are formed. The strength of the\nspin-orbit interaction has been measured and tuned while the high mobility of\nthe 2DES is maintained in the wire. We show that this scheme could provide new\nprospective solutions for scalable and complex wire networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 21:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-07"}

The four-quark wave functions\nare constructed based on a diquark-antidiquark form under the constraint that\nthey form an antitriplet $\\bar{\\bf{3}}_f$ in $\\mbox{SU(3)}_f$, which seems to\nbe realized in some of the excited states listed in Particle Data Group.\nDepending on the structure of antidiquark, we construct two possible models for\nits wave functions: Model I) the antidiquark is symmetric in flavor\n($\\bar{\\bf{6}}_f$) and antisymmetric in color ($\\bf{3}_c$) and Model II) the\nantidiquark is antisymmetric in flavor ($\\bf{3}_f$) and symmetric in color\n($\\bar{\\bf{6}}_c$). To test phenomenological relevance of these wave functions,\nwe calculate the mass differences among the excited states of spin $J=0,1,2$\nusing color-spin interactions. The four-quark wave functions based on Model~I\nis found to reproduce the observed mass of the excited states of heavy mesons.\nAlso, our four-quark model provides an interesting phenomenology relating to\nthe decay widths of the excited states. To further pursue the possibility of\nthe four-quark structure, we make a few predictions for open charm and open\nbottom states that may be discovered in future experiments. Most of them are\nexpected to have broad widths, which would make them difficult to be identified\nexperimentally. However, one resonance with $J=1$ containing bottom and strange\nquarks is expected to appear as a sharp peak with its mass around $B^{\\bar\ns}_{1N} \\sim 5753$~MeV. Confirmation of the existence of such states in future\nexperiments will shed light on our understanding of the structure of heavy\nmeson excited states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 23:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We find that the three-body Laplace angle\nvalues are distributed unevenly and have histograms showing structure, if the\nangle is associated with a resonant chain, with both pairs of bodies near\nfirst-order two-body resonances. Estimated three-body resonance libration\nfrequencies can be only an order of magnitude lower than those of first-order\nresonances. Their strength arises from a small divisor from the distance to the\nfirst-order resonances and insensitivity to eccentricity, which make up for\ntheir dependence on moon mass. Three-body resonances associated with\nlow-integer Laplace angles can also be comparatively strong due to the many\nmultiples of the angle contributed from Fourier components of the interaction\nterms. We attribute small coupled variations in semi-major axis, seen\nthroughout the simulation, to ubiquitous and weak three-body resonant\ncouplings. We show that a system with two pairs of bodies in first-order\nmean-motion resonance can be transformed to resemble the well-studied\nperiodically-forced pendulum with the frequency of a Laplace angle serving as a\nperturbation frequency. We identify trios of bodies and overlapping pairs of\ntwo-body resonances in each trio that have particularly short estimated\nLyapunov timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Aug 2014 23:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

Here we address the problem of quantifying populations,\nwith our analysis directed toward systems for which previously defined\nalgorithms allow the sequence-based identification of clonal subpopulations.\nData come from replicate sequencing libraries generated from a sample,\npotentially with very different depths. While certain properties of the\nunderlying clonal distribution (most notably the total number of clones) are\ndifficult to estimate accurately from data representing a small fraction of the\ntotal population, the population-level \"clonality\" metric that is the sum of\nsquared probabilities of the respective species can be calculated.

The clonality score is the probability of a clonal relationship\nbetween two randomly chosen members of the population of interest.

We recall the potential\ndifficulties with various topological defects - monopoles, strings and domain\nwalls generated at the SSB (spontaneous symmetry breaking) of various gauge\nsymmetries. The main part of the paper is devoted to discussing difficulties\nwith long-lived heavy particles, which could be dark matter but cannot\nefficiently annihilate to the required residual density because of basic\nS-Matrix unitarity/analyticity limits.

However, diseases such as cancer are a\nresult of the combined effect of multiple genes. Gene products such as proteins\nseldom act in isolation, but instead constitute stable multi-protein complexes\nperforming dedicated functions. Therefore, complexes aggregate the effect of\nindividual genes (proteins) and can be used to gain a better understanding of\ncancer mechanisms. Here, we observe that complexes show considerable changes in\ntheir expression, in turn directed by the concerted action of transcription\nfactors (TFs), across cancer conditions. We seek to gain novel insights into\ncancer mechanisms through a systematic analysis of complexes and their\ntranscriptional regulation.\n  Results: We integrated large-scale protein-interaction (PPI) and\ngene-expression datasets to identify complexes that exhibit significant changes\nin their expression across different conditions in cancer. We devised a\nlog-linear model to relate these changes to the differential regulation of\ncomplexes by TFs. The application of our model on two case studies involving\npancreatic and familial breast tumour conditions revealed: (i) complexes in\ncore cellular processes, especially those responsible for maintaining genome\nstability and cell proliferation (e.g. DNA damage repair and cell cycle) show\nconsiderable changes in expression; (ii) these changes include decrease and\ncountering increase for different sets of complexes indicative of compensatory\nmechanisms coming into play in tumours; and (iii) TFs work in cooperative and\ncounteractive ways to regulate these mechanisms.

The direct\nmagnetic coupling of the core to the extended convective envelope of red giants\nand supergiants appears unlikely.

This coupling is able to produce a strong spin down of the core of red\ngiants and supergiants, also leading to relatively slowly rotating stellar\nremnants, like white dwarfs and pulsars.

Two similar models\nhave been proposed, one by Di\\'osi [D-model] and one by Karolyhazy and\ncollaborators [K-model], based on apparently unrelated minimal spacetime\nbounds. The two models arrive at somewhat different expressions for the\ndependence of the localization coherence length on the mass and size of the\nquantum object. In the present article we compare and contrast the two models\nfrom three aspects: (i) comparison of the spacetime bounds, (ii) method of\ncalculating decoherence time, (iii) comparison of noise correlation. We show\nthat under certain conditions the minimal spacetime bounds in the two models\ncan be derived one from the other. We argue that the methods of calculating the\ndecoherence time are equivalent. We re-derive the two-point correlation for the\nfluctuation potential in the K-model, and confirm the earlier result of Di\\'osi\nand Luk\\'acs that it is non-white noise, unlike in the D-model, where the\ncorresponding correlation is white noise in time. This seems to be the origin\nof the different results in the two models. We derive the non-Markovian master\nequation for the K-model. We argue that the minimal spacetime bound cannot\npredict the noise correlation uniquely, and additional criteria are necessary\nto accurately determine the effects of gravitationally induced decoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 06:53:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 18:19:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2015 14:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

Illustrations are presented to support the performance of the\nresulting estimators both in terms of efficiency and robustness through\nextensive simulation studies and real data examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 10:50:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 14:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-04"}

Starquakes have the potential to excite some of the oscillation modes of\nthe neutron star, which means that they are of interest as a source of\ngravitational waves. These oscillations could also have an impact on radio\nemission. In this paper we make upper estimates of the amplitude of the\noscillations produced by a starquake, and the corresponding gravitational wave\nemission. We then develop a more detailed framework for calculating the\noscillations excited by the starquake, using a toy model of a solid,\nincompressible star where all strain is lost instantaneously from the star at\nthe glitch. For this toy model, we give plots of the amplitudes of the modes\nexcited, as the shear modulus and rotation rate of the star are varied. We find\nthat for our specific model, the largest excitation is generally of a mode\nsimilar to the $f$-mode of an incompressible fluid star, but that other modes\nof the star are excited to a significant degree over small parameter ranges of\nthe rotation rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 11:29:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Oct 2014 20:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The seeds of the first supermassive black holes may have resulted\nfrom the direct collapse of hot primordial gas in $\\gtrsim 10^4$ K haloes,\nforming a supermassive or quasistar as an intermediate stage.\n  Aims. We explore the formation of a protostar resulting from the collapse of\nprimordial gas in the presence of a strong Lyman-Werner radiation background.\nParticularly, we investigate the impact of turbulence and rotation on the\nfragmentation behaviour of the gas cloud. We accomplish this goal by varying\nthe initial turbulent and rotational velocities.\n  Methods. We performed 3D adaptive mesh refinement simulations with a\nresolution of 64 cells per Jeans length using the ENZO code, simulating the\nformation of a protostar up to unprecedentedly high central densities of\n$10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$, and spatial scales of a few solar radii. To achieve this\ngoal, we employed the KROME package to improve modelling of the chemical and\nthermal processes.\n  Results. We find that the physical properties of the simulated gas clouds\nbecome similar on small scales, irrespective of the initial amount of\nturbulence and rotation. After the highest level of refinement was reached, the\nsimulations have been evolved for an additional ~5 freefall times. A single\nbound clump with a radius of $2 \\times 10^{-2}$ AU and a mass of ~$7 \\times\n10^{-2}$ M$_{\\odot}$ is formed at the end of each simulation, marking the onset\nof protostar formation. No strong fragmentation is observed by the end of the\nsimulations, regardless of the initial amount of turbulence or rotation, and\nhigh accretion rates of a few solar masses per year are found.\n  Conclusions. Given such high accretion rates, a quasistar of $10^5$\nM$_{\\odot}$ is expected to form within $10^5$ years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 12:06:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 13:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

We show that involvement of a sterile in the (3+1)\nmodel, induces that $|U_{e4}|^2= 0.040$, $|U_{\\mu4}|^2= 0.009$ and $\\sin^2\n2\\alpha=0.067$. We also find a new self-complementarity\n$\\vartheta_{12}+\\vartheta_{23}+\\vartheta_{13}+\\alpha\\approx90^\\circ$. The\nnumbers are generally consistent with those obtained by fitting recent\nmeasurements, especially in this scenario, the existence of a sterile neutrino\ndoes not upset the LEP data i.e. the number of neutrino types is very close to\n3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 15:13:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 06:39:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

We\npropose here a new explanation - not requiring an extreme release of energy -\ninvolving a body (planet, asteroid, white dwarf) orbiting an extragalactic\npulsar. We investigate a theory of radio waves associated to such\npulsar-orbiting bodies. We focus our analysis on the waves emitted from the\nmagnetic wake of the body in the pulsar wind. After deriving their properties,\nwe compare them with the observations of various transient radio signals in\norder to see if they could originate from pulsar-orbiting bodies. The analysis\nis based on the theory of Alfv\\'en wings: for a body immersed in a pulsar wind,\na system of two stationary Alfv\\'en waves is attached to the body, provided\nthat the wind is highly magnetized. When destabilized through plasma\ninstabilities, Alfv\\'en wings can be the locus of strong radio sources\nconvected with the pulsar wind. Assuming a cyclotron maser instability\noperating in the Alfv\\'en wings, we make predictions about the shape,\nfrequencies and brightness of the resulting radio emissions. Because of the\nbeaming by relativistic aberration, the signal is seen only when the companion\nis perfectly aligned between its parent pulsar and the observer, as for\noccultations. For pulsar winds with a high Lorentz factor, the whole duration\nof the radio event does not exceed a few seconds, and it is composed of one to\nfour peaks lasting a few milliseconds each, detectable up to distances of\nseveral Mpc. The Lorimer burst, the three isolated pulses of PSR J1928+15, and\nthe recently detected fast radio bursts are all compatible with our model.\nAccording to it, these transient signals should repeat periodically with the\ncompanion's orbital period. The search of pulsar-orbiting bodies could be an\nexploration theme for new- or next-generation radio telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 15:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

First, a new image feature\ncalled Normalized Pixel Difference (NPD) is proposed. NPD feature is computed\nas the difference to sum ratio between two pixel values, inspired by the Weber\nFraction in experimental psychology. The new feature is scale invariant,\nbounded, and is able to reconstruct the original image. Second, we propose a\ndeep quadratic tree to learn the optimal subset of NPD features and their\ncombinations, so that complex face manifolds can be partitioned by the learned\nrules. This way, only a single soft-cascade classifier is needed to handle\nunconstrained face detection. Furthermore, we show that the NPD features can be\nefficiently obtained from a look up table, and the detection template can be\neasily scaled, making the proposed face detector very fast.
