This\nnovel version of the previously introduced TOP method alleviates some\ninconsistencies by imposing that the lead-lag relationship should be invariant\nwith respect to a time reversal of the time series after a change of sign. This\nmeans that, if `$X$ comes before $Y$', this transforms into `$Y$ comes before\n$X$' under a time reversal. We show that previously proposed bootstrap test\nlacks power and leads too often to a lack of rejection of the null that there\nis no lead-lag correlation when it is present. We introduce instead two novel\ntests. The first the free energy p-value $\\rho$ criterion quantifies the\nprobability that a given lead-lag structure could be obtained from random time\nseries with similar characteristics except for the lead-lag information. The\nsecond self-consistent test embodies the idea that, for the lead-lag path to be\nsignificant, synchronizing the two time series using the time varying lead-lag\npath should lead to a statistically significant correlation. We perform\nintensive synthetic tests to demonstrate their performance and limitations.\nFinally, we apply the TOPS method with the two new tests to the time dependent\nlead-lag structures of house price and monetary policy of the United Kingdom\n(UK) and United States (US) from 1991 to 2011. The TOPS approach stresses the\nimportance of accounting for change of regimes, so that similar pieces of\ninformation or policies may have drastically different impacts and\ndevelopments, conditional on the economic, financial and geopolitical\nconditions.

The approach is well-suited for\nstatistical analyses that bin clusters according to other mass proxies. We find\nthat current experiments, such as Planck, the South Pole Telescope and the\nAtacama Cosmology Telescope, can practically implement such a statistical\nmethodology, and that future experiments will reach sensitivities sufficient\nfor individual measurements of massive systems.

We\nexplore different choices of channel wave functions and transition operators\nand show that a conventional CDCC volume matrix element can be written in terms\nof a surface-integral matrix element, which is peripheral, and an auxiliary\nmatrix element, which determines the contribution of the nuclear interior over\nthe variable $r_{nA}$. This auxiliary matrix element appears due to the\ninconsistency in treating of the $n-A$ potential: this potential should be real\nin the final state to support bound states or resonance scattering and complex\nin the initial state to describe $n-A$ scattering. Our main result is\nformulation of the theory of the stripping to resonance states using the prior\nform of the surface integral formalism and CDCC method. It is demonstrated that\nthe conventional CDCC volume matrix element coincides with the surface matrix\nelement, which converges for the stripping to the resonance state. Also the\nsurface representation (over the variable $r_{nA}$ of the stripping matrix\nelement enhances the peripheral part of the amplitude although the internal\ncontribution doesn't disappear and increases with increase of the deuteron\nenergy. We present calculations corroborating our findings for both stripping\nto the bound state and the resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Aug 2014 23:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We develop a simple method\nto estimate the soft decoding performance, which avoids extensive simulations.\nAlso, a simulation-based algorithm is proposed to obtain the maximum likelihood\ndecoding performance of QR codes of lengths within 100. Moreover, four\nimportant theorems are proposed to predict the performance of the hard decoding\nand the maximum-likelihood decoding in which they can explore some internal\nproperties of QR codes. It is shown that such four theorems can be applied to\nthe QR codes with lengths less than 100 for predicting the decoding\nperformance. In contrast, they can be straightforwardly generalized to longer\nQR codes. The result is never seen in the literature, to our knowledge.\nSimulation results show that the estimated hard decoding performance is very\naccurate in the whole signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, whereas the derived\nupper bounds of the maximum likelihood decoding are only tight for moderate to\nhigh SNR regions. For each of the considered QR codes, the soft decoding is\napproximately 1.5 dB better than the hard decoding. By using powerful redundant\nparity-check cuts, the linear programming-based decoding algorithm, i.e., the\nACG-ALP decoding algorithm performs very well for any QR code. Sometimes, it is\neven superior to the Chase-based soft decoding algorithm significantly, and\nhence is only a few tenths of dB away from the maximum likelihood decoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 07:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

Simulating complicated\ngeometries requires unstructured spatial discretization which results in\nirregular memory access patterns severely limiting computing performance.

The disc-locking prevents the star to spin its rotation up, and its\ntimescale depends on the disc lifetime. Some mechanisms can significantly\nshorten this lifetime, allowing a few stars to start spinning up much earlier\nthan other stars. In the present study, we aim to investigate how the\nproperties of the circumstellar environment can shorten the disc lifetime. We\nhave identified a few multiple stellar systems, composed of stars with similar\nmasses, which belong to associations with a known age. Since all parameters\nthat are responsible for the rotational evolution, with the exception of\nenvironment properties and initial stellar rotation, are similar for all\ncomponents, we expect that significant differences among the rotation periods\ncan only arise from differences in the disc lifetimes. A photometric timeseries\nallowed us to measure the rotation periods of each component, while\nhigh-resolution spectra provided us with the fundamental parameters, $v\\sin{i}$\nand chromospheric line fluxes. The rotation periods of the components differ\nsignificantly, and the component B, which has a closer companion C, rotates\nfaster than the more distant and isolated component A. We can ascribe the\nrotation period difference to either different initial rotation periods or\ndifferent disc-locking phases arising from the presence of the close companion\nC. In the specific case of BD$-$21 1074, the second scenario seems to be more\nfavored. In our hypothesis of different disc-locking phase, any planet orbiting\nthis star is likely formed very rapidly owing to a gravitational instability\nmechanism, rather than core accretion. Only a large difference of initial\nrotation periods alone could account for the observed period difference,\nleaving comparable disc lifetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 10:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

So far, the Stanley depth is known only for a few\nexamples of this type. Our proof consists in a close analysis of a matching in\nthe Boolean algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 11:48:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 13:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

The\npopulation dynamics of such sequential acquisition of (epi)genetic alterations\nhas been the topic of much investigation. The phenomenon of stochastic\ntunneling, where an intermediate mutant in a sequence does not reach fixation\nin a population before generating a double mutant, has been studied using a\nvariety of computational and mathematical methods. However, the field still\nlacks a comprehensive analytical description since theoretical predictions of\nfixation times are only available for cases in which the second mutant is\nadvantageous. Here, we study stochastic tunneling in a Moran model. Analyzing\nthe deterministic dynamics of large populations we systematically identify the\nparameter regimes captured by existing approaches. Our analysis also reveals\nfitness landscapes and mutation rates for which finite populations are found in\nlong-lived metastable states. These are landscapes in which the final mutant is\nnot the most advantageous in the sequence, and resulting metastable states are\na consequence of a mutation-selection balance. The escape from these states is\ndriven by intrinsic noise, and their location affects the probability of\ntunneling. Existing methods no longer apply. In these regimes it is the escape\nfrom the metastable states that is the key bottleneck; fixation is no longer\nlimited by the emergence of a successful mutant lineage. We used the so-called\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method to compute fixation times in these parameter\nregimes, successfully validated by stochastic simulations. Our work fills a gap\nleft by previous approaches and provides a more comprehensive description of\nthe acquisition of multiple mutations in populations of somatic cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 12:16:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2015 19:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-09"}

In this context, we investigate whether it is possible to\nsynthesize a stabilizing event-triggered feedback law for networked control\nsystems (NCS) which have two time-scales, based only on an approximate model of\nthe slow dynamics. We follow an emulation-like approach as we assume that we\nknow how to solve the problem in the absence of sampling and then we study how\nto design the event-triggering rule under communication constraints. The NCS is\nmodeled as a hybrid singularly perturbed system which exhibits the feature to\ngenerate jumps for both the fast variable and the error variable induced by the\nsampling. The first conclusion is that a triggering law which guarantees the\nstability and the existence of a uniform minimum amount of time between two\ntransmissions for the slow model may not ensure the existence of such a time\nfor the overall system, which makes the controller not implementable in\npractice. The objective of this contribution is twofold. We first show that\nexisting event-triggering conditions can be adapted to singularly perturbed\nsystems and semiglobal practical stability can be ensured in this case. Second,\nwe propose another technique that combines event-triggered and time-triggered\nresults in the sense that transmissions are only allowed after a predefined\namount of time has elapsed since the last transmission. This technique has the\nadvantage, under an additional assumption, to ensure a global asymptotic\nstability property and to allow the user to directly tune the minimum\ninter-transmission interval. We believe that this technique is of its own\ninterest independently of the two-time scale nature of the addressed problem.\nThe results are shown to be applicable to a class of globally Lipschitz\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 12:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

To date,\nthere are still no firm constraints on its total luminosity, due to the\ndifficulty of disentangling Hercules bona-fide stars from the severe Galactic\nfield contamination. In order to better constrain Hercules properties we aim at\nremoving foreground and background contaminants in the galaxy field using the\nproper motions of the Milky Way stars and the colour-colour diagram. We have\nobtained images of Hercules in the rSloan, BBessel and Uspec bands with the\nLarge Binocular Telescope (LBT) and LBC-BIN mode capabilities. The rSloan new\ndata-set combined with data from the LBT archive span a time baseline of about\n5 yr, allowing us to measure for the first time proper motions of stars in the\nHercules direction. The Uspec data along with existing LBT photometry allowed\nus to use colour-colour diagram to further remove the field contamination.\nThanks to a highly-accurate procedure to derive the rSloan-filter geometric\ndistortion solution for the LBC-red, we were able to measure stellar relative\nproper motions to a precision of better than 5 mas yr^-1 down to rSloan=22 mag\nand disentangle a significant fraction (\\>90\\%) of Milky Way contaminants.

A sub-group of 4 oxygen-rich candidate stars depicts a\nfaint, red extension of the well-defined SagDIG carbon-rich sequence. The\norigin of these oxygen-rich candidate stars remains unclear, reflecting the\nuncertainty in the ratio of carbon/oxygen rich stars. SagDIG is also a gas-rich\ngalaxy characterized by a single large cavity in the gas disk (HI-hole), which\nis offset by ~360 pc from the optical centre of the galaxy. We nonetheless\ninvestigate the stellar feedback hypothesis by comparing the proper-motion\ncleaned stellar populations within the HI-hole with appropriately selected\ncomparison regions, having higher HI densities external to the hole. The\ncomparison shows no significant differences. In particular, the centre of the\nHI-hole (and the comparison regions) lack stellar populations younger than ~400\nMyr, which are otherwise abundant in the inner body of the galaxy. We conclude\nthat there is no convincing evidence that the SagDIG HI-hole is the result of\nstellar feedback, and that gravitational and thermal instabilities in the gas\nare the most likely mechanism for its formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 13:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

From the first 200\ngalaxies observed by CALIFA, we present the 2D kinematic view of the 177\ngalaxies satisfying a gas detection threshold. After removing the stellar\ncontribution, we used the cross-correlation technique to obtain the radial\nvelocity of the dominant gaseous component. The main kinematic parameters were\ndirectly derived from the radial velocities with no assumptions on the internal\nmotions. Evidence of the presence of several gaseous components with different\nkinematics were detected by using [OIII] profiles. Most objects in the sample\nshow regular velocity fields, although the ionized-gas kinematics are rarely\nconsistent with simple coplanar circular motions. 35% of the objects present\nevidence of a displacement between the photometric and kinematic centers larger\nthan the original spaxel radii. Only 17% of the objects in the sample exhibit\nkinematic lopsidedness when comparing receding and approaching sides of the\nvelocity fields, but most of them are interacting galaxies exhibiting nuclear\nactivity. Early-type galaxies in the sample present clear photometric-kinematic\nmisaligments. There is evidence of asymmetries in the emission line profiles\nsuggesting the presence of kinematically distinct gaseous components at\ndifferent distances from the nucleus. This work constitutes the first\ndetermination of the ionized gas kinematics of the galaxies observed in the\nCALIFA survey. The derived velocity fields, the reported kinematic\npeculiarities and the identification of the presence of several gaseous\ncomponents might be used as additional criteria for selecting galaxies for\nspecific studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 14:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

As a result, the\nstandard interpretations of many galaxy observables (which assume a slowly\nvarying SFH) are often incorrect. Here, we use the SFHs from hydro-dynamical\nsimulations to investigate the effects of bursty SFHs on sample selection and\ninterpretation of observables and make predictions to confirm such SFHs in\nfuture surveys. First, because dwarf galaxies' star formation rates change\nrapidly, the mass-to-light ratio is also changing rapidly in both the ionizing\ncontinuum and, to a lesser extent, the non-ionizing UV continuum. Therefore,\nflux limited surveys are highly biased toward selecting galaxies in the\n\\emph{burst} phase and very deep observations are required to detect all dwarf\ngalaxies at a given stellar mass. Second, we show that a $\\log_{10}[\\nu\nL_{\\nu}(1500{\\rm \\AA})/L_{{\\rm H}\\alpha}]>2.5$ implies a very recent quenching\nof star formation and can be used as evidence of stellar feedback regulating\nstar formation. Third, we show that the ionizing continuum can be significantly\nhigher than when assuming a constant SFH, which can affect the interpretation\nof nebular emission line equivalent widths and direct ionizing continuum\ndetections. Finally, we show that a star formation rate estimate based on\ncontinuum measurements only (and not on nebular tracers such as the hydrogen\nBalmer lines) will not trace the rapid changes in star formation and will give\nthe false impression of a star-forming main sequence with low dispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 15:08:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2015 14:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}

We look for differences in the spectrum between two opposite\nhemispheres and also for dipolar modulations. We propose a new way to avoid\nbiases due to partial-sky coverage by producing a mask symmetrized in antipodal\ndirections, in addition to the standard smoothing procedure. We also properly\ntake into account both Doppler and aberration effects due to our peculiar\nvelocity and the anisotropy of the noise, since these effects induce a\nsignificant hemispherical asymmetry. We are thus able to probe scales all the\nway to ell = 2000. After such treatment we find no evidence for significant\nhemispherical anomalies (i.e. deviations are less than 1.5 sigma when summing\nover all scales). Although among the larger scales there are sometimes higher\ndiscrepancies, these are always less than 3 sigma. We also find results on a\ndipolar modulation of the power spectrum. Along the hemispheres aligned with\nthe most asymmetric direction for 2 <= ell <= 2000 we find a 3.3 sigma\ndiscrepancy when comparing to simulations. However, if we do not restrict\nourselves to Planck's maximal asymmetry axis, which can only be known a\nposteriori, and compare Planck data with the modulation of simulations along\ntheir respective maximal asymmetry directions, the discrepancy goes down to\nless than 1 sigma (with, again, almost 3 sigma discrepancies in some low-ell\nmodes). We thus conclude that no significant power asymmetries seem to be\npresent in the full data set. Interestingly, without proper removal of Doppler\nand aberration effects one would find spurious anomalies at high ell, between 3\nsigma and 5 sigma. Even when considering only ell < 600 we find that the boost\nis non-negligible and alleviates the discrepancy by roughly half-sigma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 15:12:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 20:03:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 16:19:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

Revealing thermodynamic origin of a given\nmolecular process is an important but difficult task, and general principles\ngoverning protein conformational distributions remain elusive. Here we\ndemonstrate that when protein molecules are taken as thermodynamic systems and\nsolvents being treated as the environment, conformational entropy is an\nexcellent proxy for free energy and is sufficient to explain protein\nconformational distributions. Specifically, by defining each unique combination\nof side chain torsional state as a conformer, the population distribution (or\nfree energy) on an arbitrarily given order parameter is approximately a linear\nfunction of conformational entropy. Additionally, span of various microscopic\npotential energy terms is observed to be highly correlated with both\nconformational entropy and free energy. Presently widely utilized free energy\nproxies, including minimum potential energy, average potential energy terms by\nthemselves or in combination with vibrational entropy\\cite, are found to\ncorrelate with free energy rather poorly. Therefore, our findings provide a\nfundamentally new theoretical base for development of significantly more\nreliable and efficient next generation computational tools, where the number of\navailable conformers,rather than poential energy of microscopic configurations,\nis the central focus.

It is\nalso mentioned that the \"fermion-boson puzzle\" known in the presence of a 't\nHooft--Polyakov monopole does not exist in our theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 11:20:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2015 04:23:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 04:46:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 05:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}
