In this case, a photon heralding scheme may be used to reject the\nuncorrelated noise photons in order to restore the quantum bit-error rate to a\nlow level. However, the secure key rate would suffer unless one uses a heralded\nphoton source with sufficiently high heralding rate and heralding efficiency.\nIn this work we demonstrate a heralded photon source that has a heralding\nefficiency that is as high as 74.5%. One disadvantage of a typical heralded\nphoton source is that the long deadtime of the heralding detector results in a\nsignificant drop in the heralding rate. To counter this problem, we propose a\npassively spatial-multiplexed configuration at the heralding arm. Using two\nheralding detectors in this configuration, we obtain an increase in the\nheralding rate by 37% and a corresponding increase in the heralded photon\ndetection rate by 16%. We transmitted the O-band photons over 10 km of noisy\noptical fiber to observe the relation between quantum bit-error rate and\nnoise-degraded second-order correlation function of the transmitted photons.\nThe effects of afterpulsing when we shorten the deadtime of the heralding\ndetectors are also observed and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2014 16:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-08"}

Broadband phase-integrated spectra over the 0.2-20 keV band\nwith NuSTAR and archival XMM-Newton data do not fit to a conventional\ntwo-component model of a blackbody plus power-law, but instead exhibit spectral\nhardening above ~5 keV. We find two spectral models fit the data well: (1) a\nblackbody (kT1 ~ 42 eV) with a broken power-law (Gamma1 ~ 2.0, Gamma2 ~ 1.4 and\nEbreak ~ 3.4 keV), and (2) two blackbody components (kT1 ~ 44 eV and kT2 ~ 195\neV) with a power-law component (Gamma ~ 1.7). In both cases, the extrapolation\nof the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the thermal component is consistent with the UV\ndata, while the non-thermal component overpredicts the near-infrared data,\nrequiring a spectral flattening at E ~ 0.01 - 1 keV.

The proposed Hamiltonian is local and translationally\ninvariant in the bulk. We prove that it is frustration free and has a unique\nground state. Moreover, we prove that the energy gap scales as $n^{-c}$, where\nusing the theory of Brownian excursions, we prove $c\\ge2$.

In Si, the relaxation could also be through the\nmixing of spin and valley states. We find that the additional spin relaxation\nchannel, via spin-valley mixing and electrical noise, is indeed important for\nan electron spin in a Si quantum dot. By considering both spin-valley and\nintravalley spin-orbit mixings and Johnson noise in a Si device, we find that\nthe spin relaxation rate peaks at the hot spot, where the Zeeman splitting\nmatches the valley splitting.

Presented here is an alternative approach to\nconstructing point charge water models - currently, the most commonly used\ntype. In contrast to the conventional approach, we do not impose any geometry\nconstraints on the model other than symmetry. Instead, we optimize the\ndistribution of point charges to best describe the \"electrostatics\" of the\nwater molecule, which is key to many unusual properties of liquid water. The\nsearch for the optimal charge distribution is performed in 2D parameter space\nof key lowest multipole moments of the model, to find best fit to a small set\nof bulk water properties at room temperature. A virtually exhaustive search is\nenabled via analytical equations that relate the charge distribution to the\nmultipole moments. The resulting \"optimal\" 3-charge, 4-point rigid water model\n(OPC) reproduces a comprehensive set of bulk water properties significantly\nmore accurately than commonly used rigid models: average error relative to\nexperiment is 0.76%. Close agreement with experiment holds over a wide range of\ntemperatures, well outside the ambient conditions at which the fit to\nexperiment was performed.

We\nillustrate this approach by showing that the quaternary Diophantine equation\n$x^{2n} \\pm 6 x^n+1=8 y^2$ has no solutions in positive integers $x$, $y$, $n$\nwith $x$, $n>1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2014 21:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

They consider locality-preserving operations which are\nimplemented by a constant depth geometrically local circuit and are thus\nfault-tolerant by construction. In particular, they shown that, for local\nstabilizer codes in D spatial dimensions, locality preserving gates are\nrestricted to a set of unitary gates known as the D-th level of the Clifford\nhierarchy. In this paper, we elaborate this idea and provide several extensions\nand applications of their characterization in various directions. First, we\npresent a new no-go theorem for self-correcting quantum memory. Namely, we\nprove that a three-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian with a\nlocality-preserving implementation of a non-Clifford gate cannot have a\nmacroscopic energy barrier. Second, we prove that the code distance of a\nD-dimensional local stabilizer code with non-trivial locality-preserving m-th\nlevel Clifford logical gate is upper bounded by $O(L^{D+1-m})$. For codes with\nnon-Clifford gates (m>2), this improves the previous best bound by Bravyi and\nTerhal. Third we prove that a qubit loss threshold of codes with non-trivial\ntransversal m-th level Clifford logical gate is upper bounded by 1/m. As such,\nno family of fault-tolerant codes with transversal gates in increasing level of\nthe Clifford hierarchy may exist. This result applies to arbitrary stabilizer\nand subsystem codes, and is not restricted to geometrically-local codes. Fourth\nwe extend the result of Bravyi and K\\\"onig to subsystem codes. A technical\ndifficulty is that, unlike stabilizer codes, the so-called union lemma does not\napply to subsystem codes. This problem is avoided by assuming the presence of\nerror threshold in a subsystem code, and the same conclusion as Bravyi-K\\\"onig\nis recovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2014 21:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

This wake\nmodel captures the effect of turbine positioning, while the \"top-down\" portion\nof the model adds the interactions between the wind-turbine wakes and the\natmospheric boundary layer. Each portion of the model requires specification of\na parameter that is not known a-priori. For the wake model, the wake expansion\ncoefficient is required, while the \"top-down\" model requires an effective\nspanwise turbine spacing within which the model's momentum balance is relevant.\nThe wake expansion coefficient is obtained by matching the predicted mean\nvelocity at the turbine from both approaches, while the effective spanwise\nturbine spacing depends on turbine positioning and thus can be determined from\nthe wake model.

We also study constraints from the\nspectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background and the big-bang\nnucleosynthesis. In addition, we show that the PeV neutrinos observed by the\nIceCube experiment can originate from the decay of a massive particle with its\nmass as large as O(10^10 GeV).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 01:43:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 09:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Despite its\nimportance, however, the full set of occultations has never received a\nconsistent, nor complete, analysis, and the results derived from the initial\nanalyses over thirty years ago left questions about the temperature and density\nprofiles unanswered. We have reanalyzed all six of the UVS occultations (three\nsolar and three stellar) to provide an up-to-date, pre-Cassini view of Saturn's\nupper atmosphere. From the Voyager UVS data, we have determined vertical\nprofiles for H2, H, CH4, C2H2 , C2H4, and C2H6, as well as temperature. Our\nanalysis also provides explanations for the two different thermospheric\ntemperatures derived in earlier analyses (400-450 K versus 800 K) and for the\nunusual shape of the total density profile noted by Hubbard et al. (1997).\nAside from inverting the occultation data to retrieve densities and\ntemperatures, we have investigated the atmospheric structure through a series\nof photochemical models to infer the strength of atmospheric mixing and other\nphysical and chemical properties of Saturn's mesopause region during the\nVoyager flybys. We find that the data exhibit considerable variability in the\nvertical profiles for methane, suggesting variations in vertical winds or the\neddy diffusion coefficient as a function of latitude and/or time in Saturn's\nupper atmosphere.

We then compare these with the Rayleigh\nindex. The receptivity analysis shows the regions of the flame where open-loop\ninjection of fuel or oxidizer will have most influence on the thermo-acoustic\noscillation. We find that the flame is most receptive at its tip. The\nbase-state sensitivity analysis shows the influence of each parameter on the\nfrequency/growth rate. We find that perturbations to the stoichiometric mixture\nfraction, the fuel slot width, and the heat-release parameter have most\ninfluence, while perturbations to the P\\'eclet number have least influence.\nThese sensitivities oscillate: e.g. positive perturbations to the fuel slot\nwidth either stabilizes or destabilizes the system, depending on the operating\npoint. This analysis reveals that, as expected from a simple model, the phase\ndelay between velocity and heat-release fluctuations is the key parameter in\ndetermining the sensitivities. It also reveals that this thermo-acoustic system\nis exceedingly sensitive to changes in the base state. The\nstructural-sensitivity analysis shows the influence of perturbations to the\nadvective flame velocity. The regions of highest sensitivity are around the\nstoichiometric line close to the inlet, showing where velocity models need to\nbe most accurate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 05:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-11"}

However,\nthe inferred mass distribution depends sensitively upon assumptions made on the\ndensity and the velocity anisotropy profiles of the tracers. Also, there is a\ndegeneracy between the parameters of the halo and that of the disk or bulge.\nHere, we decompose the Galaxy into bulge, disk and dark matter halo and then\nmodel the kinematic data of the halo BHB and K-giants from the SEGUE.\nAdditionally, we use the gas terminal velocity curve and the Sgr A$^*$ proper\nmotion. With $R_\\odot = 8.5$kpc, our study reveals that the density of the\nstellar halo has a break at $17.2^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$ kpc, and an exponential\ncut-off in the outer parts starting at $97.7^{+15.6}_{-15.8}$kpc. Also, we find\nthe velocity anisotropy is radially biased with $\\beta_s= 0.4\\pm{0.2}$ in the\nouter halo.

Recent progress in modelling these\nsignals relies on an approximate decoupling between the non-precessing secular\ninspiral and a precession-induced rotation. However, the latter depends in\ngeneral on all physical parameters of the binary which makes modelling efforts\nas well as understanding parameter-estimation prospects prohibitively complex.\nHere we show that the dominant precession effects can be captured by a reduced\nset of spin parameters. Specifically, we introduce a single \\emph{effective\nprecession spin} parameter, $\\chi_p$, which is defined from the spin components\nthat lie in the orbital plane at some (arbitrary) instant during the inspiral.\nWe test the efficacy of this parameter by considering binary inspiral\nconfigurations specified by the physical parameters of a corresponding\nnon-precessing-binary configuration (total mass, mass ratio, and spin\ncomponents (anti-)parallel to the orbital angular momentum), plus the effective\nprecession spin applied to the larger black hole. We show that for an\noverwhelming majority of random precessing configurations, the precession\ndynamics during the inspiral are well approximated by our equivalent\nconfigurations.

In Lasota et al. (2011), we proposed that the X-ray lightcurve is\nthe result of enhanced mass transfer episodes at periapsis from a donor star\norbiting the IMBH in a highly eccentric orbit. In this scenario, the delay can\nbe explained only if the orbital parameters can change suddenly from orbit to\norbit. To investigate this, we ran Newtonian smooth particle hydrodynamical\nsimulations starting with an incoming donor approaching an IMBH on a parabolic\norbit. We survey a large parameter space by varying the star-to-BH mass ratio\n($10^{-5}-10^{-3}$) and the periapsis separation $r_p$ from 2.2 to $2.7~r_t$\nwith $r_t$, the tidal radius. To model the donor, we choose several polytropes\n($\\Gamma = 5/2,~n=3/2$; $\\Gamma=3/2,~n=2$; $\\Gamma=5/3,~n=2$ & $n=3$).\n  Once the system is formed, the orbital period decreases until reaching a\nminimum. Then, the period tends to increase over several periapsis passages due\nto tidal effects and increasing mass transfer, leading ultimately to the\nejection of the donor. The development of stochastic fluctuations inside the\ndonor could lead to sudden changes in the orbital period from orbit to orbit\nwith the appropriate order of magnitude of what has been observed for HLX-1.\nGiven the constraints on the BH mass ($M_{\\rm BH} > 10^4~M_\\odot$) and assuming\nthat HLX-1 is currently near a minimum in period of $\\sim 1$ yr, the donor has\nto be a white dwarf or a stripped giant core. We predict that if HLX-1 is\nindeed emerging from a minimum in orbital period, then the period would\ngenerally increase with each passage, although substantial stochastic\nfluctuations can be superposed on this trend.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 11:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This derivation shows that the interaction between the host and\nthe impurity depends in a crucial way on the type of doubly occupied $t_{2g}$\norbital. One finds that in some cases, due to the quench of the orbital degree\nof freedom at the $3d$ impurity, the spin and orbital order within the host is\ndrastically modified by doping. The impurity acts either as a spin defect\naccompanied by an orbital vacancy in the spin-orbital structure when the\nhost-impurity coupling is weak, or it favors doubly occupied active orbitals\n(orbital polarons) along the $3d-4d$ bond leading to antiferromagnetic or\nferromagnetic spin coupling.

This\nso-called planet-metallicity correlation generally favors the idea that most\nobserved gas giants at $r<10$ AU are formed via a core accretion process. We\ninvestigate the origin of this phenomenon using a semi-analystical model,\nwherein the standard core accretion takes place at planet traps in protostellar\ndisks where rapid type I migrators are halted. We focus on the three major\nexoplanetary populations - hot-Jupiters, exo-Jupiters located at $r \\simeq 1$\nAU, and the low-mass planets. We show using a statistical approach that the\nplanet-metallicity correlations are well reproduced in these models. We find\nthat there are specific transition metallicities with values [Fe/H]$=-0.2$ to\n$-0.4$, below which the low-mass population dominates, and above which the\nJovian populations take over. The exo-Jupiters significantly exceed the\nhot-Jupiter population at all observed metallicities. The low-mass planets\nformed via the core accretion are insensitive to metallicity, which may account\nfor a large fraction of the observed super-Earths and hot-Neptunes. Finally, a\ncontrolling factor in building massive planets is the critical mass of\nplanetary cores ($M_{c,crit}$) that regulates the onset of runaway gas\naccretion. Assuming the current data is roughly complete at [Fe/H]$>-0.6$, our\nmodels predict that the most likely value of the \"mean\" critical core mass of\nJovian planets is $\\braket{M_{c,crit}} \\simeq 5 M_{\\oplus}$ rather than $10\nM_{\\oplus}$. This implies that grain opacities in accreting envelopes should\nplay an important role in lowering $M_{c,crit}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 13:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Our morphological studies imply\nthat, in addition to the supernova remnant SNR B0543-68.9 reported in previous\nstudies, a superbubble also overlaps the SNR in projection. The position of the\nSNR is clearly defined through the [SII]/H alpha flux ratio image. Moreover,\nthe optical images show a shell-like structure that is located farther to the\nnorth and is filled with diffuse X-ray emission, which again indicates the\nsuperbubble. Radio 21 cm line data show a shell around both objects. Radio\ncontinuum data show diffuse emission at the position of DEM L299, which appears\nclearly distinguished from the HII region N 164 that lies south-west of it. We\ndetermined the spectral index of SNR B0543-68.9 to be alpha=-0.34, which\nindicates the dominance of thermal emission and therefore a rather mature SNR.\nWe determined the basic properties of the diffuse X-ray emission for the SNR,\nthe superbubble, and a possible blowout region of the bubble, as suggested by\nthe optical and X-ray data. We obtained an age of 8.9 (3.5-18.1) kyr for the\nSNR and a temperature of 0.64 (0.44-1.37) keV for the hot gas inside the SNR,\nand a temperature of the hot gas inside the superbubble of 0.74 (0.44-1.1) keV.\nWe conclude that DEM L299 consists of a superposition of SNR B0543-68.9 and a\nsuperbubble, which we identified based on optical data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 13:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

This introduces the physical\nquestion of which one is the correct order; we then show that the two possible\norders of regularization (called I and II) are physically equivalent, as both\ncan typically reproduce the measured observables, but that the one with less\ndegrees of freedom (I) could be uniquely excluded by future experimental\nconstraints. This conclusion is based on the exact matching between the 4D and\n5D analytical calculations of the mass spectrum - via the regularizations of\ntype I and II. Beyond a deeper insight into the Higgs peak regularizations,\nthis matching also allows us to confirm the validity of the usual 5D\nmixed-formalism and to clarify the UV cut-off procedure. All the conclusions,\ndeduced from regularizing the Higgs peak through a brane shift or a smoothed\nsquare profile, are expected to remain similar in realistic models with a\nwarped extra-dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 13:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-09"}

A constant and\nparticle number independent energy gap of $\\sim$ 4 MeV between the $0^+$ ground\nstates and ${10}^+$ isomers and, the ${11/2}^-$ and ${27/2}^-$ isomers exists\nbefore the mid-shell, which declines near the mid-shell, and then becomes\nconstant at $\\sim$ 3 MeV after the mid-shell.

The\nrole of seniority, generalized seniority and alignment in the high-spin\nisomeric states as well as in the states populating the high spin isomers has\nbeen discussed. The empirical features suggest that the generalized seniority,\nknown to be valid in the low lying states of even-even nuclei before the\nmid-shell, remains good up to the ${10}^+$ isomeric states; we further extend\nthis interpretation to the odd-A nuclei before the mid-shell, particularly the\n${27/2}^-$ isomers.

We expanded the\n(local) matter density profile in terms of flexible interpolation schemes and\northonormal polynomials.

When these quantum corrections become large\nat low temperatures, the calculation of thermal conductivity demands a\ntheoretical approach that treats disorder and interactions on an equal footing.\nIn this paper, we develop such an approach by merging Luttinger's idea of using\ngravitational potentials for the analysis of thermal phenomena with a\nrenormalization group calculation based on the Keldysh nonlinear sigma model.\nThe gravitational potentials are introduced in the action as auxiliary sources\nthat couple to the heat density. These sources are a convenient tool for\ngenerating expressions for the heat density and its correlation function from\nthe partition function. Already in the absence of the gravitational potentials,\nthe nonlinear sigma model contains several temperature-dependent\nrenormalization group charges. When the gravitational potentials are introduced\ninto the model, they acquire an independent renormalization group flow. We show\nthat this flow preserves the phenomenological form of the correlation function,\nreflecting its relation to the specific heat and the constraints imposed by\nenergy conservation.

This result provides tentative evidence for\nthe acceleration of particles to relativistic energies due to the shock impact\nof this otherwise very low-power jet against the ambient medium. We calculate\nthe equipartition magnetic field strength (0.11 mG) and particle energy\n(4x10^40 erg), which are the minimum requirements to account for the\nsynchrotron emission of the DG Tau bow shock. These results suggest the\npossibility of low energy cosmic rays being generated by young Sun-like stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 15:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Are\nthese results extendable to radio-quiet (RQ) BAL quasars? Comparisons of RL and\nRQ BAL quasars show that many of their properties are quite similar. Here we\nextend these analyses to the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectral properties,\nusing a sample of 73 RL and 473 RQ BAL quasars selected from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS). Each RQ quasar is individually matched to a RL quasar in\nboth redshift (over the range $1.5 < z < 3.5$) and continuum luminosity. We\ncompare several continuum, emission line, and absorption line properties, as\nwell as physical properties derived from these measurements. Most properties in\nthe samples are statistically identical, though we find slight differences in\nthe velocity structure of the BALs that cause apparent differences in CIV\nemission line properties. Differences in the velocities may indicate an\ninteraction between the radio jets and the absorbing material. We also find\nthat UV FeII emission is marginally stronger in RL BAL quasars. All of these\ndifferences are subtle, so in general we conclude that RL and RQ BAL QSOs are\nnot fundamentally different objects, except in their radio properties. They are\ntherefore likely to be driven by similar physical phenomena, suggesting that\nresults from samples of RL BAL quasars can be extended to their RQ\ncounterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 15:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}
