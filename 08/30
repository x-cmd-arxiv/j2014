For the simulated tempering (SP) in\nparticular -- useful due to its generality and conceptual simplicity -- the\nlatter aspect (closely related to the actual $R$) may be a key issue in\nproblems displaying metastability and trapping in certain regions of the phase\nspace. To determine ${\\mathcal T}_R$'s leading to accurate thermodynamics\nestimates and still trying to minimize the simulation computational time, here\nit is considered a fixed exchange frequency scheme for the ST. From the\ntemperature of interest $T_1$, successive $T$'s are chosen so that the exchange\nfrequency between any adjacent pair $T_r$ and $T_{r+1}$ has a same value $f$.\nBy varying the $f$'s and analyzing the ${\\mathcal T}_R$'s through relatively\ninexpensive tests (e.g., time decay toward the steady regime), an optimal\nsituation in which the simulations visit much faster and more uniformly the\nrelevant portions of the phase space is determined. As illustrations, the\nproposal is applied to three lattice models, BEG, Bell-Lavis, and Potts, in the\nhard case of extreme first-order phase transitions, always giving very good\nresults, even for $R=3$. Also, comparisons with other protocols (constant\nentropy and arithmetic progression) to choose the set ${\\mathcal T}_R$ are\nundertaken. The fixed exchange frequency method is found to be consistently\nsuperior, specially for small $R$'s. Finally, distinct instances where the\nprescription could be helpful (in second-order transitions and for the parallel\ntempering approach) are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 17:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-01"}

These conditions foster intense convective downdrafts upon\nthe interaction of sub-saturated air in the elevated or sub-cloud mixed layer\nwith the storm precipitation core.

It is based on a statistical model of the function learned from\nprevious evaluations and an infill criterion - the expected improvement - used\nto find a promising point for a new evaluation. The `expected improvement'\ninfill criterion takes into account the mean and variance of a predictive\nmultivariate Gaussian distribution.\n  The expected improvement algorithm has recently been generalized to\nmultiobjective optimization. In order to measure the improvement of a Pareto\nfront quantitatively the gain in dominated (hyper-)volume is used. The\ncomputation of the expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) is a\nmultidimensional integration of a step-wise defined non-linear function related\nto the Gaussian probability density function over an intersection of boxes.\nThis paper provides a new algorithm for the exact computation of the expected\nimprovement to more than two objective functions. For the bicriteria case it\nhas a time complexity in $O(n^2)$ with $n$ denoting the number of points in the\ncurrent best Pareto front approximation. It improves previously known\nalgorithms with time complexity $O(n^3 \\log n)$. For tricriteria optimization\nwe devise an algorithm with time complexity of $O(n^3)$. Besides discussing the\nnew time complexity bounds the speed of the new algorithm is also tested\nempirically on test data. It is shown that further improvements in speed can be\nachieved by reusing data structures built up in previous iterations.

Furthermore,\nmore-massive galaxies tend to form the bulk of their stars at high redshift,\nwhich indicates that `downsizing' occurs in Illustris.

The first\nnew feature is a dark matter fluid, in the form of a scalar field with small\nequation of state and sound speed. This component is critical in reproducing\nthe success of cold dark matter for the expansion history and the growth of\nlinear perturbations, but does not cluster significantly on non-linear scales.\nInstead, the missing mass problem on non-linear scales is addressed by a\nmodification of the gravitational force law. The force law approximates MOND at\nlarge and intermediate accelerations, and therefore reproduces the empirical\nsuccess of MOND at fitting galactic rotation curves. At ultra-low\naccelerations, the force law reverts to an inverse-square-law, albeit with a\nlarger Newton's constant. This latter regime is important in galaxy clusters\nand is consistent with their observed isothermal profiles, provided the\ncharacteristic acceleration scale of MOND is mildly varying with scale or mass,\nsuch that it is ~12 times higher in clusters than in galaxies. We present an\nexplicit relativistic theory in terms of two scalar fields. The first scalar\nfield is governed by a Dirac-Born-Infeld action and behaves as a dark matter\nfluid on large scales. The second scalar field also has single-derivative\ninteractions and mediates a fifth force that modifies gravity on non-linear\nscales. Both scalars are coupled to matter via an effective metric that depends\nlocally on the fields. The form of this effective metric implies the equality\nof the two scalar gravitational potentials, which ensures that lensing and\ndynamical mass estimates agree.

We\nused spectroscopic observations acquired with VLT/X-shooter to determine the\nredshift and star-formation rate of the putative host galaxy. We compared the\nresults with the optical/IR spectral energy distribution obtained with\ndifferent facilities. Surprisingly, the host galaxy is a old and quiescent\nearly-type galaxy at z = 0.211 characterised by an unprecedentedly low specific\nstar-formation rate. It is the first LGRB host to be also an early-type\npost-starburst galaxy. This is further evidence that GRBs can explode in all\nkind of galaxies, with the only requirement being an episode of star-formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 20:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

The corresponding equations (expanding box model or EBM) have been\nconsidered earlier but never integrated in 3D simulations. Here, we follow the\ndevelopment of turbulence from 0.2 AU up to about 1.5 AU. Starting with\nisotropic spectra scaling as $k^{-1}$, we observe a steepening toward a\n$k^{-5/3}$ scaling in the middle of the wavenumber range and formation of\nspectral anisotropies. The advection of a plasma volume by the expanding solar\nwind causes a non-trivial stretching of the volume in directions transverse to\nradial and the selective decay of the components of velocity and magnetic\nfluctuations. These two effects combine to yield the following results. (i)\nSpectral anisotropy: gyrotropy is broken, and the radial wavevectors have most\nof the power. (ii) Coherent structures: radial streams emerge that resemble the\nobserved microjets. (iii) Energy spectra per component: they show an ordering\nin good agreement with the one observed in the solar wind at 1 AU. The latter\npoint includes a global dominance of the magnetic energy over kinetic energy in\nthe inertial and $f^{-1}$ range and a dominance of the\nperpendicular-to-the-radial components over the radial components in the\ninertial range.

The algorithm is then implemented into a\nCFD-DEM solver based on OpenFOAM and LAMMPS, the former being a\ngeneral-purpose, three-dimensional CFD solver based on unstructured meshes.\nNumerical simulations are performed for a fluidized bed by using the CFD-DEM\nsolver with the diffusion-based coarse-graining algorithm.

With an emphasis\non applications in electron microscopy, we simulate the behavior of probe\nparticles in an interaction-free measurement setup with semitransparent\nsamples, and we show that the transparency of a sample can be measured in such\na setup. However, such a measurement is not possible without losing (i.e.,\nabsorbing or scattering) probe particles in general, which causes sample\ndamage. We show how the amount of lost particles can be minimized by adjusting\nthe number of round trips through the setup, and we explicitly calculate the\namount of lost particles in measurements which either aim at distinguishing two\ntransparencies or at measuring an unknown transparency precisely. We also\ndiscuss the effect of the sample causing phase shifts in interaction-free\nmeasurements. Comparing the resulting loss of probe particles with a classical\nmeasurement of transparency, we find that interaction-free measurements only\nprovide a benefit in two cases: first, if two semitransparent samples with a\nhigh contrast are to be distinguished, interaction-free measurements lose less\nparticles than classical measurements by a factor that increases with the\ncontrast. This implies that interaction-free measurements with zero loss are\npossible if one of the samples is perfectly transparent. A second case where\ninteraction-free measurements outperform classical measurements is if three\nconditions are met: the particle source exhibits Poissonian number statistics,\nthe number of lost particles cannot be measured, and the transparency is larger\nthan approximately 1/2. In all other cases, interaction-free measurements lose\nas many probe particles as classical measurements or more.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 21:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

In a\nseries of papers we have traced the detailed structure of this region using\nopen star clusters, putting particular emphasis on the spiral structure of the\nouter disk. We noticed a conspicuous accumulation of young star clusters within\n2-3 kpc from the Sun and close to b=0, that we interpreted as the continuation\nof the Local (Orion) arm towards the outer disk. While most clusters (and young\nstars in their background) follow closely the warp of the disk, our decade-old\nsurvey of the spiral structure of this region led us to identify three\nclusters, Haffner~18(1 and 2) and Haffner~19, which remain very close to b=0\nand lie at distances (4.5, 8.0, and 6.4 kpc) where most of the material is\nalready significantly warped.

Internet technologies and services with network\nexternalities face a \"chicken and egg\" adoption problem in that the service\nrequires an established customer base in order to attract new customers. In\nthis paper we study cost subsidization as a means to \"reach the knee\", at which\npoint the externality drives rapid service adoption, and thereby change the\nequilibrium service fractional adoption level from an initial near-zero level\nto a final near-one level (full adoption). We present three simple subsidy\nmodels and evaluate them under two natural performance metrics: i) the duration\nrequired for the subsidized service to reach a given target adoption level, and\nii) the aggregate cost of the subsidy born by the service provide. First, we\npresent a \"two target adoption subsidy\" (TTAS) that subsidizes the cost so as\nto keep the fraction of users with positive net utility at a (constant) target\nlevel until the actual adoption target is reached. Second, we study a special\ncase of the above where the target ensures all users have positive net utility,\ncorresponding to a \"quickest adoption\" subsidy (QAS). Third, we introduce an\napproximation of QAS, called AQAS, that only requires the service provider\nadjust the subsidy level a prescribed number of times. Fourth, we study\nequilibria and their stability under uniformly and normally distributed user\nservice affinities, highlighting the unstable equilibrium in each case as the\nnatural target adoption level for the provider. Finally, we provide a fictional\ncase study to illustrate the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Aug 2014 06:48:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 May 2017 11:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-02"}

The necessity for high-bandwidth data links has made optical\ncommunication a critical constituent of modern information systems and silicon\nthe leading platform for creating the necessary optical components. While\nsilicon is arguably the most extensively studied material in history, one of\nits most important attributes, an analysis of its capacity to carry optical\ninformation, has not been reported. The calculation of the information capacity\nof silicon is complicated by nonlinear losses, phenomena that emerge in optical\nnanowires as a result of the concentration of optical power in a small\ngeometry. Nonlinear losses are absent in silica glass optical fiber and other\ncommon communication channels. While nonlinear loss in silicon is well known,\nnoise and fluctuations that arise from it have never been considered. Here we\nreport sources of fluctuations that arise from two-photon absorption and\nfree-carrier plasma effects and use these results to investigate the\ntheoretical limit of the information capacity of silicon. Our results show that\nnoise and fluctuations due to nonlinear absorption become significant and limit\nthe information capacity well before nonlinear loss itself becomes dominant.

A\nstar-like object is detected in both bands and the photometry indicates it has\nnegative (F225W - F336W) color. The observed object is compatible with the\ncompanion of the now-vanished yellow supergiant progenitor predicted in\ninteracting binary models. We consider it unlikely that the SN is undergoing\nstrong interaction and thus estimate that it makes a small contribution to the\nobserved flux. The possibilities of having detected an unresolved light echo or\nan unrelated object are briefly discussed and judged unlikely. Adopting a\npossible range of extinction by dust, we constrain parameters of the proposed\nbinary system. In particular, the efficiency of mass accretion onto the binary\ncompanion must be below 50%, if no significant extinction is produced by newly\nformed dust. Further multiband observations are required in order to confirm\nthe identification of the object as the companion star. If confirmed, the\ncompanion star would already be dominant in the UV/optical regime, so it would\nreadily provide a unique opportunity to perform a detailed study of its\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 20:00:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 10:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

After thorough\nanalysis and benchmarking against data, including the newest ones by the HARP\ncollaboration, both the exclusive and inclusive particle production models were\nfurther developed in the crucial for the above projects - but difficult from a\ntheoretical standpoint - projectile energy region of 0.7 to 12 GeV. At these\nenergies, modelling of prompt particle production in nucleon-nucleon and\npion-nucleon inelastic reactions is now based on a combination of phase-space\nand isobar models. Other reactions are still modeled in the framework of the\nQuark-Gluon String Model. Pion, kaon and strange particle production and\npropagation in nuclear media are improved. For the alternative inclusive mode,\nexperimental data on large-angle (> 20 degrees) pion production in\nhadron-nucleus interactions are parameterized in a broad energy range using a\ntwo-source model. It is mixed-and-matched with the native MARS model that\nsuccessfully describes low-angle pion production data. Predictions of both new\nmodels are - in most cases - in a good agreement with experimental data\nobtained at CERN, JINR, LANL, BNL and KEK.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 21:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-04"}

NMQSD is an open quantum\nsystem approach that incorporates environmental degrees of freedom (the\nvibrations in our case) in a stochastic way. We show in this paper that for\nlinear optical spectra (absorption, circular dichroism) no stochastics is\nneeded, even for finite temperatures. Thus, the spectra can be obtained by\npropagating a single trajectory. To this end we map a finite temperature\nenvironment to the zero temperature case using the so-called thermofield\nmethod.
