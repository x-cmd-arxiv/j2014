In contrast to conventional ergodic systems, many-body\nlocalized (MBL) systems are characterized by extensively many local integrals\nof motion (LIOM), which underlie the absence of transport and thermalization in\nthese systems. Here we report a physically motivated construction of local\nintegrals of motion in the MBL phase. We show that any local operator (e.g., a\nlocal particle number or a spin flip operator), evolved with the system's\nHamiltonian and averaged over time, becomes a LIOM in the MBL phase. Such\noperators have a clear physical meaning, describing the response of the MBL\nsystem to a local perturbation. In particular, when a local operator represents\na density of some globally conserved quantity, the corresponding LIOM describes\nhow this conserved quantity propagates through the MBL phase. Being uniquely\ndefined and experimentally measurable, these LIOMs provide a natural tool for\ncharacterizing the properties of the MBL phase, both in experiments and\nnumerical simulations. We demonstrate the latter by numerically constructing an\nextensive set of LIOMs in the MBL phase of a disordered spin chain model. We\nshow that the resulting LIOMs are quasi-local, and use their decay to extract\nthe localization length and establish the location of the transition between\nthe MBL and ergodic phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2014 16:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

The submanifolds being transversal to the internal\nspaces are realized as the external spaces and in fact identified as the usual\n$4$-dimensional world. The fundamental degrees of freedom determining the\ngeometrical dynamics of the bulk corresponding with short distance gravity are\ngiven by the gauge fields, the external metric field and the modulus fields\nsetting dynamically the volume of the internal spaces.

In two spacetime dimensions the chiral bosonization of the\nSchwinger model is determined by the axial current anomaly of massless Dirac\nfermions. A similar bosonized description applies to the 2D conformal trace\nanomaly of the fermion stress tensor. For both the chiral and conformal\nanomalies, correlation functions involving anomalous currents, $j^{\\mu}_5$ or\n$T^{\\mu\\nu}$ of massless fermions exhibit a massless boson $1/k^2$ pole, and\nthe associated spectral functions obey a UV finite sum rule, becoming\n$\\delta$-functions in the massless limit.

The boson has a\nFock space operator realization as a coherent superposition of massless fermion\npairs, which saturates the intermediate state sums in quantum correlation\nfunctions of fermion currents.

In detail, we\nshow how our approach provides an evolutionary and non-intrusive solution to\nthe scalability limitations of DPWS and experimentally evaluate it with an\nimplementation based on the the Web Services for Devices (WS4D) Java Multi\nEdition DPWS Stack (JMEDS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2014 19:57:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-01"}

Depending on the total initial mass of the system, and the NS\nequation of state (EOS), the post-merger phase can see a prompt collapse to a\nblack hole, or the formation of a supramassive NS, or even a stable NS. In the\ncase of post-merger NS (PMNS) formation, magnetic field amplification during\nthe merger will produce a magnetar with a large induced mass quadrupole moment,\nand millisecond spin. If the timescale for orthogonalization of the magnetic\nsymmetry axis with the spin axis is sufficiently short the NS will radiate its\nspin down energy primarily via GWs. Here we study this scenario for various\noutcomes of NS formation: we generalise the set of equilibrium states for a\ntwisted torus magnetic configuration to include solutions that, at a fixed\nexterior dipole field, carry a larger magnetic energy reservoir; we hence\ncompute their magnetic ellipticity and the strength of the expected GW signal\nas a function of the magnitude of the dipole and toroidal field. The relative\nnumber of GW detections from PMNSs and from binary NSs is a strong function of\nthe NS equation of state (EOS), being higher (~ 1%) for the stiffest EOSs and\nnegligibly small for the softest ones. For intermediate-stiffness EOSs, such as\nthe n=4/7 polytrope recently used by Giacomazzo \\& Perna or the GM1 used by\nLasky et al., the relative fraction is ~0.3%; correspondingly we estimate a GW\ndetection rate from stable PMNSs of ~ (0.1-1) yr$^{-1}$ with Advanced\ndetectors, and of ~ (100-1000) yr$^{-1}$ with third generation detectors such\nas the Einstein Telescope. Measurement of such GW signal would provide strong\nconstraints on the NS EOS and on the nature of the binary progenitors giving\nrise to SGRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2014 20:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The associated\nboson -- the hidden photon -- then interacts via kinetic mixing with the\nordinary photon. Such hidden photons arise naturally in UV extensions such as\nstring theory, often accompanied by the presence of extra spatial dimensions.\nIn this note we investigate a toy scenario where the hidden photon extends into\nthese extra dimensions. Interaction via kinetic mixing is observable only if\nthe hidden photon is massive. In four dimensions this mass needs to be\ngenerated via a Higgs or Stueckelberg mechanism. However, in a situation with\ncompactified extra dimensions there automatically exist massive Kaluza-Klein\nmodes which make the interaction observable. We present phenomenological\nconstraints for our toy model.

We propose that the primary cause of the\nextended cycle 23/24 minimum and weak cycle 24 was the weakness of cycle 23\nitself - with fewer sunspots, there was insufficient flux to build a big cycle.\nWe also find that any polar counter-cells in the meridional flow (equatorward\nflow at high latitudes) produce flux concentrations at mid-to-high latitudes\nthat are not consistent with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2014 21:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

While searching the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) for diffuse radio\nemission, we have serendipitously discovered extended radio emission close to\nthe Galactic plane.

Our aim is to confirm the presence of a previously unknown supernova\nremnant and to determine a possible association with the {\\gamma}-ray emission\n3EG J1744-3934.\n  Methods. We have conducted optical and radio follow-ups of the target using\nthe Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo\nInter-American Observatory (CTIO) and the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope\n(GMRT). We then combined these data with archival radio and {\\gamma}-ray\nobservations.\n  Results. While we detected the extended emission in four different radio\nbands (325, 1400, 2417, and 4850 MHz), no optical counterpart has been\nidentified. Given its morphology and brightness, it is likely that the radio\nemission is caused by an old supernova remnant no longer visible in the optical\nband. Although an unclassified EGRET source is co-located with the supernova\nremnant, Fermi-LAT data do not show a significant {\\gamma}-ray excess that is\ncorrelated with the radio emission. However, in the radial distribution of the\n{\\gamma}-ray events, a spatially extended feature is related with SNR at a\nconfidence level $\\sim 1.5$ {\\sigma}.\n  Conclusions. We classify the newly discovered extended emission in the radio\nband as the old remnant of a previously unknown Galactic supernova: SNR\nG351.0-5.4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2014 21:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

In order to further clarify the\nnature of these spacetimes, we address this question: do there exist bound\nparticle and photon orbits in McVittie spacetimes? Considering first circular\nphoton orbits, we obtain an explicit characterization of all McVittie\nspacetimes for which such orbits exist: there is a 2-parameter class of such\nspacetimes, and so the existence of a circular photon orbit is a highly\nspecialised feature of a McVittie spacetime. However, we prove that in two\nlarge classes of McVittie spacetimes, there are bound particle and photon\norbits: future-complete non-radial timelike and null geodesics along which the\nareal radius $r$ has a finite upper bound. These geodesics are asymptotic at\nlarge times to circular orbits of a corresponding Schwarzschild or\nSchwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. The existence of these geodesics lays the\nfoundations for and shows the theoretical possibility of the formation of\naccretion disks in McVittie spacetimes.

Our proposed TBM naturally\nsupports the following types: Gaussian, intervals, censored, binary,\ncategorical, muticategorical, ordinal, (in)-complete rank with and without\nties.

They provide useful technical tools for studying\ntheir structure. In this paper we define one of the dimensions called\ncouniserial dimension that measures how close a ring or module is to being\nuniform. Despite their different objectives, it turns out that there are\ncertain common properties between the couniserial dimension and Krull dimension\nlike each module having such a dimension contains a uniform submodule and has\nfinite uniform dimension, among others. Like all dimensions, this is an ordinal\nvalued invariant. Every module of finite length has couniserial dimension and\nits value lies between the uniform dimension and the length of the module.\nModules with countable couniserial dimension are shown to possess\nindecomposable decomposition. In particular, von Neumann regular ring with\ncountable couniserial dimension is semisimple artinian. If the maximal right\nquotient ring of a non-singular ring R has a couniserial dimension as an\nR-module, then R is a semiprime right Goldie ring. As one of the applications,\nit follows that all right R-modules have couniserial dimension if and only if R\nis a semisimple artinian ring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2014 00:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-04"}

Such\nsolutions envision non-traditional communication scenarios, such as disaster\nareas and development regions. Several forwarding algorithms have been\ninvestigated, aiming to offer the best trade-off between cost (number of\nmessage replicas) and rate of successful message delivery. Among such\nproposals, there has been an effort to employ social similarity inferred from\nuser mobility patterns in opportunistic routing solutions to improve\nforwarding. However, these research effort presents two major limitations:\nfirst, it is focused on distribution of the intercontact time over the complete\nnetwork structure, ignoring the impact that human behavior has on the dynamics\nof the network; and second, most of the proposed solutions look at challenging\nnetworking environments where networks have low density, ignoring the potential\nuse of delay-tolerant networking to support low cost communications in networks\nwith higher density, such as urban scenarios.

The main idea is the characterisation of\nsymbiotic relations of coexisting species through their mutual influence on\ntheir respective carrying capacities, taking into account that this influence\ncan be quite strong and requires a nonlinear functional framework. We\ndistinguish three variants of mutual influence, representing the main types of\nrelations between species: (i) passive symbiosis, when the mutual carrying\ncapacities are influenced by other species without their direct interactions;\n(ii) active symbiosis, when the carrying capacities are transformed by\ninteracting species; and (iii) mixed symbiosis, when the carrying capacity of\none species is influenced by direct interactions, while that of the other\nspecies is not. The approach allows us to describe all kinds of symbiosis,\nmutualism, commensalism, and parasitism within a unified scheme. The case of\ntwo symbiotic species is analysed in detail, demonstrating several dynamical\nregimes of coexistence, unbounded growth of both populations, growth of one and\nelimination of the other population, convergence to evolutionary stable states,\nand everlasting population oscillations. The change of the dynamical regimes\noccurs by varying the system parameters characterising the destruction or\ncreation of the mutual carrying capacities. The regime changes are associated\nwith several dynamical system bifurcations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2014 09:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

At the beginning of a visit of the server to such a queue, a gate is\nset behind all customers. High priority customers receive priority in the sense\nthat they are always served before any low priority customers. But high\npriority customers have a second advantage over low priority customers. Low\npriority customers are served according to the gated service discipline, i.e.\nonly customers standing in front of the gate are served during this visit. In\ncontrast, high priority customers arriving during the visit period of the queue\nare allowed to pass the gate and all low priority customers before the gate.\n  We study the cycle time distribution, the waiting time distributions for each\ncustomer type, the joint queue length distribution of all priority classes at\nall queues at polling epochs, and the steady-state marginal queue length\ndistributions for each customer type. Through numerical examples we illustrate\nthat the mixed gated/exhaustive service discipline can significantly decrease\nwaiting times of high priority jobs.

For densities higher than\n\\sim10^5 cm-3, shattering becomes a self-enhanced process that imposes severe\nchemical and dynamical consequences on the shock characteristics. Shattering is\naccompanied by the vaporization of grains, which can directly release SiO to\nthe gas phase. Given that SiO rotational line radiation is used as a major\ntracer of shocks in dense clouds, it is crucial to understand the influence of\nvaporization on SiO line emission. We have developed a recipe for implementing\nthe effects of shattering and vaporization into a 2-fluid shock model,\nresulting in a reduction of computation time by a factor \\sim100 compared to a\nmulti-fluid modelling approach. This implementation was combined with an\nLVG-based modelling of molecular line radiation transport. Using this model we\ncalculated grids of shock models to explore the consequences of different\ndust-processing scenarios. Grain-grain processing is shown to have a strong\ninfluence on C-type shocks for a broad range of magnetic fields: they become\nhotter and thinner. The reduction in column density of shocked gas lowers the\nintensity of molecular lines, at the same time as higher peak temperatures\nincrease the intensity of highly excited transitions compared to shocks without\ngrain-grain processing. For OH the net effect is an increase in line\nintensities, while for CO and H2O it is the contrary. The intensity of H2\nemission is decreased in low transitions and increased for highly excited\nlines. For all molecules, the highly excited lines become sensitive to the\nvalue of the magnetic field. Although vaporization increases the intensity of\nSiO rotational lines, this effect is weakened by the reduced shock width. The\nrelease of SiO early in the hot shock changes the excitation characteristics of\nSiO radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2014 11:55:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-04"}

Resurfacing mechanics has become a new focus for asteroid\nresearchers due to its important implications for interpreting surface\nobservations, including space weathering effects. This paper provides a\nprediction for the tidal effects during the 2029 encounter, with an emphasis on\nwhether surface refreshing due to regolith movement will occur. The potential\nshape modification of the object due to the tidal encounter is first confirmed\nto be negligibly small with systematic simulations, thus only the external\nperturbations are taken into account for this work (despite this, seismic\nshaking induced by shifting blocks might still play a weak role and we will\nlook into this mechanism in future work). A two-stage approach is developed to\nmodel the responses of asteroid surface particles (the regolith) based on the\nsoft-sphere implementation of the parallel N-body gravity tree code pkdgrav. A\nfull-body model of Apophis is sent past the Earth on the predicted trajectory\nto generate the data of all forces acting at a target point on the surface. A\nsandpile constructed in the local frame is then used to approximate the\nregolith materials; all the forces the sandpile feels during the encounter are\nimposed as external perturbations to mimic the regolith's behavior in the full\nscenario. The local mechanical environment on the asteroid surface is\nrepresented in detail, leading to an estimation of the change in global surface\nenvironment due to the encounter.

To address these challenges, we first\nextend one dimensional functional principal component analysis to the two\ndimensional functional principle component analyses (2DFPCA) to fully capture\nspace variation of image signals. Image signals contain a large number of\nredundant and irrelevant features which provide no additional or no useful\ninformation for cluster analysis. Widely used methods for removing redundant\nand irrelevant features are sparse clustering algorithms using a lasso-type\npenalty to select the features. However, the accuracy of clustering using a\nlasso-type penalty depends on how to select penalty parameters and a threshold\nfor selecting features. In practice, they are difficult to determine. Recently,\nrandomized algorithms have received a great deal of attention in big data\nanalysis. This paper presents a randomized algorithm for accurate feature\nselection in image cluster analysis.

This increased rate of information flow to the UP, together with\nits many potential benefits, raise important concerns regarding user privacy.\nThis work investigates, from an information theoretic perspective, the privacy\nthat can be achieved in a multi-user SM system in the presence of an\nalternative energy source (AES). To measure privacy, we use the mutual\ninformation rate between the users' real energy consumption profile and the SM\nreadings that are available to the UP. The objective is to characterize the\n\\textit{privacy-power function}, defined as the minimal information leakage\nrate that can be obtained with an average power limited AES. We characterize\nthe privacy-power function in a single-letter form when the users' energy\ndemands are assumed to be independent and identically distributed over time.\nMoreover, for binary and exponentially distributed energy demands, we provide\nan explicit characterization of the privacy-power function. For any discrete\nenergy demands, we demonstrate that the privacy-power function can always be\nefficiently evaluated numerically. Finally, for continuous energy demands, we\nderive an explicit lower-bound on the privacy-power function, which is tight\nfor exponentially distributed loads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2014 15:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-04"}

We consider different covariant couplings of this Galileon scalar\nfield with the matter field: the conformal coupling, the disformal coupling and\nthe longitudinal coupling.

We\nconjecture that the hyperplane arrangement of any $\\vee$-system is free in\nSaito's sense and show this for all known $\\vee$-systems and for a special\nclass of $\\vee$-systems called harmonic, which includes all Coxeter systems. In\nthe irreducible Coxeter case the potentials of the corresponding gradient\nvector fields turn out to be Saito flat coordinates, or their one-parameter\ndeformations. We give formulas for these deformations as well as for the\npotentials of the classical families of harmonic $\\vee$-systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Jul 2014 22:37:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2015 23:55:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 18:10:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-17"}
