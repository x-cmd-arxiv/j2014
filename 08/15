A method to investigate the host galaxies of high luminosity quasars\nis to obtain optical spectra at positions offset from the nucleus where the\nrelative contribution of the quasar and host are comparable. However, at these\nextended radii the galaxy surface brightness is often low (20-22 mag per\narcsec$^{2}$) and the resulting spectrum might have such low S/N that it\nhinders analysis with standard stellar population modeling techniques.

We find explicit analytical solutions of the\nbound states and their energies for certain parameter regimes such as weak and\nstrong SOI. The analytical results are confirmed and complemented by an\nindependent numerical tight-binding model approach. Such FBS can act as\nquasiparticle traps and thus can have implications for topological quantum\ncomputing schemes based on braiding MBSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 17:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We show that, in this particular setting, the most\ngeneral adaptive discrimination strategies provide no asymptotic advantage over\nnon-adaptive tensor-power strategies. This conclusion follows by proving a\nquantum Stein's lemma for this channel discrimination setting, showing that a\nconstant bound on the Type I error leads to the Type II error decreasing to\nzero exponentially quickly at a rate determined by the maximum relative entropy\nregistered between the channels. The strong converse part of the lemma states\nthat any attempt to make the Type II error decay to zero at a rate faster than\nthe channel relative entropy implies that the Type I error necessarily\nconverges to one. We then refine this latter result by identifying the optimal\nstrong converse exponent for this task. As a consequence of these results, we\ncan establish a strong converse theorem for the quantum-feedback-assisted\ncapacity of a channel, sharpening a result due to Bowen. Furthermore, our\nchannel discrimination result demonstrates the asymptotic optimality of a\nnon-adaptive tensor-power strategy in the setting of quantum illumination, as\nwas used in prior work on the topic. The sandwiched Renyi relative entropy is a\nkey tool in our analysis.

Controlling these oscillatory dynamics quickly relative to\nthe vacuum Rabi frequency enables remarkable capabilities such as Fock state\ngeneration and deterministic synthesis of quantum states of light, as\ndemonstrated using microwave frequency devices. At optical frequencies,\nhowever, dynamical control of single-atom vacuum Rabi oscillations remains\nchallenging. Here, we demonstrate coherent transfer of optical frequency\nexcitation between a single quantum dot and a cavity by controlling vacuum Rabi\noscillations. We utilize a photonic molecule to simultaneously attain strong\ncoupling and a cavity-enhanced AC Stark shift. The Stark shift modulates the\ndetuning between the two systems on picosecond timescales, faster than the\nvacuum Rabi frequency. We demonstrate the ability to add and remove excitation\nfrom the cavity, and perform coherent control of light-matter states. These\nresults enable ultra-fast control of atom-cavity interactions in a nanophotonic\ndevice platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 18:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-31"}

Construction of an\nadaptive optimal solution for such problems usually relies either on a singular\nvalue decomposition or representation of the solution via an orthonormal basis.\nThe shortcoming of both approaches lies in the fact that, in many situations,\nneither the eigenbasis of the linear operator nor a standard orthonormal basis\nconstitutes an appropriate collection of functions for sparse representation of\nthe unknown function. In the context of regression problems, there have been an\nenormous amount of effort to recover an unknown function using an overcomplete\ndictionary. One of the most popular methods, Lasso, is based on minimizing the\nempirical likelihood and requires stringent assumptions on the dictionary, the,\nso called, compatibility conditions. While these conditions may be satisfied\nfor the original dictionary functions, they usually do not hold for their\nimages due to contraction imposed by the linear operator. In what follows, we\nbypass this difficulty by a novel approach which is based on inverting each of\nthe dictionary functions and matching the resulting expansion to the true\nfunction, thus, avoiding unrealistic assumptions on the dictionary and using\nLasso in a predictive setting. We examine both the white noise and the\nobservational model formulations and also discuss how exact inverse images of\nthe dictionary functions can be replaced by their approximate counterparts.\nFurthermore, we show how the suggested methodology can be extended to the\nproblem of estimation of a mixing density in a continuous mixture. For all the\nsituations listed above, we provide the oracle inequalities for the risk in a\nfinite sample setting. Simulation studies confirm good computational properties\nof the Lasso-based technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 19:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2015 17:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-03"}

With the ability to gate-modulate\nsurface conduction by more than 25%, this approach provides promise for both\nfundamental and applied studies of gate-tuned devices structured on bulk\ncrystal samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 19:43:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 18:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-06"}

In this paper, we\npropose that an ultrafast reduction in the exchange interaction by a\nfemtosecond laser pulse is mainly responsible for demagnetization and spin\nswitching. The key physics is that the dipole selection rule demands two\ndistinctive electron configurations for the ground and excited states and\nconsequently changes the exchange interaction. Although the exchange\ninteraction change is almost instantaneous, its effect on the spin is delayed\nby the finite spin wave propagation. Consistent with the experimental\nobservation, the delay becomes longer with a stronger exchange interaction\npulse. In spin-frustrated systems, the effect of the exchange interaction\nchange is even more dramatic, where the spin can be directly switched from one\ndirection to the other. Therefore, our theory has the potential to explain the\nessence of major observations in rare-earth transition metal compounds for the\nlast seven years.

We argue that\nthe notion of identity is fundamental to surveillance. Rather than having a\nsingle identity, individuals have many identities, real and virtual, that are\nused in different aspects of their lives. Most aspects of life are subject to\nsome form of surveillance, and observations and identities can be aggregated.\nThe notion of identity needs to be theorised.

Travel times on road traffic networks are stochastic, highly\nvariable, and dependent on several parameters. It is, therefore, necessary to\nhave good indicators and measures of their variations. In this article, we\nextend a recent approach for the derivation of deterministic bounds on the\ntravel time in a road traffic network (Farhi, Haj-Salem and Lebacque 2013). The\napproach consists in using an algebraic formulation of the cell-transmission\ntraffic model on a ring road, where the car-dynamics is seen as a linear\nmin-plus system. The impulse response of the system is derived analytically,\nand is interpreted as what is called a service curve in the network calculus\ntheory (where the road is seen as a server). The basic results of the latter\ntheory are then used to derive an upper bound for the travel time through the\nring road.\n  We consider in this article open systems rather than closed ones. We define a\nset of elementary traffic systems and an operator for the concatenation of such\nsystems. We show that the traffic system of any road itinerary can be built by\nconcatenating a number of elementary traffic systems. The concatenation of\nsystems consists in giving a service guarantee of the resulting system in\nfunction of service guarantees of the composed systems. We illustrate this\napproach with a numerical example, where we compute an upper bound for the\ntravel time on a given route in a urban network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 00:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-18"}

On one hand, the annotations often contain\ncontaminated information, where a small fraction of label flips might ruin the\nglobal ranking of the whole dataset.

The amount of channel variation is\nrelated to the normalized Doppler shift which is a function of user's mobility.\nThe Doppler shift is used to distinguish between slow time-varying\n(slow-fading) and rapid time-varying (fast-fading) channels. The performance of\nseveral important relay topologies, including single-branch and multi-branch\ndual-hop relaying with/without a direct link that employ amplify-and-forward\nrelaying and two-symbol non-coherent detection, is analyzed. For this purpose,\na time-series model is developed for characterizing the time-varying nature of\nthe cascaded channel encountered in amplify-and-forward relaying.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 06:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-18"}

Neutrino losses from\nproto-neutron stars play a crucial role in deciding whether these stars would\nbe crushed into black holes or explode as supernovae. Both pure leptonic and\nweak-interaction processes contribute to the neutrino energy losses in stellar\nmatter. At low temperatures and densities, characteristic of the early phase of\npresupernova evolution, cooling through neutrinos produced via the\nweak-interaction is important. Proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase\napproximation (pn-QRPA) theory has recently being used for calculation of\nstellar weak-interaction rates of $fp$-shell nuclide with success. The\nlepton-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{e}$) during early phases of stellar evolution of\nmassive stars changes substantially alone due to electron captures on\n$^{56}$Ni. The stellar matter is transparent to the neutrinos produced during\nthe presupernova evolution of massive stars.

In our global model, windows of increased immigration\nmap to the seasonal timing of epidemic spread, while windows of increased\nemigration map to epidemic decline.

Specifically, the\ncommunication system is modeled as a MIMO transceiver, which consists of three\nparts: an encoder, a MIMO channel, and a decoder. In the spirit of MIMO\ncommunication, the number of SISO subchannels in the transceiver is often\ngreater than the number of data streams to be transmitted. Moreover, the\nsubchannel capacities are assumed to be fixed a priori. In this case, the\nencoder/decoder pair gives an additional design freedom on top of the\ncontroller, leading to a stabilization problem via coding/control co-design. It\nturns out that how to take the best advantage of the coding mechanism is quite\ncrucial.

High concentrations\nof solar wind-like He and Ne found in most grains indicate that they were\ndelivered to Earth as micrometeoritic dust, while their abundance,\nstratigraphic position and major element composition indicate an origin related\nto the L chondrite parent body (LCPB) break-up event, 470 Ma ago. Compared to\nsediment-dispersed extraterrestrial chromite (SEC) grains extracted from coeval\nsediments at other localities, the grains from Lynna River are both highly\nconcentrated and well preserved. As in previous work, in most grains from Lynna\nRiver, high concentrations of solar wind-derived He and Ne impede a clear\nquantification of cosmic-ray produced He and Ne. However, we have found several\nSEC grains poor in solar wind Ne, showing a resolvable contribution of\ncosmogenic 21Ne. This makes it possible, for the first time, to determine\nrobust cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages in these fossil micrometeorites, on the\norder of a few hundred-thousand years. These ages are similar to the CRE ages\nmeasured in chromite grains from cm-sized fossil meteorites recovered from\ncoeval sediments in Sweden. As the CRE ages are shorter than the orbital decay\ntime of grains of this size by Poynting-Robertson drag, this suggests that the\ngrains were delivered to Earth through direct injection into an orbital\nresonance. We demonstrate how CRE ages of fossil micrometeorites can be used,\nin principle, to determine sedimentation rates, and to correlate the sediments\nat Lynna River with the fossil meteorite-bearing sediment layers in Sweden.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 12:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-18"}

The detailed investigation of the short-period\nand low-amplitude pulsations of these relatively faint targets requires\nconsiderable observational efforts from the ground, long-term single-site or\nmultisite observations. The observed amplitudes of excited modes undergo\nshort-term variations in many cases, which makes the determination of pulsation\nmodes difficult.\n  Methods: We re-analysed the data already published, and collected new\nmeasurements. We compared the frequency content of the different datasets from\nthe different epochs and performed various tests to check the reliability of\nthe frequency determinations. The mean period spacings were investigated with\nlinear fits to the observed periods, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Inverse Variance\nsignificance tests, and Fourier analysis of different period sets, including a\nMonte Carlo test simulating the effect of alias ambiguities. We employed fully\nevolutionary DB white dwarf models for the asteroseismic investigations.\n  Results: We identified 22 frequencies between 1280 and 2530 microHz. These\nform 12 groups, which suggests at least 12 possible frequencies for the\nasteroseismic investigations. Thanks to the extended observations, KUV\n05134+2605 joined the group of rich white dwarf pulsators. We identified one\ntriplet and at least one doublet with a ~9 microHz frequency separation, from\nwhich we derived a stellar rotation period of 0.6 d. We determined the mean\nperiod spacings of ~31 and ~18 s for the modes we propose as dipole and\nquadrupole, respectively. We found an excellent agreement between the stellar\nmass derived from the l=1 period spacing and the period-to-period fits, all\nproviding M_* = 0.84-0.85 M_Sun solutions. Our study suggests that KUV\n05134+2605 is the most massive amongst the known V777 Her stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 15:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}
