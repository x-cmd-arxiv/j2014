We show that under these considerations, the\nKlein-Gordon equation actually becomes a stochastic differential equation.\nTherefore, the existence and uniqueness of solutions to Einstein's equations\ndepend on whether the coefficients of this stochastic differential equation\nobey Lipschitz continuity conditions. We show that for any choice of $V(\\phi)$,\nthe Einstein field equations are not globally well-posed, hence, any solution\nfound to these equations is not guaranteed to be unique. Instead, the\ncoefficients are at best locally Lipschitz continuous in the physical state\nspace of the dynamical variables, which only exist up to a finite explosion\ntime. We further perform Feller's explosion test for an arbitrary power-law\ninflaton potential and prove that all solutions to the EFE explode in a finite\ntime with probability one. This implies that the mechanism of stochastic\ninflation thus considered cannot be described to be eternal, since the very\nconcept of eternal inflation implies that the process continues indefinitely.\nWe therefore argue that stochastic inflation based on a stochastic forcing term\nwould not produce an infinite number of universes in some multiverse ensemble.\nIn general, since the Einstein field equations in both situations are not\nwell-posed, we further conclude that the existence of a multiverse via the\nstochastic eternal inflation mechanism considered in this paper is still very\nmuch an open question that will require much deeper investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Aug 2014 16:11:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 18:10:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 Aug 2014 21:32:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 13 Dec 2014 22:33:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 14:48:58 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2016 15:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

A key property that allows to\nstudy the statistical implications of such approximations is that of Fisher\nconsistency. Fisher consistency is a desirable property for surrogate loss\nfunctions and implies that in the population setting, i.e., if the probability\ndistribution that generates the data were available, then optimization of the\nsurrogate would yield the best possible model. In this paper we will\ncharacterize the Fisher consistency of a rich family of surrogate loss\nfunctions used in the context of ordinal regression, including support vector\nordinal regression, ORBoosting and least absolute deviation. We will see that,\nfor a family of surrogate loss functions that subsumes support vector ordinal\nregression and ORBoosting, consistency can be fully characterized by the\nderivative of a real-valued function at zero, as happens for convex\nmargin-based surrogates in binary classification. We also derive excess risk\nbounds for a surrogate of the absolute error that generalize existing risk\nbounds for binary classification. Finally, our analysis suggests a novel\nsurrogate of the squared error loss. We compare this novel surrogate with\ncompeting approaches on 9 different datasets. Our method shows to be highly\ncompetitive in practice, outperforming the least squares loss on 7 out of 9\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 06:52:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 11:26:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2014 15:56:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 10:38:59 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2015 10:43:35 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2015 08:56:31 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2015 08:44:54 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 18:20:16 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 05:50:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-24"}

The R_blr-L\nrelation arises from simple photoionization considerations. Using a general\nrelativistic model of an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk, we\nshow that the ionizing luminosity jointly depends on black hole mass, accretion\nrate, and spin. The non-monotonic relation between the ionizing and optical\nluminosity gives rise to a complicated relation between the BLR size and the\noptical luminosity. We show that the reverberation lag of Hbeta to the varying\ncontinuum depends very sensitively to black hole spin. For retrograde spins,\nthe disk is so cold that there is a deficit of ionizing photons in the BLR,\nresulting in shrinkage of the hydrogen ionization front with increasing optical\nluminosity, and hence shortened Hbeta lags. This effect is specially striking\nfor luminous quasars undergoing retrograde accretion, manifesting in strong\ndeviations from the canonical R_blr-L relation. This could lead to a method to\nestimate black hole spins of quasars and to study their cosmic evolution. At\nthe same time, the small scatter of the observed R_blr-L relation for the\ncurrent sample of reverberation-mapped active galaxies implies that the\nmajority of these sources have rapidly spinning black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 07:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

It is demonstrated that if a kink passes the defect, it always\nrestores its initial momentum and energy and the only effect of the interaction\nwith the defect is a phase shift of the kink. A kink approaching the defect\nfrom the gain side always passes, while in the opposite case it must have\nsufficiently large initial momentum to pass through the defect instead of being\ntrapped in the loss region. The kink phase shift and critical velocity are\ncalculated with the use of the collective variable method. Kink-kink\n(kink-antikink) collisions at the defect are also briefly considered, showing\nhow their pairwise repulsive (respectively, attractive) interaction can modify\nthe collisional outcome of a single kink within the pair with the defect. For\nthe breather, the result of its interaction with the defect strongly depends on\nthe breather parameters (velocity, frequency and initial phase) and on the\ndefect parameters. The breather can gain some energy from the defect and as a\nresult potentially even split into a kink-antikink pair or it can lose a part\nof its energy. Interestingly, the breather translational mode is very weakly\naffected by the dissipative perturbation, so that a breather penetrates more\neasily through the defect when it comes from the lossy side, than a kink. In\nall studied soliton-defect interactions the energy loss to radiation of\nsmall-amplitude extended waves is negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 09:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-06"}

We find that\n14% of the quiet Sun flux is in the form of internetwork fields, with little\ntemporal variations. Internetwork elements interact with network patches and\nmodify the flux budget of the network, either by adding flux (through merging\nprocesses) or by removing it (through cancellation events). Mergings appear to\nbe dominant, so the net flux contribution of the internetwork is positive. The\nobserved rate of flux transfer to the network is 1.5 x 10^24 Mx day^-1 over the\nentire solar surface. Thus, the internetwork supplies as much flux as is\npresent in the network in only 9-13 hours. Taking into account that not all the\ntransferred flux is incorporated into the network, we find that the\ninternetwork would be able to replace the entire network flux in approximately\n18-24 hours.

The reason for the turbulence-enabled disk formation is\nusually attributed to the turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection, which is\nthought to reduce the magnetic flux accumulated in the disk-forming region. We\nadvance an alternative interpretation, based on magnetic decoupling-triggered\nreconnection of severely pinched field lines close to the central protostar and\nturbulence-induced warping of the pseudodisk of Galli and Shu. Such\nreconnection weakens the central split magnetic monopole that lies at the heart\nof the magnetic braking catastrophe under flux freezing. We show, through\nidealized numerical experiments, that the pseudodisk can be strongly warped,\nbut not completely destroyed, by a subsonic or sonic turbulence. The warping\ndecreases the rates of angular momentum removal from the pseudodisk by both\nmagnetic torque and outflow, making it easier to form a rotationally supported\ndisk. More importantly, the warping of the pseudodisk out of the disk-forming,\nequatorial plane greatly reduces the amount of magnetic flux threading the\ncircumstellar, disk-forming region, further promoting disk formation. The\nbeneficial effects of pseudodisk warping can also be achieved by a misalignment\nbetween the magnetic field and rotation axis. These two mechanisms of disk\nformation, enabled by turbulence and field-rotation misalignment respectively,\nare thus unified. We find that the disks formed in turbulent magnetized cores\nare rather thick and significantly magnetized.

Simply applying image-based warping algorithms to video-based\nface editing produces temporal incoherence in the synthesized videos because it\nis impossible to consistently localize facial features in two frames\nrepresenting two different faces in two different videos (or even two\nconsecutive frames representing the same face in one video). Therefore, high\nperformance face editing usually requires significant manual manipulation. In\nthis paper we propose a novel temporal-spatial-smooth warping (TSSW) algorithm\nto effectively exploit the temporal information in two consecutive frames, as\nwell as the spatial smoothness within each frame. TSSW precisely estimates two\ncontrol lattices in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively from\nthe corresponding control lattices in the previous frame, by minimizing a novel\nenergy function that unifies a data-driven term, a smoothness term, and feature\npoint constraints. Corresponding warping surfaces then precisely map source\nframes to the target frames. Experimental testing on facial attractiveness\nenhancement, makeup transfer, face replacement, and expression manipulation\ndemonstrates that the proposed approaches can effectively preserve spatial\nsmoothness and temporal coherence in editing facial geometry, skin detail,\nidentity, and expression, which outperform the existing face editing methods.\nIn particular, TSSW is robust to subtly inaccurate localization of feature\npoints and is a vast improvement over image-based warping methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 11:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-12"}

Comparison of the UVOT grism spectra of\nSN~2014J with Hubble Space Telescope observations of SN2011fe or UVOT grism\nspectra of SN~2012fr are consistent with an extinction law with a low value of\nR_V~1.4. The high reddening causes the detected photon distribution in the\nbroadband UV filters to have a much longer effective wavelength than for an\nunreddened SN. The light curve evolution is consistent with this shift and does\nnot show a flattening due to photons being scattered back into the line of\nsight. The light curve shapes and color evolution are inconsistent with a\ncontribution scattered into the line of sight by circumstellar dust. We\nconclude that most or all of the high reddening must come from interstellar\ndust.

It has remained\nopen to define a suitable spectral model for hypergraphs whose spectra can be\nused to estimate various combinatorial properties of the hypergraph.\n  In this paper we introduce a new hypergraph Laplacian operator (generalizing\nthe Laplacian matrix of graphs)and study its spectra.

A new approach for internal image\nrepresentation is outlined together with two new interfaces:\nclassical-to-quantum and quantum-to-classical. The new quantum-Boolean image\ndenoising called quantum Boolean mean filter (QBMF) works with computational\nbasis states (CBS), exclusively. To achieve this, we first decompose the image\ninto its three color components, i.e., red, green and blue. Then, we get the\nbitplanes for each color, e.g., 8 bits-per-pixel, i.e., 8 bitplanes-per-color.\nFrom now on, we will work with the bitplane corresponding to the most\nsignificant bit (MSB) of each color, exclusive manner. After a\nclassical-to-quantum interface (which includes a classical inverter), we have a\nquantum Boolean version of the image within the quantum machine. This\nmethodology allows us to avoid the problem of quantum measurement, which alters\nthe results of the measured except in the case of CBS. Said so far is extended\nto quantum algorithms outside image processing too. After filtering of the\ninverted version of MSB (inside quantum machine) the result passes through a\nquantum-classical interface (which involves another classical inverter) and\nthen proceeds to reassemble each color component and finally the ending\nfiltered image. Finally, we discuss the more appropriate metrics for image\ndenoising in a set of experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 14:43:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-12"}

In this article we propose an efficient\nGaussian-process-based method for exploring the parameter space using estimates\nof the likelihood from a sequential Monte Carlo sampler. Our method accounts\nfor the inherent Monte Carlo variability of the estimated likelihood, and does\nnot require knowledge of gradients. The procedure adds potential parameter\nvalues by maximizing the so-called expected improvement, leveraging the fact\nthat the likelihood function is assumed to be smooth. Our simulations\ndemonstrate that our method has significant computational and efficiency gains\nover existing grid- and gradient-based techniques.

Here we introduce a new\nmethod for deducing the inclination of magnetic elements and use it to test\nmagnetic field inclinations from inversions. We determine accurate positions of\na set of small, bright magnetic elements in high spatial resolution images\nsampling different photospheric heights obtained by the Sunrise balloon-borne\nsolar observatory. Together with estimates of the formation heights of the\nemployed spectral bands, these provide us with the inclinations of the magnetic\nfeatures. We also compute the magnetic inclination angle of the same magnetic\nfeatures from the inversion of simultaneously recorded Stokes parameters. Our\nnew, geometric method returns nearly vertical fields (average inclination of\naround 14 deg with a relatively narrow distribution having a standard deviation\nof 6 deg). In strong contrast to this, the traditionally used inversions give\nalmost horizontal fields (average inclination of 75+-8 deg) for the same small\nmagnetic features, whose linearly polarised Stokes profiles are adversely\naffected by noise. The almost vertical field of bright magnetic features from\nour geometric method is clearly incompatible with the nearly horizontal\nmagnetic fields obtained from the inversions. This indicates that the amount of\nmagnetic flux in horizontal fields deduced from inversions is overestimated in\nthe presence of weak Stokes signals, in particular if Stokes Q and U are close\nto or under the noise level. By combining the proposed method with inversions\nwe are not just improving the inclination, but also the field strength. This\ntechnique allows us to analyse features that are not reliably treated by\ninversions, thus greatly extending our capability to study the complete\nmagnetic field of the quiet Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 15:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

We use our multi-wavelength data to simulate how merging LIRGs would\nappear from z~0.5-3 in deep optical and near-infrared images such as the HUDF,\nand use these simulations to measure the G-M20 at these redshifts.

The higher redshift values of M20 for the GOALS sources do not\nappear to change more than about 10% from the values at z~0. The change in\nG-M20 is caused by the surface brightness dimming of extended tidal features\nand asymmetries, and also the decreased spatial resolution which reduced the\nnumber of individual clumps identified.

The final saliency\nvalues are inferred optimally combining all the saliency cues in different\nscales using hierarchical inference. Through our inference model, single-scale\ninformation is selected to obtain a saliency map. Our method improves detection\nquality on many images that cannot be handled well traditionally. We also\nconstruct an extended Complex Scene Saliency Dataset (ECSSD) to include complex\nbut general natural images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 15:18:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 07:49:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

The model of\ncomputation takes into account symbol comparisons and not just comparisons\nbetween the strings. The analysis of upper and lower bounds for some classical\nalgorithms such as Quicksort and Mergesort in terms of such a model was shown.\nHere we extend the analysis to another classical algorithm - Heapsort. We also\ngive analysis for the version of the algorithm that uses Binomial heaps as a\nheap implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 11:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

Our aim is to construct computer\nmodels that exhibit creativity in an artistic context, that is, that are\ncapable of generating or evaluating an artwork (visual or linguistic), an\ninteresting new idea, a subjective opinion. The research was conducted in\n2008-2012 at the Computational Linguistics Research Group (CLiPS, University of\nAntwerp) under the supervision of Prof. Walter Daelemans. Prior research was\nalso conducted at the Experimental Media Research Group (EMRG, St. Lucas\nUniversity College of Art & Design Antwerp) under the supervision of Lucas\nNijs.\n  Modeling Creativity examines creativity in a number of different\nperspectives: from its origins in nature, which is essentially blind, to humans\nand machines, and from generating creative ideas to evaluating and learning\ntheir novelty and usefulness. We will use a hands-on approach with case studies\nand examples in the Python programming language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Aug 2014 20:54:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-02"}
