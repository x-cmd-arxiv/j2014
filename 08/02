Numerous models of eV-scale decaying dark matter have been\nproposed to explain this signal. Here we explore models of multicomponent\nnonabelian dark matter with typical mass ~ 1-10 GeV (higher values being\nallowed in some models) and eV-scale splittings that arise naturally from the\nbreaking of the nonabelian gauge symmetry. Kinetic mixing between the photon\nand the hidden sector gauge bosons can occur through a dimension-5 or 6\noperator. Radiative decays of the excited states proceed through transition\nmagnetic moments that appear at one loop. The decaying excited states can\neither be primordial or else produced by upscattering of the lighter dark\nmatter states. These models are significantly constrained by direct dark matter\nsearches or cosmic microwave background distortions, and are potentially\ntestable in fixed target experiments that search for hidden photons. We note\nthat the upscattering mechanism could be distinguished from decays in future\nobservations if sources with different dark matter velocity dispersions seem to\nrequire different values of the scattering cross section to match the observed\nline strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2014 16:52:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 20:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Typically one of these\noscillations is strongly non-sinusoidal. Two oscillations are sufficient for\nthe standard Blazhko effect; additional oscillations are needed to explain\nmulti-frequency modulation. Previous work on this hypothesis by Arthur N. Cox\nand others is extended in this paper by developing a simple (non-hydro) model\nthat can accurately reproduce several important features found in Kepler data\nfor RR Lyr, including the pulsation waveform, the upper and lower Blazhko\nenvelope functions and the motion, disappearance and reappearance of the bump\nfeature. The non-sinusoidal oscillation is probably generated by the\nfundamental mode and the other oscillations are probably generated by nonradial\nmodes. This model provides an explanation for the strong asymmetry observed in\nthe side peak spectra of most RR Lyrae stars. The motion and disappearance of\nthe bump feature are shown to be an illusion, just an artifact of combining the\noscillations. V445 Lyr is presented as an example with dual modulation. The\nmysterious double-maxima waveform observed for this star is explained,\nproviding additional strong evidence that this beating-modes hypothesis is\ncorrect.

While the solar and jovian\nnitrogen isotope ratio is believed to represent the composition of the\nprotosolar nebula, a still unidentified process has caused 15N-enrichment in\nthe solids. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the variations,\nincluding chemical fractionation. However, observational results that constrain\nthe fractionation models are scarce. While there is evidence of 15N-enrichment\nin prestellar cores, it is unclear how the signature evolves into the\nprotostellar phases. Our aim is to measure the 14N/15N ratio around three\nnearby, embedded low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. Isotopologues of HCN and\nHNC were used to probe the 14N/15N ratio. A selection of H13CN, HC15N, HN13C,\nand H15NC transitions was observed with the APEX telescope. The 14N/15N ratios\nwere derived from the integrated intensities assuming a standard 12C/13C ratio.\nThe assumption of optically thin emission was verified using radiative transfer\nmodeling and hyperfine structure fitting. Two sources, IRAS 16293A and R CrA\nIRS7B, show 15N-enrichment by a factor of around 1.5-2.5 in both HCN and HNC\nwith respect to the solar composition. Solar composition cannot be excluded for\nthe third source, OMC-3 MMS6. Furthermore, there are indications of a trend\ntoward increasing 14N/15N ratios with increasing outer envelope temperature.\nThe enhanced 15N abundances in HCN and HNC found in two Class~0 sources\n(14N/15N of 160-290) and the tentative trend toward a temperature-dependent\n14N/15N ratio are consistent with the chemical fractionation scenario, but\n14N/15N ratios from additional tracers are indispensable for testing the\nmodels. Spatially resolved observations are needed to distinguish between\nchemical fractionation and isotope-selective photochemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2014 20:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

While such models may be difficult to test in\ncolliders, we propose looking for signatures at much lower energies. We show\nthat a keV line in the X-ray spectrum of galaxy clusters (such as the recently\ndisputed 3.5 keV observation) can have its origin in a universal string axion\ncoupled to a hidden supersymmetry breaking sector. A linear combination of the\nstring axion and an additional axion in the hidden sector remains light,\nobtaining a mass of order 10 keV through supersymmetry breaking dynamics. In\norder to explain the X-ray line, the scale of supersymmetry breaking must be\nabout $10^{11-12}$ GeV. This motivates high scale supersymmetry as in pure\ngravity mediation or minimal split supersymmetry and is consistent with all\ncurrent limits. Since the axion mass is controlled by a dynamical mass scale,\nthis mass can be much higher during inflation, avoiding isocurvature (and\ndomain wall) problems associated with high scale inflation.

This is of\nparticular interest in finance, as the increasing complexity of financial\nsystems is coupled with information overload. Opinion formation, therefore, is\nnot always the result of optimal information processing. On the contrary,\nagents are boundedly rational and naturally tend to observe and imitate others\nin order to gain further insights. Hence, a certain degree of interaction,\nwhich can be envisioned as a network, occurs within the system. Opinions, the\ninteraction network and prices in financial markets are then heavily\nintertwined and influence one another. We build on previous contributions on\nadaptive systems, where agents have hetereogenous beliefs, and introduce a\ndynamic confidence network that captures the interaction and shapes the opinion\npatterns. The analytical framework we adopt for modeling the interaction is\nrooted in the opinion dynamics problem. This will allow us to introduce a\nnonlinear model where the confidence network, opinion dynamics and price\nformation coevolve in time. A key aspect of the model is the classification of\nagents according to their topological role in the network, therefore showing\nthat topology matters in determining how of opinions and prices will coevolve.\nWe illustrate the dynamics via simulations, discussing the stylized facts in\nfinance that the model is able to capture. Last, we propose an empirical\nvalidation and calibration scheme that makes use of social network data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2014 21:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-05"}

This paper examines\nthe use of two common truncated Lennard-Jones (WCA) potentials to describe a\npair of colloidal particles in a thermal bath of depletants. The shifted-WCA\nmodel is the steeper of the two repulsive potentials considered, while the\ncombinatorial-WCA model is the softer. It is found that the depletion-induced\nwell depth for the combinatorial-WCA model is significantly deeper than the\nshifted-WCA model because the resulting overlap of the colloids yields extra\naccessible volume for depletants. For both shifted- and combinatorial-WCA\nsimulations, the second virial coefficients and pair potentials between\ncolloids are demonstrated to be well approximated by the Morphometric\nThermodynamics (MT) model. This agreement suggests that the presence of\ndepletants can be accurately modelled in MD simulations by implicitly including\nthem through simple, analytical MT forms for depletion-induced interactions.\nAlthough both WCA potentials are found to be effective generic coarse-grained\nsimulation approaches for studying depletion effects in complicated soft matter\nsystems, combinatorial-WCA is the more efficient approach as depletion effects\nare enhanced at lower depletant densities. The findings indicate that for soft\nmatter systems that are better modelled by potentials with some\ncompressibility, predictions from hard-sphere systems could greatly\nunderestimate the magnitude of depletion effects at a given depletant density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2014 21:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

As predictor dimension\nincreases, variable selection becomes essential to avoid over-fitting, to\nprovide more accurate predictors and to yield more interpretable parameters. We\npropose a global variable selection approach that penalizes the total number of\nvariables across all PLS components. Put another way, the proposed global\npenalty encourages the selected variables to be shared among the PLS\ncomponents. We formulate PLS-R with joint sparsity as a variational\noptimization problem with objective function equal to a novel global SIMPLS\ncriterion plus a mixed norm sparsity penalty on the weight matrix.

We here present formulae for identifying under which circumstances\nbiases are inflated or reduced. In particular, we show that the magnitude of\nM-Bias in linear structural equation models tends to be relatively small\ncompared to confounding bias, suggesting that it is generally not a serious\nconcern in many applied settings. These theoretical results are consistent with\nrecent empirical findings from simulation studies. We also generalize the\nM-Bias setting (1) to allow for the correlation between the latent factors to\nbe nonzero, and (2) to allow for the collider to be a confounder between the\ntreatment and the outcome. These results demonstrate that mild deviations from\nthe M-Structure tend to increase confounding bias more rapidly than M-Bias,\nsuggesting that choosing to condition on any given covariate is generally the\nsuperior choice. As an application, we re-examine a controversial example\nbetween Professors Donald Rubin and Judea Pearl.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 2014 01:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-05"}

Despite their increasing popularity, in general recommender\nsystems suffer from the data sparsity and the cold-start problems. To alleviate\nthese issues, in recent years there has been an upsurge of interest in\nexploiting social information such as trust relations among users along with\nthe rating data to improve the performance of recommender systems. The main\nmotivation for exploiting trust information in recommendation process stems\nfrom the observation that the ideas we are exposed to and the choices we make\nare significantly influenced by our social context. However, in large user\ncommunities, in addition to trust relations, the distrust relations also exist\nbetween users. For instance, in Epinions the concepts of personal \"web of\ntrust\" and personal \"block list\" allow users to categorize their friends based\non the quality of reviews into trusted and distrusted friends, respectively. In\nthis paper, we propose a matrix factorization based model for recommendation in\nsocial rating networks that properly incorporates both trust and distrust\nrelationships aiming to improve the quality of recommendations and mitigate the\ndata sparsity and the cold-start users issues. Through experiments on the\nEpinions data set, we show that our new algorithm outperforms its standard\ntrust-enhanced or distrust-enhanced counterparts with respect to accuracy,\nthereby demonstrating the positive effect that incorporation of explicit\ndistrust information can have on recommender systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 2014 01:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-05"}

The sp3\ndistortion of carbon atoms at the GNR edges induces a large spin-orbit coupling\non the edges atoms, which enhances spin-flip scattering of edge states of the\nzigzag GNR. With sufficient spin-flip scattering, the wave-function of edge\nstates becomes a superposition of the spin-up and spin-down components. Then\nthe coupling of the two edges becomes important.

While the thermodynamic paradigm has\ndominated theoretical research for decades, the purely kinetic perspective of\nthe dynamical facilitation (DF) theory has attained prominence in recent times.\nIn particular, recent experiments and simulations have highlighted the\nimportance of facilitation using simple model systems composed of spherical\nparticles. However, an overwhelming majority of liquids possess anisotropy in\nparticle shape and interactions and it is therefore imperative to examine\nfacilitation in complex glass-formers. Here, we apply the DF theory to systems\nwith orientational degrees of freedom as well as anisotropic attractive\ninteractions. By analyzing data from experiments on colloidal ellipsoids, we\nshow that facilitation plays a pivotal role in translational as well as\norientational relaxation. Further, we demonstrate that the introduction of\nattractive interactions leads to spatial decoupling of translational and\nrotational facilitation, which subsequently results in the decoupling of\ndynamical heterogeneities. Most strikingly, the DF theory can predict the\nexistence of reentrant glass transitions based on the statistics of localized\ndynamical events, called excitations, whose duration is substantially smaller\nthan the structural relaxation time. Our findings pave the way for\nsystematically testing the DF approach in complex glass-formers and also\nestablish the significance of facilitation in governing structural relaxation\nin supercooled liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 2014 06:39:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

SHIRaC is a part of SPIRAL 2 facility at\nGANIL laboratory in France. Its purposes are to enhance as much as possible the\nbeam quality: transverse geometric emittance of less than 3 {\\pi}.mm.mrad and a\nlongitudinal energy spread close to 1 eV, and to transmit more than 60 % of\nions. Numerical simulations and experimental studies have shown that the\nrequired beam quality can be reached only in the term of the emittance. The\nenergy spread is very far from expected values. It is sensitive to the space\ncharge and buffer gas diffusion and more importantly to the RF field derivative\neffect. The latter arises at the RFQ exit and increases with the following RF\nparameters: the frequency and the amplitude of the RF voltage applied to the\nRFQ electrodes. Studies allowing to enhance the cooled beam quality, mainly the\nenergy spread reduction, are presented and discussed along this paper. They\nconsist in implementing a miniature RFQ at the RFQ exit.

[Oriols X 2007 Phys. Rev. Lett., 98 066803], an algorithm to\ndeal with the exchange interaction in non-separable quantum systems is\npresented. The algorithm can be applied to fermions or bosons and, by\nconstruction, it exactly ensures that any observable is totally independent\nfrom the interchange of particles. It is based on the use of conditional\nBohmian wave functions which are solutions of single-particle\npseudo-Schr\\\"odinger equations. The exchange symmetry is directly defined by\ndemanding symmetry properties of the quantum trajectories in the configuration\nspace with a universal algorithm, rather than through a particular\nexchange-correlation functional introduced into the single-particle\npseudo-Schr\\\"odinger equation. It requires the computation of N^2 conditional\nwave functions to deal with N identical particles. For separable Hamiltonians,\nthe algorithm reduces to the standard Slater determinant for fermions, or\npermanent for bosons. A numerical test for a two-particle system, where exact\nsolutions for non-separable Hamiltonians are computationally accessible, is\npresented. The numerical viability of the algorithm for quantum electron\ntransport (in a far-from equilibrium time-dependent open system) is\ndemonstrated by computing the current and fluctuations in a nano-resistor, with\nexchange and Coulomb interactions among electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 2014 15:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-05"}

This result has been often\ninterpreted as a signature of primordial gravitational waves from cosmic\ninflation, even if actually polarized dust emission may be at the origin of\nsuch a signal. Even assuming that part of this CMB B-mode polarization really\ncorresponds to the early Universe dynamics, its interpretation in terms of\ninflation and primordial gravitational waves is not the only possible one.\nAlternative cosmologies such as pre-Big Bang patterns and the spinorial\nspace-time (SST) we introduced in 1996-97 can naturally account for such CMB\nB-modes. In particular, the SST automatically generates a privileged space\ndirection (PSD) whose existence may have been confirmed by Planck data. If such\na PSD exists, it seems normal to infer that vector perturbations have been\npresent in the early Universe leading to CMB B-modes in suitable cosmological\npatterns. Inflation would not be required to explain the BICEP2 result assuming\nit really contains a primordial signal. More generally, pre-Big Bang\ncosmologies can also generate gravitational waves in the early Universe without\nany need for cosmic inflation. We further discuss here possible alternatives to\nthe inflationary interpretation of a primordial B-mode polarization of cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 2014 13:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-28"}
