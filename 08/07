By\npartially removing non-linear damping caused by bulk motions, the real-space\nBAO peak in the correlation function is sharpened, and oscillations in the\npower spectrum are visible to smaller scales. In turn these lead to stronger\nmeasurements of the BAO scale. Future surveys are being designed assuming that\nthis improvement has been applied, and this technique is therefore of critical\nimportance for future BAO measurements. A number of reconstruction techniques\nare available, but the most widely used is a simple algorithm that decorrelates\nlarge-scale and small-scale modes approximately removing the bulk-flow\ndisplacements by moving the overdensity field (Eisenstein et al. 2007;\nPadmanabhan, White & Cohn 2009).

To date, a number of authors have considered the influence of a spin-pole\naligned dipole magnetic field on the dynamical state of a weakly-ionized\natmosphere and found that magnetic breaking may lead to significantly slower\nwinds than predicted within a purely hydrodynamical framework. Here, we\nconsider the effect of a tilted dipole magnetic field on the circulation and\ndemonstrate that in addition to regulating wind velocities, an oblique field\ngenerates stationary non-axisymmetric structures that adhere to the geometry of\nthe magnetic pole.

The detection and study of such\naccreting systems is crucial to understand the build-up of the most massive\nvirialized structures we see today. We report the discovery with XMM-Newton of\nan irregular X-ray substructure in the outskirts of the massive galaxy cluster\nAbell 2142. The tip of the X-ray emission coincides with a concentration of\ngalaxies. The bulk of the X-ray emission of this substructure appears to be\nlagging behind the galaxies and extends over a projected scale of at least 800\nkpc. The temperature of the gas in this region is 1.4 keV, which is a factor of\n~4 lower than the surrounding medium and is typical of the virialized plasma of\na galaxy group with a mass of a few 10^13M_sun. For this reason, we interpret\nthis structure as a galaxy group in the process of being accreted onto the main\ndark-matter halo. The X-ray structure trailing behind the group is due to gas\nstripped from its original dark-matter halo as it moves through the\nintracluster medium (ICM). This is the longest X-ray trail reported to date.\nFor an infall velocity of ~1,200 km s-1 we estimate that the stripped gas has\nbeen surviving in the presence of the hot ICM for at least 600 Myr, which\nexceeds the Spitzer conduction timescale in the medium by a factor of >~400.\nSuch a strong suppression of conductivity is likely related to a tangled\nmagnetic field with small coherence length and to plasma microinstabilities.\nThe long survival time of the low-entropy intragroup medium suggests that the\ninfalling material can eventually settle within the core of the main cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}

If\ndark matter populates the interior of stars, and this matter is supersymmetric\nor of some other type, some of it possessing a tiny electric charge, there is\nthe possibility that highly compact stars can trap a small but non-negligible\nelectric charge. In this case the radius to mass relation for such compact\nstars should get modifications. We use an analytical scheme to investigate the\nlimiting radius to mass relation and the maximum mass of relativistic stars\nmade of an incompressible fluid with a small electric charge. The investigation\nis carried out by using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation, i.e., the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, together with the other equations of\nstructure, with the further hypothesis that the charge distribution is\nproportional to the energy density. The approach relies on Volkoff and Misner's\nmethod to solve the TOV equation. For zero charge one gets the interior\nSchwarzschild limit, and supposing incompressible boson or fermion matter with\nconstituents with masses of the order of the neutron mass one gets that the\nmaximum mass is the Misner mass. For a small electric charge, our analytical\napproximating scheme valid in first order in the star's electric charge, shows\nthat the maximum mass increases relatively to the uncharged case, whereas the\nminimum possible radius decreases, an expected effect since the new field is\nrepulsive aiding the pressure to sustain the star against gravitational\ncollapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 20:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 19:25:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-25"}

In this\ncontext, it is interesting to note a recent proposal that such a spin-triplet\npairing instability occurs when the band filling is near van Hove singularities\n(vHS) associated with momenta away from time-reversal invariant momenta named\ntype-II vHS. However, this result was obtained within a weak coupling\nrenormalization group with Fermi surface patch approximation. To explore\nsuperconducting instabilities beyond this weak coupling Fermi surface patch\napproximation, we perform systematic study on Hubbard model in a\ntwo-dimensional square lattice using three different methods: random phase\napproximation, large-scale dynamical mean field theory simulations with\ncontinuous time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) impurity solver, and large-scale\ndynamical cluster simulations with CTQMC cluster solver. We find, in a wide\ndoping range centered around the type-II van Hove filling, a two-fold\ndegenerate, spin-triplet, odd-parity $p$-wave pairing state emerges due to\nrepulsive interaction, when the Fermi surface is not sufficiently nested.\nPossible relevance of our findings to the recently discovered superconductors\nLaO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$BiS$_{2}$, Ir$_{1-x}$Pt$_{x}$Te$_{2}$ and proposed doped\nBC$_{3}$ are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 20:03:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 15:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Because in iron chalcogenides the\ncorrelations are stronger than in the iron arsenides, we assume in our model\nthat some of the Fe orbitals give rise to localized magnetic moments. These\nmoments interact with each other via exchange interactions as well as\nphonon-mediated biquadratic interactions that favor a collinear double-stripe\nstate, corresponding to the ordering vectors $\\left(\\pm\\pi/2,\\pm\\pi/2\\right)$.\nThe remaining Fe orbitals are assumed to be itinerant, giving rise to the\nfirst-principle derived Fermi surface displaying nesting features at momenta\n$\\left(\\pi,0\\right)/\\left(0,\\pi\\right)$. Increasing the amount of itinerant\nelectrons due to excess Fe, $y$, leads to changes in the Fermi surface and to\nthe suppression of its nesting properties. As a result, due to the Hund's\ncoupling between the itinerant and localized moments, increasing $y$ leads to\nmodifications in the local moments' exchange interactions via the multi-orbital\ngeneralization of the long-range Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\ninteraction. By numerically computing the RKKY corrections and minimizing the\nresulting effective exchange Hamiltonian, we find, in general, that the excess\nelectrons introduced in the system change the classical magnetic ground state\nfrom a double-stripe state to an incommensurate spiral, consistent with the\nexperimental observations.

Our observations find no convincing underlying quiescent sources\ncoincident with the locations of these transients, allowing us to rule out a\nnumber of potential progenitor systems. The presence of surviving massive-star\nbinary companions (or other cluster members) are ruled out, providing an\nindependent rejection of a massive star origin for these events. Dwarf\nsatellite galaxies are disfavoured unless one invokes as yet unknown conditions\nthat would be extremely favourable for their production in the lowest mass\nsystems. Our limits also probe the majority of the globular cluster luminosity\nfunction, ruling out the presence of an underlying globular cluster population\nat high significance, and thus the possibility that they are created via\ndynamical interactions in dense globular cluster cores. Given the lack of\nunderlying systems, previous progenitor suggestions have difficulty reproducing\nthe remote locations of these transients, even when considering solely\nhalo-borne progenitors. Our preferred scenario is that calcium-rich transients\nare high velocity, kicked systems, exploding at large distances from their\nnatal site. Coupled with a long-lived progenitor system post-kick, this\nnaturally explains the lack of association these transients have with their\nhost stellar light, and the extreme host-offsets exhibited. Neutron star --\nwhite dwarf mergers may be a promising progenitor system in this scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 21:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Such information\nmay, however, be unavailable or difficult to obtain. Moreover, one is often\nprimarily interested in enforcing a desired target flow as the equilibrium by\nsuitably influencing player behavior in the routing game. We ask whether one\ncan achieve target flows as equilibria without knowing the underlying latency\nfunctions.\n  Our main result gives a crisp positive answer to this question. We show that,\nunder fairly general settings, one can efficiently compute edge tolls that\ninduce a given target multicommodity flow in a nonatomic routing game using a\npolynomial number of queries to an oracle that takes candidate tolls as input\nand returns the resulting equilibrium flow. This result is obtained via a novel\napplication of the ellipsoid method. Our algorithm extends easily to many other\nsettings, such as (i) when certain edges cannot be tolled or there is an upper\nbound on the total toll paid by a user, and (ii) general nonatomic congestion\ngames. We obtain tighter bounds on the query complexity for series-parallel\nnetworks, and single-commodity routing games with linear latency functions, and\ncomplement these with a query-complexity lower bound. We also obtain strong\npositive results for Stackelberg routing to achieve target equilibria in\nseries-parallel graphs.\n  Our results build upon various new techniques that we develop pertaining to\nthe computation of, and connections between, different notions of approximate\nequilibrium; properties of multicommodity flows and tolls in series-parallel\ngraphs; and sensitivity of equilibrium flow with respect to tolls. Our results\ndemonstrate that one can indeed circumvent the potentially-onerous task of\nmodeling latency functions, and yet obtain meaningful results for the\nunderlying routing game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 21:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-08"}

A criterion of reversibility is proven.\nThe problem is completely solved for infinite class of \"block collections\",\ni.e. $\\{(0,1,\\dots,h)|h\\in\\mathbb Z^+\\}$. Results obtained for \"exponential\ncollections\" $\\{(1,2,4,\\dots,2^h)|h\\in\\mathbb Z^+\\}$ essentially reduce the\ncomplexity of the problem for this class. Ways to transfer the results on other\nclasses of rules/collections are described. A conjecture is formulated for\nclass $\\{(0,1,2^m)|m\\in\\mathbb Z^+\\}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2014 02:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-08"}

Recently, a number of problems in different application areas\nhave emerged that involve a significantly larger number of subspaces relative\nto the ambient dimension. It becomes imperative in such settings to first\nidentify a smaller set of active subspaces that contribute to the observation\nbefore further processing can be carried out. This problem of identification of\na small set of active subspaces among a huge collection of subspaces from a\nsingle (noisy) observation in the ambient space is termed subspace unmixing.\nThis paper formally poses the subspace unmixing problem under the parsimonious\nsubspace-sum (PS3) model, discusses connections of the PS3 model to problems in\nwireless communications, hyperspectral imaging, high-dimensional statistics and\ncompressed sensing, and proposes a low-complexity algorithm, termed marginal\nsubspace detection (MSD), for subspace unmixing. The MSD algorithm turns the\nsubspace unmixing problem for the PS3 model into a multiple hypothesis testing\n(MHT) problem and its analysis in the paper helps control the family-wise error\nrate of this MHT problem at any level $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ under two random\nsignal generation models. Some other highlights of the analysis of the MSD\nalgorithm include: (i) it is applicable to an arbitrary collection of subspaces\non the Grassmann manifold; (ii) it relies on properties of the collection of\nsubspaces that are computable in polynomial time; and ($iii$) it allows for\nlinear scaling of the number of active subspaces as a function of the ambient\ndimension. Finally, numerical results are presented in the paper to better\nunderstand the performance of the MSD algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2014 02:44:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2016 01:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

The question remains: how does the magnetic reconnection change the\nflux rope structure? Following the original study of \\citet{Qiu2007}, we\ncompare properties of ICME/MC flux ropes measured at 1 AU and properties of\nassociated solar progenitors including flares, filaments, and CMEs. In\nparticular, the magnetic field-line twist distribution within interplanetary\nmagnetic flux ropes is systematically derived and examined. Our analysis shows\nthat for most of these events, the amount of twisted flux per AU in MCs is\ncomparable with the total reconnection flux on the Sun, and the sign of the MC\nhelicity is consistent with the sign of helicity of the solar source region\njudged from the geometry of post-flare loops. Remarkably, we find that about\none half of the 18 magnetic flux ropes, most of them being associated with\nerupting filaments, have a nearly uniform and relatively low twist distribution\nfrom the axis to the edge, and the majority of the other flux ropes exhibit\nvery high twist near the axis, of up to $\\gtrsim 5$ turns per AU, which\ndecreases toward the edge. The flux ropes are therefore not linear force free.\nWe also conduct detailed case studies showing the contrast of two events with\ndistinct twist distribution in MCs as well as different flare and dimming\ncharacteristics in solar source regions, and discuss how reconnection geometry\nreflected in flare morphology may be related to the structure of the flux rope\nformed on the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2014 02:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-30"}

A mathematical formulation is suggested based on the definition of\nprobabilities of system states, whose particular cases characterize the\nprobabilities of structures, patterns, scenarios, or prospects. In this general\nframework, it is shown that the mathematical structures of self-organization\nand of decision making are identical. This makes it clear how self-organization\ncan be seen as an endogenous decision making process and, reciprocally,\ndecision making occurs via an endogenous self-organization. The approach is\nillustrated by phase transitions in large statistical systems, crossovers in\nsmall statistical systems, evolutions and revolutions in social and biological\nsystems, structural self-organization in dynamical systems, and by the\nprobabilistic formulation of classical and behavioral decision theories. In all\nthese cases, self-organization is described as the process of evaluating the\nprobabilities of macroscopic states or prospects in the search for a state with\nthe largest probability. The general way of deriving the probability measure\nfor classical systems is the principle of minimal information, that is, the\nconditional entropy maximization under given constraints. Behavioral biases of\ndecision makers can be characterized in the same way as analogous to quantum\nfluctuations in natural systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2014 10:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-08"}

This has led to the\ncreation of a distinct online social identity which in turn has created the\nneed of online social reputation management techniques.

This has given rise to underground markets which buy/sell\nfraudulent accounts, `likes', `comments' (Facebook, Instagram) and `followers'\n(Twitter) to artificially boost their social reputation. In this study, we\npresent an anatomy of purchased followers on Twitter and their behaviour.

A modification of the model accounting for the\neffects of adhesion hysteresis improves the agreement between theoretical and\nexperimental results. The contribution of the adhesion hysteresis can be\nreduced considerably by introducing a thin hydrogel layer atop the elastic film\nthat enhances the range of attraction of the cylinders (as well as rigid\nspheres) in a dramatic way. Morphological instabilities in the gel project\ncorrugated paths to the motion of small spheres, thus leading to a large\nnumbers of particles to aggregate along their defects. These observations\nsuggest that a thin hydrogel layer supported on a deformable elastic film\naffords an effective model system to study elasticity and defects mediated\ninteraction of particles on its surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Aug 2014 13:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-08"}

Photometry and spectroscopy follow the flux evolution from -13 to\n+272 days past the B-band maximum of -17.4 +/- 0.5 mag. The spectra are\ndominated by Fe II, O I, and Ca II absorption lines at ejecta velocities of\n20,000 km/s that change slowly over time. Other spectral absorption lines are\nconsistent with contributions from photospheric He I, and hydrogen may also be\npresent at higher velocities (> 27,000 km/s). We use these observations to\nestimate explosion properties and derive a total ejecta mass of 2.7 Msolar, a\nkinetic energy of 1.0x10^{52} erg, and a 56Ni mass of 0.1-0.2 Msolar.

Hence, LAMOST WDMS binaries may be drawn\nfrom a different parent population and thus help in overcoming the selection\neffects incorporated by SDSS on the current observed population.\n  Methods. We develop a fast and efficient routine based on the wavelet\ntransform to identify LAMOST WDMS binaries containing a DA white dwarf and a M\ndwarf companion, and apply a decomposition/fitting routine to their LAMOST\nspectra to estimate their distances and measure their stellar parameters,\nnamely the white dwarf effective temperatures, surface gravities and masses,\nand the secondary star spectral types.\n  Results.

Next he claims that the definition used in Ref. 2 for the Stokes\nmultiplier in the subdominant part of a complete expansion, which is\nresponsible for demonstrating that the Stokes phenomenon is discontinuous\nrather than a smooth transition, is not correct. It is shown that the Stokes\nmultiplier used in Ref. 2 is entirely consistent with Berry's description of\nthe conventional view of the Stokes phenomenon in his famous work where he\ndeveloped the smoothing view [15]. Furthermore, it is pointed out that Paris\nhas not substantiated the smoothing view by at least reproducing or improving\nthe results in Table 7 of Ref. 2, which not only confirm the jump discontinuous\nnature of the Stokes phenomenon, but also provide accurate values of $\\ln\n\\Gamma(z)$ to 30 figures, regardless of the size of the variable or whether the\ntruncation is optimal or not.
