The eruptions involve major flares with soft X-ray peak flux >/=\n5.0 x10-5 Wm-2 (i.e., flare size >/= M5.0) and accompanying coronal mass\nejections (CMEs). The selection criterion was based on the fact that the only\nfront-side GLE in cycle 24 (GLE 71) had a flare size of M5.1. Only ~37% of the\nmajor eruptions from the western hemisphere resulted in large SEP events.\nAlmost the same number of large SEP events was produced in weaker eruptions\n(flare size <M5.0), suggesting that the soft X-ray flare is not a good\nindicator of SEP or GLE events. On the other hand, the CME speed is a better\nindicator of SEP and GLE events because it is consistently high supporting the\nshock acceleration mechanism for SEPs and GLEs.

The\nstringent latitudinal requirement suggests that the highest energy particles\nare likely accelerated in the nose part of shocks.

Numerical support\nfor these results is presented using generalized non-linear Schroedinger\nequation, relevant for the implementation of the proposed protocol with\nultracold bosons, as well as for the integrable Calogero model in harmonic\npotential. Finally, it is shown that the effects of integrability breaking by a\nparabolic potential and by a power-law non-linearity do not change the\nuniversality of the short-time dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 19:45:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 20:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-10"}

The sample has a\nmedian optical magnitude R=26.0, and ranges from R23 to R>27, corresponding to\nrest-frame UV absolute magnitudes M_UV-22 to M_UV>-18.2. Dynamical masses range\nfrom M_dyn<1.3e8 Msun to M_dyn=6.8e9 Msun, with a median value of M_dyn=6.3e8\nMsun. Thirty of the 36 Lya emission lines are redshifted with respect to the\nsystemic velocity with at least 1 sigma significance, and the velocity offset\nwith respect to systemic dv_Lya is correlated with R-band magnitude, M_UV, and\nthe velocity dispersion measured from nebular emission lines with >3 sigma\nsignificance: brighter galaxies with larger velocity dispersions tend to have\nlarger values of dv_Lya. We also make use of a comparison sample of 122\nUV-color-selected R<25.5 galaxies at z2, all with Lya emission and systemic\nredshifts measured from nebular emission lines. Using the combined LAE and\ncomparison samples for a total of 158 individual galaxies, we find that dv_Lya\nis anti-correlated with the Lya equivalent width with 7 sigma significance. Our\nresults are consistent with a scenario in which the Lya profile is determined\nprimarily by the properties of the gas near the systemic redshift; in such a\nscenario, the opacity to Lya photons in lower mass galaxies may be reduced if\nlarge gaseous disks have not yet developed and if the gas is ionized by the\nharder spectrum of young, low metallicity stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 20:01:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 14:55:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 19:43:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The most common such models are continuous\ntime Markov chains (CTMCs). Parametric sensitivities, which are derivatives of\nexpectations of model output quantities with respect to model parameters, are\nuseful in this setting for a variety of applications. In this paper, we\nintroduce a class of hybrid pathwise differentiation methods for the numerical\nestimation of parametric sensitivities. The new hybrid methods combine elements\nfrom the three main classes of procedures for sensitivity estimation, and have\na number of desirable qualities.

The introduction of general order\nparameters leads to a more strongly coupled system of phase field equations, in\ncontrast to that with certain special choice of the order parameters. However,\nthe general form enables one to compute the N-phase mixing energy density\ncoefficients in an explicit fashion in terms of the pairwise surface tensions.\nFrom the simulation perspective, the increased complexity in the form of the\nphase field equations with general order parameters in actuality does not cause\nessential computational difficulties.

In\nmany practical resource controllers the competing users' metrics are\ncommunicated to the resource controller, which then computes the desired\nextremization function.

If the extremization\nfunction is to be computed losslessly, the rate savings are shown in most cases\nto be at most 2 bits independent of the number of competing users. Motivated by\nthe small savings in the lossless case, simple achievable schemes for both the\nlossy and interactive variants of this problem are considered.

Planet formation theories\nsuggest that such planets are unlikely to have formed in-situ but instead may\nhave formed at large orbital separations beyond the snow line and migrated\ninward to their present orbits. Two competing hypotheses suggest that the\nplanets migrated either through interaction with the protoplanetary disk during\ntheir formation, or by disk-free mechanisms such as gravitational interactions\nwith a third body. Observations of eccentricities and spin-orbit misalignments\nof hot Jupiter systems have been unable to differentiate between the two\nhypotheses. In the present work, we suggest that chemical depletions in hot\nJupiter atmospheres might be able to constrain their migration mechanisms. We\nfind that sub-solar carbon and oxygen abundances in Jovian-mass hot Jupiters\naround Sun-like stars are hard to explain by disk migration. Instead, such\nabundances are more readily explained by giant planets forming at large orbital\nseparations, either by core accretion or gravitational instability, and\nmigrating to close-in orbits via disk-free mechanisms involving dynamical\nencounters. Such planets also contain solar or super-solar C/O ratios. On the\ncontrary, hot Jupiters with super-solar O and C abundances can be explained by\na variety of formation-migration pathways which, however, lead to solar or\nsub-solar C/O ratios. Current estimates of low oxygen abundances in hot Jupiter\natmospheres may be indicative of disk-free migration mechanisms.

The\nwell-known sunflower lemma states that a given family ${\\cal F}$ of sets, each\nof cardinality at most $s$, includes a sunflower of cardinality $k$ if $|{\\cal\nF}|> (k-1)^s s!$. Since Erd\\\"os and Rado proved it in 1960, it has not been\nknown for more than half a century whether the sunflower bound $(k-1)^s s!$ can\nbe improved asymptotically for any $k$ and $s$. It is conjectured that it can\nbe reduced to $c_k^s$ for some real number $c_k>0$ depending only on $k$, which\nis called the sunflower conjecture.

A new sparse Bayesian probabilistic framework\nfor computing the probability of localized stiffness reductions induced by\ndamage is presented that uses noisy incomplete modal data from before and after\npossible damage. This new approach employs system modal parameters of the\nstructure as extra variables for Bayesian model updating with incomplete modal\ndata. A specific hierarchical Bayesian model is constructed that promotes\nspatial sparseness in the inferred stiffness reductions in a way that is\nconsistent with the Bayesian Ockham razor. To obtain the most plausible model\nof sparse stiffness reductions together with its uncertainty within a specified\nclass of models, the method employs an optimization scheme that iterates among\nall uncertain parameters, including the hierarchical hyper-parameters. The\napproach has four important benefits: (1) it infers spatially-sparse stiffness\nchanges based on the identified modal parameters; (2) the uncertainty in the\ninferred stiffness reductions is quantified; (3) no matching of model and\nexperimental modes is needed, and (4) solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem\nof a structural model is not required. The proposed method is applied to two\npreviously-studied examples using simulated data: a ten-story shear-building\nand the three-dimensional braced-frame model from the Phase II Simulated\nBenchmark problem sponsored by the IASC-ASCE Task Group on Structural Health\nMonitoring.

It is still\ncommonly held that the surface gravity of a stationary black hole can be\nconstrued as a true physical temperature and its area as a true entropy only\nwhen quantum effects are taken into account; in the context of classical\ngeneral relativity alone, one cannot cogently construe them so. Does the use of\nquantum field theory in curved spacetime offer the only hope for taking the\nanalogy seriously? I think the answer is `no'. To attempt to justify that\nanswer, I shall begin by arguing that the standard argument to the contrary is\nnot physically well founded, and in any event begs the question. Looking at the\nvarious ways that the ideas of \"temperature\" and \"entropy\" enter classical\nthermodynamics then will suggest arguments that, I claim, show the analogy\nbetween classical black-hole mechanics and classical thermodynamics should be\ntaken more seriously, without the need to rely on or invoke quantum mechanics.\nIn particular, I construct an analogue of a Carnot cycle in which a black hole\n\"couples\" with an ordinary thermodynamical system in such a way that its\nsurface gravity plays the role of temperature and its area that of entropy.\nThus, the connection between classical general relativity and classical\nthermodynamics on their own is already deep and physically significant,\nindependent of quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Aug 2014 01:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 2014 20:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

Our approach relies on a general statistical\ninference framework that captures the privacy threat under inference attacks,\ngiven utility constraints. Under this framework, data is distorted before it is\nreleased, according to a privacy-preserving probabilistic mapping. This mapping\nis obtained by solving a convex optimization problem, which minimizes\ninformation leakage under a distortion constraint. We address practical\nchallenges encountered when applying this theoretical framework to real world\ndata. On one hand, the design of optimal privacy-preserving mechanisms requires\nknowledge of the prior distribution linking private data and data to be\nreleased, which is often unavailable in practice. On the other hand, the\noptimization may become untractable and face scalability issues when data\nassumes values in large size alphabets, or is high dimensional. Our work makes\nthree major contributions. First, we provide bounds on the impact on the\nprivacy-utility tradeoff of a mismatched prior. Second, we show how to reduce\nthe optimization size by introducing a quantization step, and how to generate\nprivacy mappings under quantization. Third, we evaluate our method on three\ndatasets, including a new dataset that we collected, showing correlations\nbetween political convictions and TV viewing habits. We demonstrate that good\nprivacy properties can be achieved with limited distortion so as not to\nundermine the original purpose of the publicly released data, e.g.\nrecommendations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Aug 2014 03:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

The system at first takes as\ninput, a 3D range image, simultaneously registers it using ICP(Iterative\nClosest Point) algorithm. ICP used in this work, registers facial surfaces to a\ncommon model by minimizing distances between a probe model and a gallery model.\nHowever the performance of ICP relies heavily on the initial conditions. Hence,\nit is necessary to provide an initial registration, which will be improved\niteratively and finally converge to the best alignment possible. Once the faces\nare registered, the occlusions are automatically extracted by thresholding the\ndepth map values of the 3D image. After the occluded regions are detected,\nrestoration is done by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The restored images,\nafter the removal of occlusions, are then fed to the recognition system for\nclassification purpose. Features are extracted from the reconstructed\nnon-occluded face images in the form of face normals. The experimental results\nwhich were obtained on the occluded facial images from the Bosphorus 3D face\ndatabase, illustrate that our occlusion compensation scheme has attained a\nrecognition accuracy of 91.30%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Aug 2014 06:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-19"}

We present an absorber based sensing scheme at\nthe terahertz frequencies and discuss optimized designs to achieve high\nfrequency and amplitude sensitivities. The major advantage of a perfect\nmetamaterial absorber as a sensor is the sensitive shift in the absorber\nresonance frequency along with the sharp change in the amplitude of the\nresonance due to strong interaction of the analyte with the electric and the\nmagnetic fields at resonant perfect absorption frequency. We compare the\nsensing performance of the perfect metamaterial absorber with its complementary\nstructural design and planar metasurface with identical structure.

Tens of light hydrides and small molecules have now been detected\nover several hundreds sight lines sampling the diffuse interstellar medium\n(ISM) in both the Solar neighbourhood and the inner Galactic disk. They provide\nunprecedented statistics on the first steps of chemistry in the diffuse gas.\nAims. These new data confirm the limitations of the traditional chemical\npathways driven by the UV photons and the cosmic rays (CR) and the need for\nadditional energy sources, such as turbulent dissipation, to open highly\nendoenergetic formation routes. The goal of the present paper is to further\ninvestigate the link between specific species and the properties of the\nturbulent cascade in particular its space-time intermittency. Methods. We have\nanalysed ten different atomic and molecular species in the framework of the\nupdated model of turbulent dissipation regions (TDR). We study the influence on\nthe abundances of these species of parameters specific to chemistry (density,\nUV field, and CR ionisation rate) and those linked to turbulence (the average\nturbulent dissipation rate, the dissipation timescale, and the ion neutral\nvelocity drift in the regions of dissipation). Results. The most sensitive\ntracers of turbulent dissipation are the abundances of CH+ and SH+, and the\ncolumn densities of the J = 3, 4, 5 rotational levels of H2 . The abundances of\nCO, HCO+, and the intensity of the 158 $\\mu$m [CII] emission line are\nsignificantly enhanced by turbulent dissipation. The vast diversity of chemical\npathways allows the independent determinations of free parameters never\nestimated before: an upper limit to the average turbulent dissipation rate,\n$\\overline{\\varepsilon}$ < 10$^{-23}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ for $n_H$=20\ncm$^{-3}$, from the CH+ abundance; an upper limit to the ion-neutral velocity\ndrift, $u_{in}$ < 3.5 km s$^{-1}$, from the SH+ to CH+ abundance ratio; and a\nrange of dissipation timescales, 100 < $\\tau_V$ < 1000 yr, from the CO to HCO+\nabundance ratio. For the first time, we reproduce the large abundances of CO\nobserved on diffuse lines of sight, and we show that CO may be abundant even in\nregions with UV-shieldings as low as $5 \\times 10^{-3}$ mag. The best range of\nparameters also reproduces the abundance ratios of OH, C2H, and H2O to HCO+ and\nare consistent with the known properties of the turbulent cascade in the\nGalactic diffuse ISM. Conclusions. Our results disclose an unexpected link\nbetween the dissipation of turbulence and the emergence of molecular richness\nin the diffuse ISM. Some species, such as CH+ or SH+, turn out to be unique\ntracers of the energy trail in the ISM. In spite of some degeneracy, the\nproperties of the turbulent cascade, down to dissipation, can be captured\nthrough specific molecular abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Aug 2014 07:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This\ndownsizing trend in the AGN evolution seems to be contradictory to the\nhierarchical structure formation scenario. In this study, we present the AGN\nspace density evolution predicted by a semi-analytic model of galaxy and AGN\nformation based on the hierarchical structure formation scenario. We\ndemonstrate that our model can reproduce the downsizing trend of the AGN space\ndensity evolution. The reason for the downsizing trend in our model is a\ncombination of the cold gas depletion as a consequence of star formation, the\ngas cooling suppression in massive halos and the AGN lifetime scaling with the\ndynamical timescale. We assume that a major merger of galaxies causes a\nstarburst, spheroid formation, and cold gas accretion onto a supermassive black\nhole (SMBH). We also assume that this cold gas accretion triggers AGN activity.\nSince the cold gas is mainly depleted by star formation and gas cooling is\nsuppressed in massive dark halos, the amount of cold gas accreted onto SMBHs\ndecreases with cosmic time. Moreover, AGN lifetime increases with cosmic time.\nThus, at low redshifts, major mergers do not always lead to luminous AGNs.\nBecause the luminosity of AGNs is correlated with the mass of accreted gas onto\nSMBHs, the space density of luminous AGNs decreases more quickly than that of\nfaint AGNs. We conclude that the anti-hierarchical evolution of the AGN space\ndensity is not contradictory to the hierarchical structure formation scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Aug 2014 09:15:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 04:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-02"}
