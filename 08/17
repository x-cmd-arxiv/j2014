The analysis makes use\nof several aspects of classical electromagnetic theory which are unfamiliar to\nmost physicists, including the Darwin Lagrangian, acceleration-based electric\nfields, internal electromagnetic momentum in a magnet, and a magnet model\ninvolving at least three mutually-interacting particles. Only when the\nacceleration-based electric forces acting on the passing charge are included do\nwe find consistency with all the relativistic conservation laws: energy, linear\nmomentum, angular momentum, and constant center-of-mass velocity. The electric\nforces on the passing charge lead to a lag effect which accounts quantitatively\nfor the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift. Thus the classical analysis strongly\nsuggests that the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift (observed when electrons pass a\nlong solenoid which corresponds to a line of magnetic dipoles) is the analogue\nof the Matteucci-Pozzi phase shift (observed when electrons pass a line of\nelectric dipoles).

Such generalized uncertainty principle [GUP] has been motivated from\nnot only quite general considerations of quantum mechanics and gravity, but\nalso string theoretic arguments. We examine the role of GUP in the context of\nblack hole complementarity. We find that while complementarity can be violated\nby large N rescaling if one assumes only the Heisenberg's Uncertainty\nPrinciple, the application of GUP may save complementarity, but only if certain\nN-dependence is also assumed. This raises two important questions beyond the\nscope of this work, i.e., whether GUP really has the proposed form of\nN-dependence, and whether black hole complementarity is indeed correct.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Aug 2014 19:24:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 22:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-12"}

One objective in mechanism design is\nto design a strategyproof process so that no agent will have an incentive to\nmisreport its type. However, typical analyses of the incentives properties of\nmechanisms operate under strong, usually untestable assumptions. Empirical,\ndata-oriented approaches are, at best, under-developed. Furthermore,\nmechanism/policy evaluation methods usually ignore the dynamic nature of a\nmulti-agent system and are thus inappropriate for estimating long-term effects.\nWe introduce the problem of estimating the causal effects of mechanisms on\nincentives and frame it under the Rubin causal framework \\citep{rubin74,\nrubin78}. This raises unique technical challenges since the outcome of interest\n(agent truthfulness) is confounded with strategic interactions and,\ninterestingly, is typically never observed under any mechanism. We develop a\nmethodology to estimate such causal effects that using a prior that is based on\na strategic equilibrium model. Working on the domain of kidney exchanges, we\nshow how to apply our methodology to estimate causal effects of kidney\nallocation mechanisms on hospitals' incentives. Our results demonstrate that\nthe use of game-theoretic prior captures the dynamic nature of the kidney\nexchange multiagent system and shrinks the estimates towards long-term effects,\nthus improving upon typical methods that completely ignore agents' strategic\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Aug 2014 01:49:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 15:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-19"}

These interactions evolve in response to changes in the protein's\nchemical or physical environment (such as the addition of an antibiotic), or\nwhen genes duplicate and diverge. Several recent studies have shown the\nimportance of folding stability in constraining protein evolution. Here we\ninvestigate how structural coupling between protein folding and binding -- the\nfact that most proteins can only bind their targets when folded -- gives rise\nto evolutionary coupling between the traits of folding stability and binding\nstrength. Using biophysical and evolutionary modeling, we show how these\nprotein traits can emerge as evolutionary \"spandrels\" even if they do not\nconfer an intrinsic fitness advantage. In particular, proteins can evolve\nstrong binding interactions that have no functional role but merely serve to\nstabilize the protein if misfolding is deleterious. Furthermore, such proteins\nmay have divergent fates, evolving to bind or not bind their targets depending\non random mutation events. These observations may explain the abundance of\napparently nonfunctional interactions among proteins observed in\nhigh-throughput assays. In contrast, for proteins with both functional binding\nand deleterious misfolding, evolution may be highly predictable at the level of\nbiophysical traits: adaptive paths are tightly constrained to first gain extra\nfolding stability and then partially lose it as the new binding function is\ndeveloped. These findings have important consequences for our understanding of\nfundamental evolutionary principles of both natural and engineered proteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Aug 2014 03:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-19"}

This is achieved essentially by\nrestricting the mentioned data of the Poincar\\'e bundle along the infinitesimal\nneighborhoods of the zero section of the universal extension. We also clarify\nhow these constructions naturally express within the language of the\nFourier-Mukai transformation for $\\mathcal D$-modules on abelian schemes. Our\ngeometric perspective moreover permits an interpretation of fundamental formal\nproperties of the logarithm sheaves within the standard theory of the\nPoincar\\'e bundle.

The\nresulting method-of-moments interaction matrix has a block tridiagonal\nstructure, which leads to computational complexity proportional to the number\nof layers for both matrix filling and solution. When all layers are identical,\nthe filling time essentially reduces to that of a single layer, and the\ninteraction matrix has a Toeplitz structure.
