We introduce directed containers to\ncapture the common situation where every position in a data-structure\ndetermines another data-structure, informally, the sub-data-structure rooted by\nthat position. Some natural examples are non-empty lists and node-labelled\ntrees, and data-structures with a designated position (zippers). While\ncontainers denote set functors via a fully-faithful functor, directed\ncontainers interpret fully-faithfully into comonads. But more is true: every\ncomonad whose underlying functor is a container is represented by a directed\ncontainer. In fact, directed containers are the same as containers that are\ncomonads. We also describe some constructions of directed containers.

How to\ndetermine in this case an effective coupling parameter has been a matter of\nintensive debate.

Alternatively, it is directly computed in\ntheoretical models or simulations. Our approach is based on the observation\nthat the build-up of correlation from a weakly coupled system proceeds in two\nsteps: First, a monotonically increasing volume around each particle becomes\ndevoid of other particles (correlation hole), and second (upon further increase\nof the coupling), a shell structure emerges around each particle giving rise to\ngrowing peaks of the RPDF.

Here G is assumed to be invariant under a subgroup K\nof O(n) which acts transitively on the sphere $S^{n-1}$. Tangents to u at a\npoint x are the cluster points of u under a natural flow (or blow-up) at x.\nThey always exist and are G-harmonic at all points of continuity. A homogeneity\nproperty is established for all tangents in these geometric cases. This leads\nto principal results concerning the Strong Uniqueness of Tangents, which means\nthat all tangents are unique and of the form $\\Theta K_p$ where $K_p$ is the\nRiesz kernel and $\\Theta$ is the density of u at the point. Strong uniqueness\nis a form of regularity which implies that the sets $\\{\\Theta(u,x)\\geq c\\}$ for\n$c>0$ are discrete. When the invariance group K= O(n), U(n) or Sp(n), strong\nuniqueness holds for all but a small handful of cases. It also holds for\nessentially all interesting G which arise in calibrated geometry.\n  When strong uniqueness fails, homogeneity implies that tangents are\ncharacterized by a subequation on the sphere, which is worked out in detail. In\nthe cases corresponding to the real, complex and quaternionic Monge-Amp\\`ere\nequations (convex functions, and complex and quaternionic plurisubharmonic\nfunctions) tangents, which are far from unique, are then systematically studied\nand classified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 18:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

We use our implementation\nto compute the ground state potential energy curve of the C$_2$ dimer in the\ncc-pVQZ basis set (with a frozen-core), corresponding to a Hilbert space\ndimension of 10$^{12}$ many-body states. While our calculated energy lies\nwithin the 0.3 mE$_h$ error bound of previous initiator full configuration\ninteraction quantum Monte Carlo (i-FCIQMC) and correlation energy extrapolation\nby intrinsic scaling (CEEIS) calculations, our estimated residual error is only\n0.01 mE$_h$, much more accurate than these previous estimates. Further, due to\nthe additional efficiency afforded by the algorithm, we compute the potential\nenergy curves of twelve states: the three lowest levels for each of the\nirreducible representations $^1\\Sigma^+_g$, $^1\\Sigma^+_u$, $^1\\Sigma^-_g$ and\n$^1\\Sigma^-_u$, to an estimated accuracy within 0.1 mE$_h$ of the exact result\nin this basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 19:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

We calculate the\nfractional contribution of the star-formation and the AGN activity to the\nglobal Halpha, [O II] $\\lambda \\lambda$ 3727,3729 and [O III] $\\lambda$ 5007\nluminosities of each galaxy, and show that both ionization sources contribute\nsignificantly to the emission in all three lines. We use weighted combinations\nof stellar and AGN photoionization models to produce mixing models, which are\nconsistent with observations for 85 percent of spaxels across the galaxies in\nour sample. We also present a new diagnostic for starburst-AGN mixing which\nrequires only the [O II], [O III] and Hbeta emission lines, and can therefore\nbe used to calculate AGN fractions up to z ~ 0.85 in the optical and z ~ 3.5 in\nthe near-infrared. We anticipate that this diagnostic will facilitate studies\nof the properties of AGN ionizing radiation fields and the relative optical\ncontribution of star-formation and AGN activity over cosmic time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 19:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The latter condition\ndepends on the levels of ionisation that characterise the innermost regions of\na collapsing cloud. The chemistry of dense cloud cores and, in particular, the\nionisation fraction is largely controlled by cosmic rays. The aim of this paper\nis to evaluate whether the attenuation of the flux of cosmic rays expected in\nthe regions around a forming protostar is sufficient to decouple the field from\nthe gas, thereby influencing the formation of centrifugally supported disc. We\nadopted the method developed in a former study to compute the attenuation of\nthe cosmic-ray flux as a function of the column density and the field strength\nin clouds threaded by poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields. We applied this\nformalism to models of low- and high-mass star formation extracted from\nnumerical simulations of gravitational collapse that include rotation and\nturbulence. For each model we determine the size of the magnetic decoupling\nzone, where collapse or rotation motion becomes unaffected by the local\nmagnetic field. In general, we find that decoupling only occurs when the\nattenuation of cosmic rays is taken into account with respect to a calculation\nin which the cosmic-ray ionisation rate is kept constant. The extent of the\ndecoupling zone also depends on the dust grain size distribution and is larger\nif large grains (of radius $\\sim 10^{-5}$ cm) are formed by compression and\ncoagulation during cloud collapse. We conclude that a realistic treatment of\ncosmic-ray propagation and attenuation during cloud collapse may lead to a\nvalue of the resistivity of the gas in the innermost few hundred AU around a\nforming protostar that is higher than generally assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 20:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In this paper, we\npropose a straight-forward, objective, model-based algorithm for assigning\nscores to athletic performances for the express purpose of comparing marks\nbetween different events. Specifically, the main score we propose is based on\nthe expected number of athletes who perform better than a given mark within a\ncalendar year. Computing this naturally interpretable statistic requires only a\nlist of the top performances in each event and is not overly dependent on a\nsmall number of marks, such as the world records. We found that this statistic\ncould predict the quality of future performances better than the IAAF scoring\ntables, and is thus better suited for comparing performances from different\nevents. In addition, the probabilistic model used to generate the performance\nscores allows for multiple interpretations which can be adapted for various\npurposes, such as calculating the expected top mark in a given event or\ncalculating the probability of a world record being broken within a certain\ntime period. In this paper, we give the details of the model and the scores, a\ncomparison with the IAAF scoring tables, and...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 20:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-27"}

However, exploiting such platforms for\nexisting scientific applications is not a trivial task. Current GPU programming\nframeworks such as CUDA C/C++ require low-level programming from the developer\nin order to achieve high performance code. As a result porting of applications\nto GPUs is typically limited to time-dominant algorithms and routines, leaving\nthe remainder not accelerated which can open a serious Amdahl's law issue. The\nlattice QCD application Chroma allows to explore a different porting strategy.\nThe layered structure of the software architecture logically separates the\ndata-parallel from the application layer. The QCD Data-Parallel software layer\nprovides data types and expressions with stencil-like operations suitable for\nlattice field theory and Chroma implements algorithms in terms of this\nhigh-level interface. Thus by porting the low-level layer one can effectively\nmove the whole application in one swing to a different platform. The\nQDP-JIT/PTX library, the reimplementation of the low-level layer, provides a\nframework for lattice QCD calculations for the CUDA architecture. The complete\nsoftware interface is supported and thus applications can be run unaltered on\nGPU-based parallel computers. This reimplementation was possible due to the\navailability of a JIT compiler (part of the NVIDIA Linux kernel driver) which\ntranslates an assembly-like language (PTX) to GPU code. The expression template\ntechnique is used to build PTX code generators and a software cache manages the\nGPU memory. This reimplementation allows us to deploy an efficient\nimplementation of the full gauge-generation program with dynamical fermions on\nlarge-scale GPU-based machines such as Titan and Blue Waters which accelerates\nthe algorithm by more than an order of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 20:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-27"}

We find a bright 0.2\narc sec long microjet traced by the emission of shock-excited [FeII]. Beyond\nthe extent of this jet, we find a series of bubbles and fragments of bubbles\nthat are traced in the lower excitation H_2 1-0 S(1) line. While the most\nrecent outflow activity is directed almost precisely (PA ~145 deg) to the\nsouth-east of SVS 13, there is clear indication that prior bubble ejections\nwere pointed in different directions. Within these variations, a clear\nconnection of the newly observed bubble ejection events to the well-known,\npoorly collimated HH 7-11 system of Herbig-Haro objects is established.\nAstrometry of the youngest of the expanding shock fronts at 3 epochs covering a\ntime span of over two years gives kinematic ages for two of these. The\nkinematic age of the youngest bubble is slightly older than the historically\nobserved last photometric outburst of SVS 13 in 1990, consistent with that\nevent launching the bubble and some deceleration of its expansion.

Using the PAH emission, we investigate the\nluminosity relation between star formation and AGN. We find that these infrared\ngalaxies exhibit higher star formation rates than optically selected Seyfert\ngalaxies with the same AGN luminosities, implying that infrared galaxies could\nbe an early evolutionary phase of AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 02:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

As an application, we study static charged\n($D+1$)-dimensional spacetimes in the framework of the healthy\n(non-projectable) Horava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity in the infrared limit, and find\nvarious solutions. Some of them represent Lifshitz space-times with\nhyperscaling violations, and some have black hole structures. In the latter\nuniversal horizons always exist inside the Killing horizons. The surface\ngravity on them can be either larger or smaller than the surface gravity on the\nKilling horizons, depending on the space-times considered.

Traffic\nvariations are more pronounced in a small cell, which in turn lead to more\ndynamic interference to other cells. It is crucial to adapt radio resource\nmanagement to traffic conditions in such a heterogeneous network (HetNet). This\npaper studies the optimization of spectrum allocation in HetNets on a\nrelatively slow timescale based on average traffic and channel conditions\n(typically over seconds or minutes). Specifically, in a cluster with $n$ base\ntransceiver stations (BTSs), the optimal partition of the spectrum into $2^n$\nsegments is determined, corresponding to all possible spectrum reuse patterns\nin the downlink. Each BTS's traffic is modeled using a queue with Poisson\narrivals, the service rate of which is a linear function of the combined\nbandwidth of all assigned spectrum segments. With the system average packet\nsojourn time as the objective, a convex optimization problem is first\nformulated, where it is shown that the optimal allocation divides the spectrum\ninto at most $n$ segments. A second, refined model is then proposed to address\nqueue interactions due to interference, where the corresponding optimal\nallocation problem admits an efficient suboptimal solution. Both allocation\nschemes attain the entire throughput region of a given network. Simulation\nresults show the two schemes perform similarly in the heavy-traffic regime, in\nwhich case they significantly outperform both the orthogonal allocation and the\nfull-frequency-reuse allocation. The refined allocation shows the best\nperformance under all traffic conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 05:23:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 21:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-30"}

In this paper, we build up the systematic method by\ncombining the network structure and spreading dynamics to identify the node\nspreading influence.

We\nemploy master equations and probability generating functions, the latter well\nknown in statistical physics, to derive the dynamics of tumor growth as a\nmean-field approximation.

It is poorly understood how\nthese two classes of planets formed. High solid accretion rates, necessary to\nform the cores of giant planets within the life-time of protoplanetary discs,\nheat the envelope and prevent rapid gas contraction onto the core, unless\naccretion is halted. We find that, in fact, accretion of pebbles (~ cm-sized\nparticles) is self-limiting: when a core becomes massive enough it carves a gap\nin the pebble disc. This halt in pebble accretion subsequently triggers the\nrapid collapse of the super-critical gas envelope. As opposed to gas giants,\nice giants do not reach this threshold mass and can only bind low-mass\nenvelopes that are highly enriched by water vapour from sublimated icy pebbles.\nThis offers an explanation for the compositional difference between gas giants\nand ice giants in the Solar System. Furthermore, as opposed to\nplanetesimal-driven accretion scenarios, our model allows core formation and\nenvelope attraction within disc life-times, provided that solids in\nprotoplanetary discs are predominantly in pebbles. Our results imply that the\nouter regions of planetary systems, where the mass required to halt pebble\naccretion is large, are dominated by ice giants and that gas-giant exoplanets\nin wide orbits are enriched by more than 50 Earth masses of solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 12:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

In orbits beyond 10 AU, direct accumulation\nof planetesimals by the cores is too slow. Fragments of planetesimals could be\naccreted faster, but planetesimals are likely too large for fragmentation to be\nefficient, and resonant trapping poses a further hurdle. Here we instead\ninvestigate the accretion of small pebbles (mm-cm sizes) that are the natural\noutcome of an equilibrium between the growth and radial drift of particles. We\nconstruct a simplified analytical model of dust coagulation and pebble drift in\nthe outer disc, between 5 AU and 100 AU, which gives the temporal evolution of\nthe solid surface density and the dominant particle size. These two key\nquantities determine how core growth proceeds at various orbital distances. We\nfind that pebble surface densities are sufficiently high to achieve the\ninside-out formation of planetary cores within the disc lifetime. The overall\nefficiency by which dust gets converted to planets can be high, close to 50 %\nfor planetary architectures similar to the Solar System. Growth by pebble\naccretion in the outer disc is sufficiently fast to overcome catastrophic Type\nI migration of the cores. These results require protoplanetary discs with large\nradial extent (~100 AU) and assume a low number of initial seed embryos. Our\nfindings imply that protoplanetary discs with low disc masses, as expected\naround low-mass stars (<1 M_sun), or with sub-solar dust-to-gas ratios, do not\neasily form gas-giant planets (M > 100 M_E), but preferentially form\nNeptune-mass planets or smaller (< 10 M_E).

A low-finesse Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) can\nprovide a wavelength comb with a very large bandwidth as required for\nastronomical experiments, but unavoidable spectral drifts are difficult to\ncontrol. Instead of actively controlling the FPI cavity, we propose to\npassively stabilize the interferometer and track the time-dependent cavity\nlength drift externally. A dual-finesse cavity allows drift tracking during\nobservation. The drift of the cavity length is monitored in the high-finesse\nrange relative to an external standard: a single narrow transmission peak is\nlocked to an external cavity diode laser and compared to an atomic frequency.\nFollowing standard locking schemes, tracking at sub-mm/s precision can be\nachieved. This is several orders of magnitude better than currently planned\nhigh-precision Doppler experiments. It allows freedom for relaxed designs\nrendering this approach particularly interesting for upcoming Doppler\nexperiments. We also show that the large number of interference modes used in\nan FPI allows us to unambiguously identify the interference mode of each FPI\ntransmission peak defining its absolute wavelength solution. The accuracy\nreached in each resonance with the laser concept is then defined by the cavity\nlength that is determined from the one locked peak and by the group velocity\ndispersion. The latter can vary by several 100m/s over the relevant frequency\nrange and severely limits the accuracy of individual peak locations. A\npotential way to determine the absolute peak positions is to externally measure\nthe frequency of each individual peak with a laser frequency comb (LFC). Thus,\nthe concept of laser-locked FPIs may be useful for applying the absolute\naccuracy of an LFC to astronomical spectrographs without the need for an LFC at\nthe observatory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 13:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

From the comparison between the ordinary and\nthe randomized level-set methods, it emerges that the proposed modelling\napproach turns out to be suitable to simulate a moving firefront fed by the\nground fuel and driven, beside the meteorological and orographical factors,\nalso by the turbulent diffusion of the hot air.

The\nresulting self-energy is an unconventional sum of self-energy diagrams in which\nthe internal lines of half a diagram are time-ordered Green's functions whereas\nthose of the other half are anti-time-ordered Green's functions, and the lines\njoining the two halves are either lesser or greater Green's functions. The\ntheory is developed using noninteracting Green's functions and subsequently\nextended to self-consistent Green's functions. Issues related to the conserving\nproperties of diagrammatic approximations with positive spectral functions are\nalso addressed. As a major application of the formalism we derive the minimal\nset of additional diagrams to make positive the spectral function of the GW\napproximation with lowest-order vertex corrections and screened interactions.\nThe method is then applied to vertex corrections in the three-dimensional\nhomogeneous electron gas by using a combination of analytical frequency\nintegrations and numerical Monte-Carlo momentum integrations to evaluate the\ndiagrams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 15:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The presence of GRB-SNe is revealed by rebrightenings emerging from\nthe optical GRB afterglow $10$--$15$ days, in the rest-frame of the source,\nafter the prompt GRB emission. Aims: \\textit{Fermi}-GBM has a field of view\n(FoV) which is about 6.5 times larger than the FoV of \\textit{Swift}, therefore\nwe expect that a number of GRB-SN connections have been missed due to lack of\noptical and X-ray instruments on board of \\textit{Fermi}, which are essential\nto reveal SNe associated with GRBs. This fact has motivated our search in the\n\\textit{Fermi} catalogue for possible GRB-SN events. Methods: The search for\npossible GRB-SN associations follows two requirements: (1) SN should fall\ninside the \\textit{Fermi}-GBM error box of the considered long GRB, and (2)\nthis GRB should occur within $20$ days before the SN event. Results: We have\nfound $5$ cases, within $z<0.2$ fulfilling the above reported requirements. One\nof them, GRB 130702A-SN 2013dx, was already known as GRB-SN association. We\nhave analyzed the remaining $4$ cases and we concluded that three of them are,\nvery likely, just random coincidences, due to the \\textit{Fermi}-GBM large\nerror box associated with each GRB detection. We found one GRB possibly\nassociated with a SN 1998bw-like, GRB 120121B/SN 2012ba. Conclusions: The very\nlow redshift of GRB 120121B/SN 2012ba ($z = 0.017$) implies a low isotropic\nenergy of this burst ($E_{iso} = 1.39 \\times 10^{48}$) erg.

Assuming that the cosmological\nconstant depends on the age of the universe in an appropriate manner during the\nphase transition one may recover the predictions of the conventional\ninflationary scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 12:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-28"}
