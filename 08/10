A major influence of the field is to introduce resonances at the\ncyclotron frequency and its harmonics, where the incoming photon accesses\nthresholds for the creation of virtual electrons or positrons in intermediate\nstates with excited Landau levels. At these resonances, the effective cross\nsection typically exceeds the classical Thomson value by over 2 orders of\nmagnitude. Near and above the quantum critical magnetic field of 44.13\nTeraGauss, relativistic corrections must be incorporated when computing this\ncross section. This paper presents formalism for the QED magnetic Compton\ndifferential cross section valid for both subcritical and supercritical fields,\nyet restricted to scattered photons that are below pair creation threshold.\nCalculations are developed for the particular case of photons initially\npropagating along the field, mathematically simple specializations that are\ngermane to interactions involving relativistic electrons frequently found in\nneutron star magnetospheres.

It has been argued that complex contagions better\nmodel behavioral changes such as adoption of new beliefs, fashion trends or\nexpensive technology innovations. This has motivated rigorous understanding of\nspreading of complex contagions in social networks. Despite simple contagions\n($k=1$) that spread fast in all small world graphs, how complex contagions\nspread is much less understood.

The main goal of the paper is to answer the following question: What\ncan we say about the Hausdorff and packing dimension of the fibers of prevalent\ncontinuous maps?\n  Let $K$ be an uncountable compact metric space. We prove that the prevalent\n$f\\in C(K,\\mathbb{R}^d)$ has many fibers with almost maximal Hausdorff\ndimension. This generalizes a theorem of Dougherty and yields that the\nprevalent $f\\in C(K,\\mathbb{R}^d)$ has graph of maximal Hausdorff dimension,\ngeneralizing a result of Bayart and Heurteaux. We obtain similar results for\nthe packing dimension.\n  We show that for the prevalent $f\\in C([0,1]^m,\\mathbb{R}^d)$ the set of\n$y\\in f([0,1]^m)$ for which $\\dim_H f^{-1}(y)=m$ contains a dense open set\nhaving full measure with respect to the occupation measure $\\lambda^m \\circ\nf^{-1}$, where $\\dim_H$ and $\\lambda^m$ denote the Hausdorff dimension and the\n$m$-dimensional Lebesgue measure, respectively. We also prove an analogous\nresult when $[0,1]^m$ is replaced by any self-similar set satisfying the open\nset condition.\n  We cannot replace the occupation measure with Lebesgue measure in the above\nstatement: We show that the functions $f\\in C[0,1]$ for which positively many\nlevel sets are singletons form a non-shy set in $C[0,1]$. In order to do so, we\ngeneralize a theorem of Antunovi\\'c, Burdzy, Peres and Ruscher. As a\ncomplementary result we prove that the functions $f\\in C[0,1]$ for which\n$\\dim_H f^{-1}(y)=1$ for all $y\\in (\\min f,\\max f)$ form a non-shy set in\n$C[0,1]$.\n  We also prove sharper results in which large Hausdorff dimension is replaced\nby positive measure with respect to generalized Hausdorff measures, which\nanswers a problem of Fraser and Hyde.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Aug 2014 02:50:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2015 02:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-02"}

The truncated\nsingular value decomposition (SVD) is known to provide the best such\napproximation for any given fixed rank. However, the SVD is also known to be\nvery costly to compute. Among the different approaches in the literature for\ncomputing low-rank approximations, randomized algorithms have attracted\nresearchers' recent attention due to their surprising reliability and\ncomputational efficiency in different application areas. Typically, such\nalgorithms are shown to compute with very high probability low-rank\napproximations that are within a constant factor from optimal, and are known to\nperform even better in many practical situations. In this paper, we present a\nnovel error analysis that considers randomized algorithms within the subspace\niteration framework and show with very high probability that highly accurate\nlow-rank approximations as well as singular values can indeed be computed\nquickly for matrices with rapidly decaying singular values. Such matrices\nappear frequently in diverse application areas such as data analysis, fast\nstructured matrix computations and fast direct methods for large sparse linear\nsystems of equations and are the driving motivation for randomized methods.\nFurthermore, we show that the low-rank approximations computed by these\nrandomized algorithms are actually rank-revealing approximations, and the\nspecial case of a rank-1 approximation can also be used to correctly estimate\nmatrix 2-norms with very high probability.

We quantify this\ndegeneracy and its dependence on the epoch at which $\\alpha_{M}$ is different\nfrom the standard, zero, value and on the speed of gravitational waves $c_{T}$.\nIn the particular case of scalar-tensor theories, $\\alpha_{M}$ is constant and\nstrongly constrained by background and scalar perturbations, $0\\le \\alpha_{M}<\n0.01$ and the degeneracy with $r$ is removed.

A circular vortex ring exhibits\ninstabilities which have been recognized for many years, but whose precise\nboundaries we determine for the first time analytically in the small core\nlimit. Two circular vortices colliding head-on exhibit stronger instabilities\nwhich cause splitting into many small vortices at late times. We provide an\napproximate analytic treatment of these instabilities and show that the most\nunstable wavelength is parametrically larger than a dynamically generated\nlength scale which in many hydrodynamic systems is close to the cutoff.

A scalar Gaussian wave-packet in transverse plane is\ngeneralized so that it acquires a well-defined z-component of the orbital\nangular momentum (OAM), while may not acquire a typical \"doughnut\" spatial\nprofile. Such quantum states and beams, in contrast to the Bessel ones, may\nhave an azimuthal-angle-dependent probability density and finite quantum\nuncertainty of the OAM, which is determined by the packet's width. We construct\na well-normalized Airy wave-packet, which can be interpreted as a one-particle\nstate for relativistic massive boson, show that its center moves along the same\nquasi-classical straight path and, what is more important, spreads with time\nand distance exactly as a Gaussian wave-packet does, in accordance with the\nuncertainty principle. It is explained that this fact does not contradict the\nwell-known \"non-spreading\" feature of the Airy beams. While the effective OAM\nfor such states is zero, its quantum uncertainty (or the beam's OAM bandwidth)\nis found to be finite, and it depends on the packet's parameters. A link\nbetween exact solutions for the Klein-Gordon equation in the\nnull-plane-variables formalism and the approximate ones in the usual approach\nis indicated, generalizations of these states for a boson in external field of\na plane electromagnetic wave are also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 2014 20:38:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Feb 2015 21:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-05"}
