The excitation enhancement should be observable under\ncurrently-existing experimental conditions, and may serve as a direct probe for\nthe presence of coherent multi-photon dynamics involving collective quantum\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 16:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}

Nowadays\nstate of the art systems use deep learning on millions of labeled images with\nvery successful results on benchmarks, though it is unlikely to expect similar\nresults in unrestricted visual environments. Most learning schemes essentially\nignore the inherent sequential structure of videos: this might be a critical\nissue, since any visual recognition process is remarkably more complex when\nshuffling video frames. Based on this remark, we propose a re-foundation of the\ncommunication protocol between visual agents and the environment, which is\nreferred to as learning to see like children. Like for human interaction,\nvisual concepts are acquired by the agents solely by processing their own\nvisual stream along with human supervisions on selected pixels. We give a proof\nof concept that remarkable semantic labeling can emerge within this protocol by\nusing only a few supervised examples. This is made possible by exploiting a\nconstraint of motion coherent labeling that virtually offers tons of\nsupervisions. Additional visual constraints, including those associated with\nobject supervisions, are used within the context of learning from constraints.\nThe framework is extended in the direction of lifelong learning, so as our\nvisual agents live in their own visual environment without distinguishing\nlearning and test set. Learning takes place in deep architectures under a\nprogressive developmental scheme. In order to evaluate our Developmental Visual\nAgents (DVAs), in addition to classic benchmarks, we open the doors of our lab,\nallowing people to evaluate DVAs by crowd-sourcing. Such assessment mechanism\nmight result in a paradigm shift in methodologies and algorithms for computer\nvision, encouraging truly novel solutions within the proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 17:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-12"}

In our setting, the entries of a Gaussian design matrix are randomly\nsparsified so that only a very small fraction of the entries are nonzero. Our\nproposed decoding algorithm is simple and efficient in that the major cost is\none linear scan of the coordinates. We have developed two estimators: (i) the\n{\\em tie estimator}, and (ii) the {\\em absolute minimum estimator}. Using only\nthe tie estimator, we are able to recover a $K$-sparse signal of length $N$\nusing $1.551 eK \\log K/\\delta$ measurements (where $\\delta\\leq 0.05$ is the\nconfidence). Using only the absolute minimum estimator, we can detect the\nsupport of the signal using $eK\\log N/\\delta$ measurements.

Thus, the two estimators can be\ncombined to form an even more practical decoding framework.\n  Prior studies have shown that existing one-scan (or roughly one-scan)\nrecovery algorithms using sparse matrices would require substantially more\n(e.g., one order of magnitude) measurements than L1 decoding by linear\nprogramming, when the nonzero entries of signals can be either negative or\npositive.

These pebbles can clump together through the\nstreaming instability and form gravitationally bound pebble 'clouds'. Pebbles\ninside such a cloud will undergo mutual collisions, dissipating energy into\nheat. As the cloud loses energy, it gradually contracts towards solid density.\nWe model this process and investigate two important properties of the collapse:\n(i) the timescale of the collapse and (ii) the temporal evolution of the pebble\nsize distribution. Our numerical model of the pebble cloud is zero-dimensional\nand treats collisions with a statistical method. We find that planetesimals\nwith radii larger than 100 km collapse on the free-fall timescale of about 25\nyears. Lower-mass clouds have longer pebble collision timescales and collapse\nmuch more slowly, with collapse times of a few hundred years for 10-km-scale\nplanetesimals and a few thousand years for 1-km-scale planetesimals. The mass\nof the pebble cloud also determines the interior structure of the resulting\nplanetesimal. The pebble collision speeds in low-mass clouds are below the\nthreshold for fragmentation, forming pebble-pile planetesimals consisting of\nthe primordial pebbles from the protoplanetary disk. Planetesimals above 100 km\nin radius, on the other hand, consist of mixtures of dust (pebble fragments)\nand pebbles which have undergone substantial collisions with dust and other\npebbles. The Rosetta mission to the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and the New\nHorizons mission to Pluto will both provide valuable information about the\nstructure of planetesimals in the Solar System. Our model predicts that 67P is\na pebble-pile planetesimal consisting of primordial pebbles from the Solar\nNebula, while the pebbles in the cloud which contracted to form Pluto must have\nbeen ground down substantially during the collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 20:06:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 06:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-15"}

We then explore\nthe dependence of the quenching efficiency of satellites on overdensity,\ngroup-centric distance, halo mass, the stellar mass of the satellite, and the\nstellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR) of its central, trying to\nisolate the effect of these often interdependent variables. We emphasize the\nimportance of the central sSFR in the quenching efficiency of the associated\nsatellites, and develop the meaning of this \"galactic conformity\" effect in a\nprobabilistic description of the quenching of galaxies. We show that conformity\nis strong, and that it varies strongly across parameter space. Several\narguments then suggest that environmental quenching and mass quenching may be\ndifferent manifestations of the same underlying process. The marked difference\nin the apparent mass dependencies of environment quenching and mass quenching\nwhich produces distinctive signatures in the mass functions of centrals and\nsatellites will arise naturally, since, for satellites at least, the\ndistributions of the environmental variables that we investigate in this work\nare essentially independent of the stellar mass of the satellite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 20:40:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2015 11:15:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-17"}

We illustrate our findings by calculating\nthe 21 cm power spectrum in coexistence with a velocity-dependent DM elastic\nscattering cross section.

This paper studies the\nfundamental questions of whether and how the unlicensed spectrum can be shared\nby intrinsically strategic operators without suffering from the tragedy of the\ncommons. A class of general utility functions is considered. The spectrum\nsharing problem is formulated as a repeated game over a sequence of time slots.\nIt is first shown that a simple static sharing scheme allows a given set of\noperators to reach a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium for mutually beneficial\nsharing. The question of how many operators will choose to enter the market is\nalso addressed by studying an entry game. A sharing scheme which allows dynamic\nspectrum borrowing and lending between operators is then proposed to address\ntime-varying traffic and proved to achieve perfect Bayesian equilibrium.\nNumerical results show that the proposed dynamic sharing scheme outperforms\nstatic sharing, which in turn achieves much higher revenue than uncoordinated\nfull-spectrum sharing. Implications of the results to the standardization and\ndeployment of LTE in unlicensed bands (LTE-U) are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 22:11:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2016 20:45:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 02:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-27"}

In the first part of this work, a\nhydrophone was developed for mapping the particle velocity of an acoustic\nfield. This hydrophone was constructed using a thin copper wire and an external\nmagnetic field. A model was elaborated to determine the relationship between\nthe acoustic pressure and the measured electrical current, which is induced by\nLorentz force when the wire vibrates in the acoustic field of an ultrasound\ntransducer. The built prototype was characterized and its spatial resolution,\nfrequency response, sensitivity, robustness and directivity response were\ninvestigated.

In this method, a biological tissue is vibrated by\nultrasound in a magnetic field, which induces an electrical current by Lorentz\nforce. The electrical impedance of the tissue can be deduced from the\nmeasurement of the current. This technique was applied for imaging a gelatin\nphantom, a beef muscle sample, and a thermal lesion in a chicken breast sample.\nThis showed the method may be useful for providing additional contrast to\nconventional ultrasound imaging.

The speed of the shear waves were used to compute elasticity and\ntheir source to map the electrical conductivity of the samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 22:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-13"}

It is often challenging, however, to discover these relationships\nacross a large and diverse superfamily. Contemporary similarity network\nvisualization techniques allow researchers to aggregate sequence similarity\ninformation into a single global view. Network visualization provides a\nqualitative estimate of functional diversity within a superfamily, but is\nunable to quantitate explicit boundaries, when present, between neighboring\nfamilies in sequence space. This limits the potential of existing\nsequence-based algorithms to generate functional predictions from superfamily\ndatasets.\n  Results: By building on current network analysis tools, we have developed a\nnew algorithm for elucidating pairs of homologous families within a sequence\ndataset. Our algorithm is able to filter through a dense similarity network in\norder to estimate both the boundaries of individual families and also how the\nfamilies neighbor one another. Globally, these neighboring families define a\ntopology across the entire superfamily. The topology is simple to interpret by\nvisualizing the network output generated by our filtration protocol. We have\ncompared the network topology within the kinase superfamily against available\nphylogenetic data. Our results suggest that neighbors within the filtered\nkinase network are more likely to share structural and functional properties\nthan more distant network clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 22:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-13"}

Of particular\ninterest are compact and low-power relaxation oscillators that have been\nrecently demonstrated using MIT (metal- insulator-transition) devices using\nproperties of correlated oxides. This paper presents an analysis of the\ndynamics and synchronization of a system of two such identical coupled\nrelaxation oscillators implemented with MIT devices. We focus on two\nimplementations of the oscillator: (a) a D-D configuration where complementary\nMIT devices (D) are connected in series to provide oscillations and (b) a D-R\nconfiguration where it is composed of a resistor (R) in series with a\nvoltage-triggered state changing MIT device (D). The MIT device acts like a\nhysteresis resistor with different resistances in the two different states. The\nsynchronization dynamics of such a system has been analyzed with purely charge\nbased coupling using a resistive (Rc) and a capacitive (Cc) element in\nparallel. It is shown that in a D-D configuration symmetric, identical and\ncapacitively coupled relaxation oscillator system synchronizes to an anti-phase\nlocking state, whereas when coupled resistively the system locks in phase.\nFurther, we demonstrate that for certain range of values of Rc and Cc, a\nbistable system is possible which can have potential applications in\nassociative computing. In D-R configuration, we demonstrate the existence of\nrich dynamics including non-monotonic flows and complex phase relationship\ngoverned by the ratios of the coupling impedance.

Whereas part of the scalar field is\nabsorbed/scattered by the black hole and triggers gravitational wave emission,\nanother part lingers in long-lived quasi-bound states. Solving numerically the\nTeukolsky master equation for gravitational perturbations coupled to the\nmassive Klein-Gordon equation, we find a characteristic gravitational wave\nsignal, composed by a quasi-normal ringing followed by a late time tail. In\ncontrast to `clean' black holes, however, the late time tail contains small\namplitude wiggles with the frequency of the dominating quasi-bound state.\nAdditionally, an observer dependent beating pattern may also be seen. These\nfeatures were already observed in fully non-linear studies; our analysis shows\nthey are present at linear level, and, since it reduces to a 1+1 dimensional\nnumerical problem, allows for cleaner numerical data. Moreover, we discuss the\npower law of the tail and that it only becomes universal sufficiently far away\nfrom the `dirty' black hole. The wiggly tails, by constrast, are a generic\nfeature that may be used as a smoking gun for the presence of massive fields\naround black holes, either as a linear cloud or as fully non-linear hair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 00:29:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-24"}

Currently,\nmany researchers resort to microarray technology for identifying relevant\ngenetic prognostic markers, with particular attention on trimming or extending\na Cox regression model.\n  Among NSCLC, adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are two\nmajor histology subtypes.

However, the measured spins of BHs in\nLMXBs cover the whole range of spin parameters. We propose here that the BH\nspin in LMXBs is acquired through accretion onto the BH after its formation. In\norder to test this hypothesis, we calculated extensive grids of detailed binary\nmass-transfer sequences.

Our numerical results predict\nthat the spatial asymmetry affects considerably both the energy transfer and\ndrag rates as a result of changes in plasmon modes.

Finally, our approach\ndescribing generation of complex optical fields via coupling with topological\ndefect lines in optically birefringent nematic fluids can be easily extended to\nhigh-intensity beams that affect nematic ordering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 12:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The seven hidden dimensions are compactified within a radius\nestimated by reproducing the particle - wave characteristic of diffraction\nexperiments. In the presence of matter fields the gravitational field develops\nlocalized modes with elementary excitations called gravonons which are induced\nby the sources (massive particles). The final world model treated here contains\nonly gravonons and a scalar matter field. The solution of the Schroedinger\nequation for the world model yields matter fields which are localized in the 4\ndimensional subspace. The localization has the following properties: (i) There\nis a chooser mechanism for the selection of the localization site. (ii) The\nchooser selects one site on the basis of minor energy differences and\ndifferences in the gravonon structure between the sites, which appear\nstatistical.

The difficulty lies in the fact that consistency of\noverdetermined systems is not a continuous property. Our certification is based\non hybrid symbolic-numeric methods to compute the exact \"rational univariate\nrepresentation\" (RUR) of a component of the input system from approximate\nroots. For overdetermined polynomial systems with simple roots, we compute an\ninitial RUR from approximate roots. The accuracy of the RUR is increased via\nNewton iterations until the exact RUR is found, which we certify using exact\narithmetic. Since the RUR is well-constrained, we can use it to certify the\ngiven approximate roots using alpha-theory. To certify isolated singular roots,\nwe use a determinantal form of the \"isosingular deflation\", which adds new\npolynomials to the original system without introducing new variables. The\nresulting polynomial system is overdetermined, but the roots are now simple,\nthereby reducing the problem to the overdetermined case.

This\nproblem arises naturally in a number of power systems contexts, most\nimportantly in the context of direct methods for transient stability analysis\nand voltage stability assessment. We introduce a novel form of homotopy\ncontinuation method called the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation\n(NPHC) method that is mathematically guaranteed to find all the solutions\nwithout ever encountering a bifurcation. The method is based on embedding the\nreal form of power flow equation in complex space, and tracking the generally\nunphysical solutions with complex values of real and imaginary parts of the\nvoltage. The solutions converge to physical real form in the end of the\nhomotopy. The so-called $\\gamma$-trick mathematically rigorously ensures that\nall the paths are well-behaved along the paths, so unlike other continuation\napproaches, no special handling of bifurcations is necessary. The method is\n\\textit{embarrassingly parallelizable} and can be applied to reasonably large\nsized systems. We demonstrate the technique by analysis of several standard\ntest cases up to the 14-bus system size. Finally, we discuss possible\nstrategies for scaling the method to large size systems, and propose several\napplications for transient stability analysis and voltage stability assessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 15:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-13"}

Responsible\nfor the speed-up is a subroutine called the quantum order finding algorithm\n(QOFA) which calculates the order -- the smallest integer, $r$, satisfying $a^r\n\\mod N =1$, where $a$ is a randomly chosen integer coprime to $N$ (meaning\ntheir greatest common divisor is one, $\\gcd(a, N) =1$). Given $r$, and with\nprobability not less than $1/2$, the factors are given by $p_1 = \\gcd\n(a^{\\frac{r}{2}} - 1, N)$ and $p_2 = \\gcd (a^{\\frac{r}{2}} + 1, N)$.

We present two techniques for retrieving the order from apparently\nuseless runs of the QOFA: not discarding odd orders; and looking out for new\norder finding relations in the case of failure.

Even still, our techniques may be useful\nin the near future, while demonstrations are restricted to factoring small\nnumbers.

An additional average\nspeed-up of 75% can be obtained by stopping the solver at an early stage,\nwithout deterioration of the plan quality. For a fixed catheter configuration,\nthe dwell time optimization model LP solves to optimality in less than 15\nseconds, which confirms earlier results. We propose an iterative procedure for\nQP that allows to prescribe the target dose as an interval, while retaining\nindependence between the solution time and the number of dose calculation\npoints. This iterative procedure is comparable in speed to the LP model, and\nproduces better plans than the non-iterative QP.\n  We formulate a new dose-volume based model that maximizes $V_{100\\%}$ while\nsatisfying pre-set DVH-criteria. This model optimizes both catheter positions\nand dwell times within a few minutes depending on prostate volume and number of\ncatheters, optimizes dwell times within 35 seconds, and gives better DVH\nstatistics than dose-based models.

We address it in the adiabatic harmonic approximation, based\non first principles (e.g. Density-Functional Theory), from different points of\nview: directly from atomic position fluctuations or, alternatively, from\nJanak's theorem generalized to the case where the Helmholtz free energy,\nincluding the vibrational entropy, is used. We prove their equivalence, based\non the usual form of Janak's theorem and on the dynamical equation. We then\nalso place the Allen-Heine-Cardona (AHC) theory of the renormalization in a\nfirst-principle context. The AHC theory relies on the rigid-ion approximation,\nand naturally leads to a self-energy (Fan) contribution and a Debye-Waller\ncontribution. Such a splitting can also be done for the complete harmonic\nadiabatic expression, in which the rigid-ion approximation is not required. A\nnumerical study within the Density-Functional Perturbation theory framework\nallows us to compare the AHC theory with frozen-phonon calculations, with or\nwithout the rigid-ion terms. For the two different numerical approaches without\nrigid-ion terms, the agreement is better than 7 $\\mu$eV in the case of diamond,\nwhich represent an agreement to 5 significant digits. The magnitude of the non\nrigid-ion terms in this case is also presented, distinguishing specific phonon\nmodes contributions to different electronic eigenenergies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 15:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

Consequently, flexible methodology that provides accurate\nestimation across a wide range of processes is a subject of ongoing interest.\nWe propose a novel approach to model-based time-frequency estimation using\ntime-varying autoregressive models. In this context, we take a fully Bayesian\napproach and allow both the autoregressive coefficients and innovation variance\nto vary over time. Importantly, our estimation method uses the lattice filter\nand is cast within the partial autocorrelation domain. The marginal posterior\ndistributions are of standard form and, as a convenient by-product of our\nestimation method, our approach avoids undesirable matrix inversions. As such,\nestimation is extremely computationally efficient and stable. To illustrate the\neffectiveness of our approach, we conduct a comprehensive simulation study that\ncompares our method with other competing methods and find that, in most cases,\nour approach performs superior in terms of average squared error between the\nestimated and true time-varying spectral density. Lastly, we demonstrate our\nmethodology through three modeling applications; namely, insect communication\nsignals, environmental data (wind components), and macroeconomic data (US gross\ndomestic product (GDP) and consumption).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 15:58:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-13"}

These techniques\ncan also be applied to food and nutrition, which must be studied to design\nhealthy diets. Using nutritional information from over 1,000 raw foods, we\nsystematically evaluated the nutrient composition of each food in regards to\nsatisfying daily nutritional requirements. The nutrient balance of a food was\nquantified herein as nutritional fitness, using the food's frequency of\noccurrence in nutritionally adequate food combinations. Nutritional fitness\noffers prioritization of recommendable foods within a global network of foods,\nin which foods are connected based on the similarities of their nutrient\ncompositions. We identified a number of key nutrients, such as choline and\nalpha-linolenic acid, whose levels in foods can critically affect the foods'\nnutritional fitness. Analogously, pairs of nutrients can have the same effect.\nIn fact, two nutrients can impact the nutritional fitness synergistically,\nalthough the individual nutrients alone may not. This result, involving the\ntendency among nutrients to show correlations in their abundances across foods,\nimplies a hidden layer of complexity when exploring for foods whose balance of\nnutrients within pairs holistically helps meet nutritional requirements.\nInterestingly, foods with high nutritional fitness successfully maintain this\nnutrient balance. This effect expands our scope to a diverse repertoire of\nnutrient-nutrient correlations, integrated under a common network framework\nthat yields unexpected yet coherent associations between nutrients. Our\nnutrient-profiling approach combined with a network-based analysis provides a\nmore unbiased, global view of the relationships between foods and nutrients,\nand can be extended towards nutritional policies, food marketing, and\npersonalized nutrition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 2014 17:21:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2015 14:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-17"}
