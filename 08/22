Another basic tool\nto determine the mass of a system of stars or galaxies comes from the study of\ntheir motion, as Newton demonstrated with his law of gravitation, which yields\nthe {\\em gravitational mass}. Because the luminous mass can at best only\nrepresent a portion of the gravitational mass, finding the luminous mass to be\ndifferent or less than the gravitational mass should not be surprising.

In D space dimensions\nit involves a (D-1)-form fictitious pseudovector gauge field which originates\nfrom the condensation of topological defects in compact low-energy effective BF\ntheories. In the average field approximation, the corresponding uniform\nemergent charge creates a gap for the (D-2)-dimensional branes via the Magnus\nforce, the dual of the Lorentz force. One particular combination of intrinsic\nand emergent charge fluctuations that leaves the total charge distribution\ninvariant constitutes an isolated gapless mode leading to superfluidity. The\nremaining massive modes organise themselves into a D-dimensional charged,\nmassive vector. There is no massive Higgs scalar as there is no local order\nparameter. When electromagnetism is switched on, the photon acquires mass by\nthe topological BF mechanism. Although the charge of the gapless mode (2) and\nthe topological order (4) are the same as those of the standard Higgs model,\nthe two models of superconductivity are clearly different since the origins of\nthe gap, reflected in the high-energy sectors are totally different. In 2D this\ntype of superconductivity is explicitly realized as global superconductivity in\nJosephson junction arrays. In 3D this model predicts a possible phase\ntransition from topological insulators to Higgsless superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 17:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 10:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

As such, GRBs provide a unique tool for\nstudying star forming galaxies out to high-z independent of luminosity. Most of\nour understanding of the properties of GRB hosts (GRBHs) comes from optical and\nnear-infrared (NIR) follow-up observations, and we therefore have relatively\nlittle knowledge of the fraction of dust-enshrouded star formation that resides\nwithin GRBHs. Currently ~20% of GRBs show evidence of significant amounts of\ndust along the line of sight to the afterglow through the host galaxy, and\nthese GRBs tend to reside within redder and more massive galaxies than GRBs\nwith optically bright afterglows. In this paper we present Herschel\nobservations of five GRBHs with evidence of being dust-rich, targeted to\nunderstand the dust attenuation properties within GRBs better. Despite the\nsensitivity of our Herschel observations, only one galaxy in our sample was\ndetected (GRBH 070306), for which we measure a total star formation rate (SFR)\nof ~100Mstar/yr, and which had a relatively high stellar mass\n(log[Mstar]=10.34+0.09/-0.04). Nevertheless, when considering a larger sample\nof GRBHs observed with Herschel, it is clear that stellar mass is not the only\nfactor contributing to a Herschel detection, and significant dust extinction\nalong the GRB sightline (A_{V,GRB}>1.5~mag) appears to be a considerably better\ntracer of GRBHs with high dust mass. This suggests that the extinguishing dust\nalong the GRB line of sight lies predominantly within the host galaxy ISM, and\nthus those GRBs with A_{V,GRB}>1~mag but with no host galaxy Herschel\ndetections are likely to have been predominantly extinguished by dust within an\nintervening dense cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 17:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

For linear regression, a small, manageable set of data rows can be\nrandomly selected to approximate a tall, skinny data matrix, improving\nprocessing time significantly. For theoretical performance guarantees, each row\nmust be sampled with probability proportional to its statistical leverage\nscore. Unfortunately, leverage scores are difficult to compute.\n  A simple alternative is to sample rows uniformly at random. While this often\nworks, uniform sampling will eliminate critical row information for many\nnatural instances. We take a fresh look at uniform sampling by examining what\ninformation it does preserve. Specifically, we show that uniform sampling\nyields a matrix that, in some sense, well approximates a large fraction of the\noriginal. While this weak form of approximation is not enough for solving\nlinear regression directly, it is enough to compute a better approximation.\n  This observation leads to simple iterative row sampling algorithms for matrix\napproximation that run in input-sparsity time and preserve row structure and\nsparsity at all intermediate steps.

High resolution Chandra X-ray\nobservations show a cold front in Abell 3667. At radio wavelengths, Abell 3667\nreveals a double radio-relic feature in the outskirts of the cluster. These\nsuggest multiple merger events in this cluster. In this paper, we analyze the\nsubstantial archival X-ray observations of Abell 3667 from ChandraX-ray\nObservatory and compare these with existing radio observations as well as\nstate-of-the-art AMR (Adaptive Mesh Refinement) MHD cosmological simulations\nusing Enzo. We have used two temperature map making techniques, Weighted\nVoronoi Tessellation and Adaptive Circular Binning, to produce the high\nresolution and largest field-of-view temperature maps of Abell 3667. These high\nfidelity temperature maps allow us to study the X-ray shocks in the cluster\nusing a new 2-dimensional shock-finding algorithm. We have also estimated the\nMach numbers from the shocks inferred from previous ATCA radio observations.\nThe combined shock statistics from the X-ray and radio data are in agreement\nwith the shock statistics in a simulated MHD cluster. We have also studied the\nprofiles of the thermodynamic properties across the cold front using 447 ksec\nfrom the combined Chandra observations on Abell 3667. Our results show that the\nstability of the cold front in Abell 3667 can be attributed to the suppression\nof the thermal conduction across the cold front by a factor of 100 - 700\ncompared to the classical Spitzer value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 19:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Our goal\nis to investigate how the polarization degree and angle correlate with the\ncloud and core gas. We use optical, near infrared and submillimeter\npolarization observations toward the starless object Pipe-109 in the Pipe\nnebula. Our data cover a physical scale range of 0.08 to 0.4 pc, comprising the\ndense gas, envelope and the surrounding cloud. The cloud polarization is well\ntraced by the optical data. The near infrared polarization is produced by a\nmixed population of grains from the core border and the cloud gas. The optical\nand near infrared polarization toward the cloud reach the maximum possible\nvalue and saturate with respect to the visual extinction. The core polarization\nis predominantly traced by the submillimeter data and have a steep decrease\nwith respect to the visual extinction.

These have\nAGN-ionized gas projected >10 kpc from the nucleus, and significant shortfall\nof ionizing radiation between the distant gas and the AGN, indicating fading\nAGN on ~50,000-year timescales. Every system shows evidence of ongoing or past\ninteractions; a similar sample of obscured AGN with extended ionized clouds\nshares this incidence of disturbances. Several systems show multiple dust lanes\nin different orientations, broadly fit by differentially precessing disks of\naccreted material ~1.5 Gyr after initial arrival. The gas has lower metallicity\nthan the nuclei; three systems have abundances uniformly well below solar,\nconsistent with an origin in tidally disrupted low-luminosity galaxies, while\nsome systems have more nearly solar abundances (accompanied by such signatures\nas multiple Doppler components), which may suggest redistribution of gas by\noutflows within the host galaxies themselves. These aspects are consistent with\na tidal origin for the extended gas in most systems, although the ionized gas\nand stellar tidal features do not always match closely. In contrast to clouds\nnear radio-loud AGN, these are dominated by rotation, in some cases in warped\ndisks.

Though\ncounterintuitive, this assertion follows directly from stellar tidal\ninteraction theory and the evolution of lower mass stars. There is strong\nevidence that chromospheric activity of rapidly rotating young stars may be\nhigh enough to cause mass loss from atmospheres of potentially habitable\nplanets. The removal of atmospheric water is most critical. Tidal breaking in\nbinaries could help reduce magnetic dynamo action and thereby chromospheric\nactivity in favor of life. We call this the Binary Habitability Mechanism\n(BHM), that we suggest allows for water retention at levels comparable to or\nbetter than Earth. We discuss novel advantages that life may exploit, in these\ncases, and suggest that life may even thrive on some circumbinary planets. We\nfind that while many binaries do not benefit from BHM, high quality niches do\nexist for various combinations of stars between 0.55 and 1.0 solar masses. For\na given pair of stellar masses, BHM operates only for certain combinations of\nperiod and eccentricity.

The removal efficiency of an element\n(e.g., Fe, Mg, and Ca) through radiation-driven dust wind in a galaxy is\nassumed to depend both on the dust depletion level of the element in\ninterstellar medium and the total luminosity of the galaxy in the new model. We\nparticularly focus on the time evolution of [alpha/Fe] and its dependence on\nmodel parameters for dust wind in this study. The principal results are as\nfollows. The time evolution of [Ca/Fe] is significantly different between\nmodels with and without dust wind in the sense that [Ca/Fe] can be\nsystematically lower in the models with dust wind. The time evolution of\n[Mg/Fe], on the other hand, can not be so different between the models with and\nwithout dust wind owing to the lower level of dust depletion for Mg. As a\nresult of this, [Mg/Ca] can be systematically higher in the models with dust\nwind. We compare these results with the observed elemental features of stars in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), because a growing number of observational\nstudies on [alpha/Fe] for the LMC have been recently accumulated for a detailed\ncomparison.

Recent works have revealed a new set of \"zero-determinant (ZD)\"\nstrategies, which is an important advance in repeated games. A ZD strategy\nplayer can exert a unilaterally control on two players' payoffs. In particular\nhe can deterministically set the opponent's payoff, or enforce an unfair linear\nrelationship between the players' payoffs, thereby always seizing an\nadvantageous share of payoffs. One of the limitations of the original ZD\nstrategy, however, is that it does not capture the notion of robustness when\nthe game is subjected to stochastic errors. In this paper, we propose a general\nmodel of ZD strategies for noisy repeated games, and find that ZD strategies\nhave high robustness against errors. We further derive the pinning strategy\nunder noise, by which the ZD strategy player coercively set the opponent's\nexpected payoff to his desired level, although his payoff control ability\ndeclines with the increase of noise strength. Due to the uncertainty caused by\nnoise, the ZD strategy player cannot secure his payoff to be higher than the\nopponent's, which implies strong extortions do not exist even under low noise.\nWhile we show that the ZD strategy player can still establish a novel kind of\nextortions, named weak extortions, where any increase of his own payoff always\nexceeds that of the opponent's by a fixed percentage, and the conditions under\nwhich the weak extortions can be realized are more stringent as the noise\nbecomes stronger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 06:02:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Feb 2015 10:35:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 02:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In this paper we intend to\n\"explain\" not the pattern itself but rather its changes across countries and in\nthe course of time. First, we show that the fairly common idea according to\nwhich this pattern is decaying in \"modern\" societies is not altogether true.\nFor instance, around 2000, in well urbanized countries like South Korea or\nSpain this pattern was still as strong as it was in France (and other European\ncountries) in the late 19th century. The method that we use in order to make\nsome progress in our understanding is the time-honoured Cartesian approach of\nbreaking up the problem under consideration \"into as many parts as might be\nnecessary to solve it\". More specifically, we try two decompositions of monthly\nsuicides: (i) according to suicide methods (ii) according to age-groups.\n  The first decomposition points out the key-role of hanging and drowning. The\nsecond shows the crucial role of the $ 15-20 $ and $ 65+ $ age-groups. Then, we\npresent a number of cases in which age-group decomposition provides adequate\npredictions. It turns out that the cases in which the predictions do not work\nare newly urbanized countries. The discrepancies may be due to a memory effect\nwhich induces a time-lag extending over one or two generations. Finally, in the\nlight of the new results presented in the present paper, we re-examine the\ntheory proposed by Emile Durkheim.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 09:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-25"}

From the cellular operator's perspective, by\nassuming a usage-based charging model, we formulate the problem as a utility\nmaximization problem. In particular, we consider three scenarios: (i)\nsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) available at both the base station\n(BS) and the AP; (ii) SIC available at neither the BS nor the AP; (iii) SIC\navailable at only the BS.

We provide\na formula that quantifies the systematic error in the estimated mass with\nrespect to the true one as a function of the galaxy shape and line of sight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 10:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-25"}

This pulsar shows two relatively\nstable states: a Bright (B) and Quiet (Q) mode, each with different\ncharacteristic brightness, profile morphology, and single-pulse properties. We\nmodel the average profile evolution both in frequency and time from the onset\nof each mode, and highlight the differences between the two modes. In both\nmodes, the profile evolution can be well explained by radius-to-frequency\nmapping at altitudes within a few hundred kilometres of the stellar surface. If\nboth B and Q-mode emission originate at the same magnetic latitude, then we\nfind that the change of emission height between the modes is less than 6%. We\nalso find that, during B-mode, the average profile is gradually shifting\ntowards later spin phase and then resets its position at the next Q-to-B\ntransition. The observed B-mode profile delay is frequency-independent (at\nleast from 25-80 MHz) and asymptotically changes towards a stable value of\nabout 0.004 in spin phase by the end of mode instance, much too large to be due\nto changing spin-down rate.

Another interesting\nexplanation is a possible variation of accelerating potential inside the polar\ngap. This explanation connects the observed profile delay to the gradually\nevolving subpulse drift rate, which depends on the gradient of the potential\nacross the field lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 12:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

This results in the possibility of two surfaces with\ndifferent roughness, different surface energy and thus different underlying\nwetting mechanisms exhibiting the same contact angle. We introduce the\nutilization of dynamic wetting experiments as an additional surface probe which\nallows a better characterization of superhydrophobic surfaces. A theoretical\nmodel is presented which describes the spreading of water jets on a\nsuperhydrophobic surface and allows the determination of the wetted fraction of\na heterogeneously wetted superhydrophobic surface. The determined values for\nthe wetted fraction identify a common problem when building artificial super\nhydrophobic surfaces and can fundamentally improve their understanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 12:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-25"}

Earthlike circumbinary planets inhabited by photosynthetic\norganisms will be forced to adapt to these unusual flux patterns.\n  We map the flux received by putative Earthlike planets (as a function of\nsurface latitude/longitude and time) orbiting the binary star systems Kepler-16\nand Kepler-47, two star systems which already boast circumbinary exoplanet\ndetections. The longitudinal and latitudinal distribution of flux is sensitive\nto the centre of mass motion of the binary, and the relative orbital phases of\nthe binary and planet. Total eclipses of the secondary by the primary, as well\nas partial eclipses of the primary by the secondary add an extra forcing term\nto the system.

It\nemerged at a significance level of 8.5 standard deviations after restricting\nthe analysis to events with energies above 4 TeV.

Accordingly, a wide repertoire\nof pattern recognition tools, such as classifiers and knowledge discovery\nprocedures, are nowadays available and tested for various datasets of labeled\ngraphs. However, the design of effective learning procedures operating in the\nspace of labeled graphs is still a challenging problem, especially from the\ncomputational complexity viewpoint. In this paper, we present a major\nimprovement of a general-purpose classifier for graphs, which is conceived on\nan interplay between dissimilarity representation, clustering,\ninformation-theoretic techniques, and evolutionary optimization algorithms. The\nimprovement focuses on a specific key subroutine devised to compress the input\ndata.

However,\ncalculations of the lifetime of the SM vacuum have shown that it vastly exceeds\nthe age of the Universe. It was pointed out by two of us (VB,EM) that these\ncalculations are extremely sensitive to effects from Planck scale\nhigher-dimensional operators and, without knowledge of these operators, firm\nconclusions about the lifetime of the SM vacuum cannot be drawn. The previous\npaper used analytical approximations to the potential and, except for Higgs\ncontributions, ignored loop corrections to the bounce action. In this work, we\ndo not rely on any analytical approximations and consider all contributions to\nthe bounce action, confirming the earlier result. It is surprising that the\nPlanck scale operators can have such a large effect when the instability is at\n$10^{11}$ GeV. There are two reasons for the size of this effect. In typical\ntunneling calculations, the value of the field at the center of the critical\nbubble is much larger than the point of the instability; in the SM case, this\nturns out to be numerically within an order of magnitude of the Planck scale.\nIn addition, tunneling is an inherently non-perturbative phenomenon, and may\nnot be as strongly suppressed by inverse powers of the Planck scale. We include\neffective $\\Phi^6$ and $\\Phi^8$ Planck-scale operators and show that they can\nhave an enormous effect on the tunneling rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 14:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This complexity is usually modeled\ndirectly, obscuring the underlying physics, which can often be characterized by\na small number of physical parameters. In this paper, we derive a closed-form\nexpression for a low dimensional model that reproduces the stochastic dynamical\nevolution of time-dependent failure in heterogeneous materials, and efficiently\ncaptures the spatial fluctuations and critical behavior near failure. Our\nconstruction is based on a novel time domain formulation of Fiber Bundle\nModels, which represent spatial variations in material strength via lattices of\nbrittle, viscoelastic fiber elements. We apply the inverse transform method of\nrandom number sampling in order to construct an exact stochastic jump process\nfor the failure sequence in a material with arbitrary strength distributions.\nWe also complement this with a mean field approximation that captures the\ncoupled constitutive dynamics, and validate both with numerical simulations.\nOur method provides a compact representation of random fiber lattices with\narbitrary failure distributions, even in the presence of rapid loading and\nnontrivial fiber dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 14:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-25"}

A\nmore limited version of this hypothesis, dubbed the E-belt hypothesis,\npostulates that a destabilized contiguous inner extension of the main asteroid\nbelt produced a bombardment limited to those craters younger than Nectaris\nbasin. We investigate these hypotheses with a Monte Carlo code called the\nCratered Terrain Evolution Model (CTEM). We find that matching the observed\nnumber of lunar highlands craters with Dc~100 km requires that the total number\nof impacting asteroids with Di>10 km be no fewer than 4x10-6 km-2. However,\nthis required mass of impactors has <1% chance of producing only a single basin\nlarger than the ~1200 km Imbrium basin; instead, these simulations are likely\nto produce more large basins than are observed on the Moon. This difficulty in\nreproducing the lunar highlands cratering record with a main asteroid belt SFD\narises because the main belt is relatively abundant in the objects that produce\nthese \"megabasins\" that are larger than Imbrium. We also find that the main\nasteroid belt SFD has <16% chance of producing Nectarian densities of Dc>64 km\ncraters while not producing a crater larger than Imbrium, as required by the\nE-belt hypothesis. These results suggest that the lunar highlands were unlikely\nto have been bombarded by a population whose size-frequency distribution\nresembles that of the currently observed main asteroid belt. We suggest that\nthe population of impactors that cratered the lunar highlands had a somewhat\nsimilar size-frequency distribution as the modern main asteroid belt, but had a\nsmaller ratio of objects capable of producing megabasins compared to objects\ncapable of producing ~100 km craters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 14:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Recent work has established the classical capacity of all of these\nchannels, and furthermore, it is now known that a strong converse theorem holds\nfor the classical capacity of these channels under a particular photon number\nconstraint. The goal of the present paper is to initiate the study of\nsecond-order coding rates for these channels, by beginning with the simplest\none, the pure-loss bosonic channel. In a second-order analysis of\ncommunication, one fixes the tolerable error probability and seeks to\nunderstand the back-off from capacity for a sufficiently large yet finite\nnumber of channel uses. We find a lower bound on the maximum achievable code\nsize for the pure-loss bosonic channel, in terms of the known expression for\nits capacity and a quantity called channel dispersion. We accomplish this by\nproving a general \"one-shot\" coding theorem for channels with classical inputs\nand pure-state quantum outputs which reside in a separable Hilbert space. The\ntheorem leads to an optimal second-order characterization when the channel\noutput is finite-dimensional, and it remains an open question to determine\nwhether the characterization is optimal for the pure-loss bosonic channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 15:32:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Apr 2015 03:48:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 14:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

We focus on properly accounting for the\nvoid-in-cloud effect, i.e., the growth of those voids sitting in over-dense\nregions may be restricted by the evolution of their surroundings. This effect\nmay change the distribution function of voids hence affect predictions on the\ndifferences between modified gravity and GR. We show that the thin-shell\napproximation usually used to calculate the fifth force is qualitatively good\nbut quantitatively inaccurate. Therefore, it is necessary to numerically solve\nthe fifth force in both over-dense and under-dense regions. We then generalise\nthe Eulerian void assignment method of Paranjape, Lam and Sheth (2012) to our\nmodified gravity model. We implement this method in our Monte Carlo simulations\nand compare its results with the original Lagrangian methods. We find that the\nabundances of small voids are significantly reduced in both modified gravity\nand GR due to the restriction of environments. However, the change in void\nabundances for the range of void radii of interest for both models is similar.\nTherefore, the difference between models remains similar to the results from\nthe Lagrangian method, especially if correlated steps of the random walks are\nused. As Clampitt, Cai and Li (2013), we find that the void abundance is much\nmore sensitive to modified gravity than halo abundances.

A Ruelle operator framework is employed to show there is a phase\ntransition when the temperature varies in the following senses: the pressure is\nnot analytic, there are multiple eigenprobabilities for the dual of the Ruelle\noperator, the DLR-Gibbs measure is not unique and finally the Thermodynamic\nLimit is not unique. Additionally, we explicitly calculate the critical points\nfor these phase transitions. Some examples which are not of Hofbauer type are\nalso considered. The non-uniqueness of the Thermodynamic Limit is proved by\nconsidering a version of a Renewal Equation. We also show that the correlations\ndecay polynomially and that each one of these Hofbauer potentials is a fixed\npoint for a certain renormalization transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 15:59:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2015 14:34:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 18:28:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 19:54:23 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 15:21:04 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2015 14:03:52 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 8 May 2015 18:08:08 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 16:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

We\nclustered the tweets using k-means, a commonly used clustering algorithm, and\nNon-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and compared the results.

The physical, unconditionally secure key\nis not used for data encryption but is employed in order to generate and share\na new software-based key without any known-plain-text component. The\nsoftware-only-based key distribution is then changed from computationally\nsecure to unconditionally secure, because the communicated key-exchange data\n(algorithm parameters, one-way functions of random numbers, etc.) are encrypted\nin an unconditionally secure way with a one-time-pad.
