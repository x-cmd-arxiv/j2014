Here, I consider the radial and vertical\nstructure of a nearly free-falling flow inside the last stable orbit of a thin\ndisc around a Kerr black hole. The thickness of such a flow is determined\nprimarily by the vertical stress created by radial and azimuthal magnetic\nfields. The thickness is predicted to oscillate vertically around its\nequilibrium value determined by the magnetic field balance with gravity. For\nthin discs, this thickness is much larger than that of the accretion disc\nitself. Numerical simulations with HARM2d show the vertical structure is more\ncomplicated. In particular, magnetically supported disc seems to be unstable to\nsegregation of matter into thinner streams with the vertical scale determined\nby thermal pressure or other processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 16:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The DP model needs a free parameter, acting as\na cut-off to regularize the dynamics, and the predictions of the model highly\ndepend on the value of this cut-off. The Compton wavelength of a nucleon seems\nto be the most reasonable cut-off value since it justifies the non-relativistic\napproach. However, with this value, the DP model predicts an unrealistic high\nrate of energy increase. Thus, one either is forced to choose a much larger\ncut-off, which is not physically justified and totally arbitrary, or one needs\nto include dissipative effects in order to tame the energy increase. Taking the\nanalogy with dissipative collisional decoherence seriously, we develop a\ndissipative generalization of the DP model. We show that even with dissipative\neffects, the DP model contradicts known physical facts, unless either the\ncut-off is kept artificially large, or one limits the applicability of the\nmodel to massive systems.

However, observational evidence\nof eruptive, filament-hosting MFR systems has been elusive for those\noriginating in active regions. By utilizing multi-passband extreme-ultra-violet\n(EUV) observations from SDO/AIA, we present direct evidence of an eruptive MFR\nin the low corona that exhibits a hot envelope and a cooler core; the latter is\nlikely the upper part of a filament that undergoes a partial eruption, which is\nlater observed in the upper corona as the coiled kernel of a fast, WL CME.

The timing of the MFR kinematics\nis found to be well correlated with the energy release of the associated\nlong-duration C1.9 flare.

In such solutions, the\ntemporal period, and possibly other additional internal parameters such as the\npropagation constant, are unknown priori and need to be determined along with\nthe solution itself. The main idea of the method is to first express those\nunknown parameters in terms of the solution through quasi-Rayleigh quotients,\nso that the resulting integro-differential equation is for the time-periodic\nsolution only. Then this equation is computed in the combined spatiotemporal\ndomain as a boundary value problem by Newton-conjugate-gradient iterations. The\nproposed method applies to both stable and unstable time-periodic solutions;\nits numerical accuracy is spectral; it is fast-converging; and its coding is\nshort and simple. As numerical examples, this method is applied to the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the cubic-quintic Ginzburg-Landau equation,\nwhose time-periodic or relative time-periodic solutions with spatially-periodic\nor spatially-localized profiles are computed. This method also applies to\nsystems of ordinary differential equations, as is illustrated by its simple\ncomputation of periodic orbits in the Lorenz equations. MATLAB codes for all\nnumerical examples are provided in appendices to illustrate the simple\nimplementation of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 18:39:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-28"}

The physical objective as a functional of the field\nforms the quantum control landscape, whose topology, under certain conditions,\nhas been shown to contain no critical point suboptimal traps, thereby enabling\neffective searches for fields that give the global maximum of the objective.\nThis paper addresses the structure of the landscape as a complement to\ntopological critical point features. Recent work showed that landscape\nstructure is highly favorable for optimization of state-to-state transition\nprobabilities, in that gradient-based control trajectories to the global\nmaximum value are nearly straight paths. The landscape structure is codified in\nthe metric $R\\geq 1.0$, defined as the ratio of the length of the control\ntrajectory to the Euclidean distance between the initial and optimal controls.\nA value of $R=1$ would indicate an exactly straight trajectory to the optimal\nobservable value. This paper extends the state-to-state transition probability\nresults to the quantum ensemble and unitary transformation control landscapes.\nAgain, nearly straight trajectories predominate, and we demonstrate that $R$\ncan take values approaching 1.0 with high precision. However, the interplay of\noptimization trajectories with critical saddle submanifolds is found to\ninfluence landscape structure. A fundamental relationship necessary for\nperfectly straight gradient-based control trajectories is derived wherein the\ngradient on the quantum control landscape must be an eigenfunction of the\nHessian.

Theorem 4 of Liao (2009) gives a\nbroad generalization of this fact to a setting where there is a diffusion on a\nmanifold $X$ with a distribution that is equivariant under the smooth action of\na Lie group $K$. Under appropriate conditions, there is a decomposition into an\nautonomously Markovian \"radial\" part that lives on the space of orbits of $K$\nand an \"angular\" part that is an independent Brownian motion on the homogeneous\nspace $K/M$, where $M$ is the isotropy subgroup of a point of $x$, that is\ntime-changed with a time-change that is adapted to the filtration of the radial\npart.

Unlike traditional electroweakino searches,\nwhich perform best when $m_{\\widetilde{\\chi}^0_{2,3}} -\nm_{\\widetilde{\\chi}^0_1}, m_{\\widetilde{\\chi}^{\\pm}} - m_{\\widetilde{\\chi}^0_1}\n> m_Z$, our search favors nearly degenerate spectra; degenerate electroweakinos\ntypically have a larger branching ratio to photons, and the cut $m_{\\ell\\ell}\n\\ll m_Z$ effectively removes on-shell Z boson backgrounds while retaining the\nsignal. This feature makes our technique optimal for `well-tempered' scenarios,\nwhere the dark matter relic abundance is achieved with inter-electroweakino\nsplittings of $\\sim 20 - 70\\,\\text{GeV}$. Additionally, our strategy applies to\na wider range of scenarios where the lightest neutralinos are almost\ndegenerate, but only make up a subdominant component of the dark matter -- a\nspectrum we dub `well-forged'.

Computations including the exact\ntop-quark mass dependence are only available at the leading order, and\ncurrently predictions at higher orders are obtained by means of approximations\nbased on the Higgs-gluon effective field theory (HEFT). In this work we present\na reweighting technique that, starting from events obtained via the MC@NLO\nmethod in the HEFT, allows to exactly include the top-quark mass and width\neffects coming from one- and two-loop amplitudes.

However, the\nhigh degree of symmetry of simple accretion disc models can be difficult to\ncapture accurately by these methods, due to the generation of geometric grid\nnoise and associated numerical diffusion, which is absent in polar grids. To\nexplore these and other issues, in this work we study the idealized problem of\ntwo-dimensional planet-disc interaction with the moving-mesh code AREPO. We\nexplore the hydrodynamic evolution of discs with planets through a series of\nnumerical experiments that vary the planet mass, the disc viscosity and the\nmesh resolution, and compare the resulting surface density, vortensity field\nand tidal torque with results from the literature. We find that the performance\nof the moving-mesh code in this problem is in accordance with published\nresults, showing good consistency with grid codes written in polar coordinates.\nWe also conclude that grid noise and mesh distortions do not introduce\nexcessive numerical diffusion. Finally, we show how the moving-mesh approach\ncan naturally increase resolution in regions of high densityaround planets and\nplanetary wakes, while retaining the background flow at low resolution.

The\nOTE pair amplitudes are absent in the bulk region, but ubiquitously exist in\nthe surface and interface region as Andreev bound states. We here clarify that\nadditional discrete symmetries, originating from the internal symmetry and\npoint group symmetry, impose strong constraint on the OTE pair amplitudes\nemergent in the surface of TRI superfluids and superconductors. As a result of\nthe symmetry constraint, the magnetic response of the OTE pairs yields\nIsing-like anisotropy. For the topological phase of the $^3$He-B in a\nrestricted geometry, the coupling of the OTE pair amplitudes to an applied\nfield is prohibited by an additional discrete symmetry. Once the discrete\nsymmetry is broken, however, the OTE pairs start to couple to the applied\nfield, which anomalously enhances surface spin susceptibility. Furthermore, we\nextend this theory to TRI superconductors, where the corresponding discrete\nsymmetry is the mirror reflection symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 09:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-27"}

On the other hand, the wave of July 6th may be\nassociated to X1.1 class flare that occurred at 23.01 UT around the 11515\nactive region. From the kinematical analysis, the wave propagated with the\ninitial velocity of about $994\\pm70$ km/s which is in agreement with coronal\nshock velocity derived from type II radio burst observation, $v\\sim1100$ km/s.\nThese two identified waves add the inventory of the large-scale waves observed\nin 24th Solar Cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 10:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-29"}

For sequences sampled at a single time, we found the\ncoalescent and the birth-death-sampling model gave virtually indistinguishable\nresults in terms of the growth rates and fraction of the population sampled,\neven when sampling from a small population. For sequences sampled at multiple\ntime points, we find that the birth-death model estimators are subject to large\nbias if the sampling process is misspecified. Since birth-death-sampling models\nincorporate a model of the sampling process, we show how much of the\nstatistical power of birth-death-sampling models arises from the sequence of\nsample times and not from the genealogical tree. This motivates the development\nof a new coalescent estimator, which is augmented with a model of the known\nsampling process and is potentially more precise than the coalescent that does\nnot use sample time information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 12:13:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-29"}

The\nattribution of about 80 transitions of up to fifth order Raman processes are\nproposed in the low temperature(95K)resonant Raman spectrum measured with the\nexcitation energy of 1.96 eV,which is slightly shifted from the A exciton.

We present the data collection and reduction\nfor the Spitzer and ancillary data, and define the \"standard sample\" on which\nwe calculate statistics, consisting of fast cadence data, with epochs about\ntwice per day for ~40d. We also define a \"standard sample of members\",\nconsisting of all the IR-selected members and X-ray selected members. We\ncharacterize the standard sample in terms of other properties, such as spectral\nenergy distribution shape. We use three mechanisms to identify variables in the\nfast cadence data--the Stetson index, a chi^2 fit to a flat light curve, and\nsignificant periodicity. We also identified variables on the longest timescales\npossible of ~6 years, by comparing measurements taken early in the Spitzer\nmission with the mean from our YSOVAR campaign. The fraction of members in each\ncluster that are variable on these longest timescales is a function of the\nratio of Class I/total members in each cluster, such that clusters with a\nhigher fraction of Class I objects also have a higher fraction of long-term\nvariables. For objects with a YSOVAR-determined period and a [3.6]-[8] color,\nwe find that a star with a longer period is more likely than those with shorter\nperiods to have an IR excess. We do not find any evidence for variability that\ncauses [3.6]-[4.5] excesses to appear or vanish within our data; out of members\nand field objects combined, at most 0.02% may have transient IR excesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 15:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The functional\nminimization gives access to the solvation free energy and to the equilibrium\nsolvent density. Some correction to the functional are also proposed to get the\nproper tetrahedral order of solvent molecules around a charged solute and to\nreproduce the correct long range hydrophobic behavior of big apolar solutes.
