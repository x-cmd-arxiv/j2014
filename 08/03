While imaging has been used extensively for Solar\nSystem bodies and extended objects like galaxies, the small angular extent of\ntypical planetary systems makes it difficult or impossible to resolve them.\nSpatially integrated observations like measuring the total brightness or\nspectrum, however, can be conducted at a resonable cost. This thesis focuses on\nphotometric models in the context of transiting systems, which exhibit a number\nof phenomena that can be exploited for characterization.\n  First, we showcase the popular methods of transiting exoplanet discovery and\ncharacterization by ground based observations on the hot Jupiter HAT-P-27b. We\ndemonstrate how transits allow us to constrain planetary mass, radius, and\norbital inclination, which would not be possible based only on, for example,\nradial velocity measurements.\n  Next, we perform reflection spectroscopy on HAT-P-1b, another hot Jupiter,\nusing the binary companion of the host star as a reference to remove systematic\nerrors from the signal. Here the transiting nature of the system allows us to\nlook for the very faint light reflected by the planet.\n  We also apply the idea of planetary transits to investigate the feasibility\nof transit observations in astrophysical systems of very different scale: stars\nin galactic nuclei potentially transiting the accretion disk of the\nsupermassive black hole in the galactic center.\n  Finally, we focus on mapping spots on the stellar surface using transits.\nThis method has been used for a decade, and helped constrain stellar rotation\nor orbital geometry in a number systems. We study starspots on HAT-P-11 to\nlearn more about stellar rotation and to investigate the size and contrast of\nthe spots themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 2014 17:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-05"}

Our first\nresult is an FT-spanner with additive stretch $2$ and $\\widetilde{O}(n^{5/3})$\nedges. Our second result is an FT-spanner with additive stretch $6$ and\n$\\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ edges. The construction algorithm consists of two main\ncomponents: (a) constructing an FT-clustering graph and (b) applying a modified\npath-buying procedure suitably adopted to failure prone settings. Finally, we\nalso describe two constructions for {\\em fault-tolerant multi-source additive\nspanners}, aiming to guarantee a bounded additive stretch following a vertex\nfailure, for every pair of vertices in $S \\times V$ for a given subset of\nsources $S\\subseteq V$. The additive stretch bounds of our constructions are 4\nand 8 (using a different number of edges).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Aug 2014 19:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-05"}

The simulations are 3D\nextending horizontally 1 x 1 kpc squared and vertically 2 kpc, symmetric about\nthe galactic mid-plane. They routinely span gas number densities 1/10000 to 100\nper cubic cm, temperatures 100 to 100 MK, speeds up to 10000 km/s and Mach\nnumber up to 25. Radiative cooling is applied from two widely adopted\nparameterizations, and compared directly to assess the sensitivity of the\nresults to cooling. There is strong evidence to describe the ISM as comprising\nwell defined cold, warm and hot regions, which are statistically close to\nthermal and total pressure equilibrium. This result is not sensitive to the\nchoice of parameters considered here. The distribution of the gas density\nwithin each can be robustly modelled as lognormal. Appropriate distinction is\nrequired between the properties of the gases in the supernova active mid-plane\nand the more homogeneous phases outside this region. The connection between the\nfractional volume of a phase and its various proxies is clarified. An exact\nrelation is then derived between the fractional volume and the filling factors\ndefined in terms of the volume and probabilistic averages. These results are\ndiscussed in both observational and computational contexts. The correlation\nscale of the random flows is calculated from the velocity autocorrelation\nfunction; it is of order 100 pc and tends to grow with distance from the\nmid-plane. The origin and structure of the magnetic fields in the ISM is also\ninvestigated in non-ideal MHD simulations. A seed magnetic field, with volume\naverage of roughly 4 nG, grows exponentially to reach a statistically steady\nstate within 1.6 Gyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Aug 2014 01:17:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Aug 2014 21:41:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 00:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-15"}

Recent studies in Naked Mole Rat (NMR) and long- lived sea\nurchin showed that the level of gene expression changes with age is lower than\nin other organisms. These phenotypic observations correlate well with\nexceptional endurance of NMR tissues to various genotoxic stresses. Therefore,\nthe lifelong transcriptional stability of an organism may be a key determinant\nof longevity. However, the exact relation between genetic network stability,\nstress-resistance and aging has not been defined. We analyze the stability of a\nsimple genetic- network model of a living organism under the influence of\nexternal and endogenous factors. We demonstrate that under most common\ncircumstances a gene network is inherently unstable and suffers from\nexponential accumulation of gene-regulation deviations leading to death.\nHowever, should the repair systems be sufficiently effective, the gene network\ncan stabilize so that gene damage remains constrained along with mortality of\nthe organism, which may then enjoy a remarkable degree of stability over very\nlong times. We clarify the relation between stress-resistance and aging and\nsuggest that stabilization of the genetic network may provide a mathematical\nexplanation of the Gompertz equation describing the relationship between age\nand mortality in many species, and of the apparently negligible senescence\nobserved in exceptionally long-lived animals. The model may support a range of\napplications, such as systematic searches for therapeutics to extend lifespan\nand healthspan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Aug 2014 07:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-15"}

While the large scale nature of the\nproblem entails to find distributed solutions, game theory appears to be a\nnatural tool. We propose a novel distributed algorithm based on group formation\ngames, called \\textit{the hedonic decision algorithm}. This formalism is\nconstructive: a new class of group formation games is introduced where the\nutility of players within a group is separable and symmetric being a\ngeneralized version of parity-affiliation games. The proposed hedonic decision\nalgorithm is also suitable for any set-covering problem. To evaluate the\nperformance of our algorithm, we propose other approaches to which our\nalgorithm is compared. We first develop a centralized recursive algorithm\ncalled \\textit{the hold minimum} being able to find the optimal assignments.\nHowever, because of the NP-hard complexity of the mobile assignment problem, we\npropose a centralized polynomial-time heuristic algorithm called \\textit{the\ncolumn control} producing near-optimal solutions when the operational power\ncosts of base stations are taken into account. Starting from this efficient\ncentralized approach, a \\textit{distributed column control algorithm} is also\nproposed and compared to \\textit{the hedonic decision algorithm}. We also\nimplement the nearest base station algorithm which is very simple and intuitive\nand efficiently manage fast-moving users served by macro BSs. Extensive\nsimulation results are provided and highlight the relative performance of these\nalgorithms. The simulated scenarios are done according to Poisson point\nprocesses for both mobiles and base stations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Aug 2014 10:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-05"}

In this paper, we study the\nvalue of help bits in the settings of randomized and average-case complexity.\n  Amir, Beigel, and Gasarch (1990) show that for constant $k$, if $k$ instances\nof a decision problem can be efficiently solved using less than $k$ bits of\nhelp, then the problem is in P/poly. We extend this result to the setting of\nrandomized computation: We show that the decision problem is in P/poly if using\n$\\ell$ help bits, $k$ instances of the problem can be efficiently solved with\nprobability greater than $2^{\\ell-k}$. The same result holds if using less than\n$k(1 - h(\\alpha))$ help bits (where $h(\\cdot)$ is the binary entropy function),\nwe can efficiently solve $(1-\\alpha)$ fraction of the instances correctly with\nnon-vanishing probability. We also extend these two results to non-constant but\nlogarithmic $k$. In this case however, instead of showing that the problem is\nin P/poly we show that it satisfies \"$k$-membership comparability,\" a notion\nknown to be related to solving $k$ instances using less than $k$ bits of help.\n  Next we consider the setting of average-case complexity: Assume that we can\nsolve $k$ instances of a decision problem using some help bits whose entropy is\nless than $k$ when the $k$ instances are drawn independently from a particular\ndistribution. Then we can efficiently solve an instance drawn from that\ndistribution with probability better than $1/2$.\n  Finally, we show that in the case where $k$ is super-logarithmic, assuming\n$k$-membership comparability of a decision problem, one cannot prove that the\nproblem is in P/poly by a \"black-box proof.\"\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Aug 2014 13:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-12"}

Traditionally, analyzing large graphs\nrequires a cluster of machines so the aggregate memory exceeds the graph size.\nWe demonstrate that a multicore server can process graphs with billions of\nvertices and hundreds of billions of edges, utilizing commodity SSDs with\nminimal performance loss. We do so by implementing a graph-processing engine on\ntop of a user-space SSD file system designed for high IOPS and extreme\nparallelism. Our semi-external memory graph engine called FlashGraph stores\nvertex state in memory and edge lists on SSDs. It hides latency by overlapping\ncomputation with I/O. To save I/O bandwidth, FlashGraph only accesses edge\nlists requested by applications from SSDs; to increase I/O throughput and\nreduce CPU overhead for I/O, it conservatively merges I/O requests. These\ndesigns maximize performance for applications with different I/O\ncharacteristics. FlashGraph exposes a general and flexible vertex-centric\nprogramming interface that can express a wide variety of graph algorithms and\ntheir optimizations. We demonstrate that FlashGraph in semi-external memory\nperforms many algorithms with performance up to 80% of its in-memory\nimplementation and significantly outperforms PowerGraph, a popular distributed\nin-memory graph engine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Aug 2014 13:44:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jan 2015 06:49:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 01:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-27"}
