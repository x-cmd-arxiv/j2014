Since\nthe 1950s, scientists have developed ever-diversifying families of black box\noptimisation algorithms designed to address any optimisation problem, requiring\nonly that quality of a candidate solution is calculated via a fitness function\nspecific to the problem. For such algorithms to be successful, at least three\nproperties are required: an effective informed sampling strategy, that guides\ngeneration of new candidates on the basis of fitnesses and locations of\npreviously visited candidates; mechanisms to ensure efficiency, so that same\ncandidates are not repeatedly visited; absence of structural bias, which, if\npresent, would predispose the algorithm towards limiting its search to some\nregions of solution space. The first two of these properties have been\nextensively investigated, however the third is little understood. In this\narticle we provide theoretical and empirical analyses that contribute to the\nunderstanding of structural bias. We prove a theorem concerning dynamics of\npopulation variance in the case of real-valued search spaces. This reveals how\nstructural bias can manifest as non-uniform clustering of population over time.\nTheory predicts that structural bias is exacerbated with increasing population\nsize and problem difficulty. These predictions reveal two previously\nunrecognised aspects of structural bias. Respectively, increasing population\nsize, though ostensibly promoting diversity, will magnify any inherent\nstructural bias, and effects of structural bias are more apparent when faced\nwith difficult problems. Our theoretical result also suggests that two commonly\nused approaches to enhancing exploration, increasing population size and\nincreasing disruptiveness of search operators, have quite distinct implications\nin terms of structural bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 16:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

To address this issue, one popular\napproach is convex relaxation. However, such an approach may produce suboptimal\nestimators due to the relaxation effect. To optimally estimate sparse principal\nsubspaces, we propose a two-stage computational framework named \"tighten after\nrelax\": Within the 'relax' stage, we approximately solve a convex relaxation of\nsparse PCA with early stopping to obtain a desired initial estimator; For the\n'tighten' stage, we propose a novel algorithm called sparse orthogonal\niteration pursuit (SOAP), which iteratively refines the initial estimator by\ndirectly solving the underlying nonconvex problem. A key concept of this\ntwo-stage framework is the basin of attraction. It represents a local region\nwithin which the `tighten' stage has desired computational and statistical\nguarantees. We prove that, the initial estimator obtained from the 'relax'\nstage falls into such a region, and hence SOAP geometrically converges to a\nprincipal subspace estimator which is minimax-optimal within a certain model\nclass. Unlike most existing sparse PCA estimators, our approach applies to the\nnon-spiked covariance models, and adapts to non-Gaussianity as well as\ndependent data settings. Moreover, through analyzing the computational\ncomplexity of the two stages, we illustrate an interesting phenomenon that\nlarger sample size can reduce the total iteration complexity. Our framework\nmotivates a general paradigm for solving many complex statistical problems\nwhich involve nonconvex optimization with provable guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 16:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-25"}

Cyclotron radiation, the particular form of\nradiation emitted by an electron orbiting in a magnetic field, was first\nderived in 1904. Despite the simplicity of this concept, and the enormous\nutility of electron spectroscopy in nuclear and particle physics,\nsingle-electron cyclotron radiation has never been observed directly. Here we\ndemonstrate single-electron detection in a novel radiofrequency spec- trometer.\nWe observe the cyclotron radiation emitted by individual magnetically-trapped\nelectrons that are produced with mildly-relativistic energies by a gaseous\nradioactive source. The relativistic shift in the cyclotron frequency permits a\nprecise electron energy measurement. Precise beta elec- tron spectroscopy from\ngaseous radiation sources is a key technique in modern efforts to measure the\nneutrino mass via the tritium decay endpoint, and this work demonstrates a\nfundamentally new approach to precision beta spectroscopy for future neutrino\nmass experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 17:00:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 May 2015 13:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-04"}

We introduce a self-consistent scheme to\nevaluate the propagators of the collective modes at the leading order in 1/N.\nThe contributions from the vacuum and from the magnetic field are separated\nsuch that we can employ the well-established regularization scheme for the case\nof vanishing magnetic field. The same scheme can be applied to the study of the\nnext-to-leading order correction in 1/N. We show that the sigma mode is always\na lightly bound state with its mass being twice the dynamical fermion mass for\narbitrary strength of the magnetic field. Since the dynamics of the collective\nmodes is always 2+1 dimensional, the finite temperature transition should be of\nthe Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) type. We determine the KT transition temperature\n$T_{\\rm KT}$ as well as the mass melting temperature $T^*$ as a function of the\nmagnetic field.

However, current methodologies cannot easily evaluate both the\nspatial and temporal changes in brain networks with cognitive state. Here we\ncombine a simple data reorganization with spatial ICA, enabling a\nspatiotemporal ICA (stICA) which captures the consistent evolution of networks\nduring onset and offset of a task. The technique was applied to FMRI datasets\ninvolving alternating between rest and task and to simple synthetic data.\nStarting and finishing time-points of periods of interest (anchors) were\ndefined at task block onsets and offsets. For each subject, the ten volumes\nfollowing each anchor were extracted and concatenated spatially, producing a\nsingle 3D sample. Samples for all anchors and subjects were concatenated along\nthe fourth dimension. This 4D dataset was decomposed using ICA into\nspatiotemporal components. One component exhibited the transition with task\nonset from a default mode network (DMN) becoming less active to a\nfronto-parietal control network (FPCN) becoming more active. We observed other\nchanges with relevance to understanding network dynamics, e.g., the DMN showed\na changing spatial distribution, shifting to an anterior/superior pattern of\ndeactivation during task from a posterior/inferior pattern during rest. By\nanchoring analyses to periods associated with the onsets and offsets of task,\nour approach reveals novel aspects of the dynamics of network activity\naccompanying these transitions.

We start with relatively dense GRNs and then use\ndifferential evolution (DE) to evolve interaction coefficients. When the target\ndynamical behavior is found embedded in a dense GRN, we narrow the focus of the\nsearch and begin aggressively pruning out excess interactions at the end of\neach generation. We first show that the method can quickly rediscover known\nsmall GRNs for a toggle switch and an oscillatory circuit. Next we include\nthese GRNs as non-evolvable subnetworks in the subsequent evolution of more\ncomplex, modular GRNs. Successful solutions found in canonical DE where we\ntruncated small interactions to zero, with or without an interaction penalty\nterm, invariably contained many excess interactions. In contrast, by\nincorporating aggressive pruning and the penalty term, the DE was able to find\nminimal or nearly minimal GRNs in all test problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 18:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

We also show that the SDSS data provide a strong\nconstraint on the shape of the dark matter halo potential. Within\ngalactocentric distances of 20 kpc, the dark matter halo potential is well\ndescribed as an oblate halo with axis ratio qDM=0.7+/-0.1; this corresponds to\nan axis ratio qDM=0.4+/-0.1 for the dark matter density distribution.

Using the radiative transfer\ncode CMFGEN, we investigate the recently-reported 15.5 h post-explosion\nspectrum of the type IIb SN 2013cu. For the first time, we are able to directly\nmeasure the chemical abundances of a SN progenitor and find a relatively H-rich\nwind, with H and He abundances (by mass) of X=0.46 +- 0.2 and Y=0.52 +- 0.2,\nrespectively. The wind is enhanced in N and depleted in C relative to solar\nvalues (mass fractions of 8.2e-3 and 1e-5). We obtain that a dense\nwind/circumstellar medium, with a mass-loss rate of Mdot= 3e-3 Msun/yr and wind\nvelocity vwind=100 km/s, surrounds the star at the pre-SN stage. These values\nare lower than previous analytical estimates, although we find Mdot/vinf\nconsistent with previous work. We also compute a CMFGEN model to constrain the\nprogenitor spectral type and find that the high Mdot and low vwind imply that\nthe star had an effective temperature of ~8000 K immediately before the SN\nexplosion. Our models suggest that the progenitor was either an unstable\nluminous blue variable or a yellow hypergiant undergoing an eruptive phase, and\nrule out a WR star. We classify the post-explosion spectra at 15.5 h as XWN5(h)\nand advocate for the use of the prefix `X' (eXplosion) to avoid confusion\nbetween post-explosion, non-stellar spectra with those of massive stars. We\nshow that the progenitor spectral type is significantly different than the\nearly post-explosion spectral type owing to the huge differences in the\nionization structure before and after the SN event. We find the following\ntemporal evolution: LBV/YHG -> XWN5(h) -> SN IIb. Future early-time\nspectroscopy in the UV will give access to additional spectroscopic diagnostics\nand further constrain the properties of SN precursors, such as their\nmetallicities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 19:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

Here, we consider the two-community case in a special limit: a\nsystem of extreme introverts and extroverts - the XIE model. Surprising\nphenomena appear, even in this minimal model, where the only control parameters\nare the numbers of each subgroup: $N_{I,E}$. Specifically, an extraordinary\ntransition emerges when $N_I$ crosses $N_E$. For example, the fraction of total\nnumber of I-E links jumps from $\\thicksim 0$ to $\\thicksim 1$. In a $N_I=N_E$\nsystem, this fraction performs a pure random walk so that its distribution\ndisplays a flat plateau across most of $[0,1]$, with the edges vanishing as\n$(N_{I,E})^{-0.38}$ for large systems. Thus, we believe the XIE model exhibits\nan extreme Thouless effect. For this limiting model, we show that detailed\nbalance is restored and explicitly find the microscopic steady-state\ndistribution.

The motion of an animal pair is taken to obey\na Smoluchowski equation in 2n-dimensional space that combines diffusion with\nconfinement of each animal to its particular home range. An additional\n(reaction) term that comes into play when the animals are in close proximity\ndescribes the process of infection. Analytic solutions are obtained, confirmed\nby numerical procedures, and shown to predict a surprising effect of\nconfinement. The effect is that infection spread has a non-monotonic dependence\non the diffusion constant and/or the extent of the attachment of the animals to\nthe home ranges. Optimum values of these parameters exist for any given\ndistance between the attractive centers. Any change from those values,\ninvolving faster/slower diffusion or shallower/steeper confinement, hinders the\ntransmission of infection. A physical explanation is provided by the theory.\nReduction to the simpler case of no home ranges is demonstrated.

The\ntype of the instability usually prescribes the resulting spatio-temporal\npatterns and their characteristic length scales. However, patterns resulting\nfrom the simultaneous occurrence of instabilities cannot be expected to be\nsimple superposition of the patterns associated with the considered\ninstabilities. To address this issue we design two simple models composed by\ntwo asymmetrically coupled equations of non-conserved (Swift-Hohenberg\nequations) or conserved (Cahn-Hilliard equations) order parameters with\ndifferent characteristic wave lengths. The patterns arising in these systems\nrange from coexisting static patterns of different wavelengths to traveling\nwaves. A linear stability analysis allows to derive a two parameter phase\ndiagram for the studied models, in particular revealing for the Swift-Hohenberg\nequations a co-dimension two bifurcation point of Turing and wave instability\nand a region of coexistence of stationary and traveling patterns. The nonlinear\ndynamics of the coupled evolution equations is investigated by performing\naccurate numerical simulations. These reveal more complex patterns, ranging\nfrom traveling waves with embedded Turing patterns domains to spatio-temporal\nchaos, and a wide hysteretic region, where waves or Turing patterns coexist.\nFor the coupled Cahn-Hilliard equations the presence of an weak coupling is\nsufficient to arrest the coarsening process and to lead to the emergence of\npurely periodic patterns. The final states are characterized by domains with a\ncharacteristic length, which diverges logarithmically with the coupling\namplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 21:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

Quantifying the effects of 'linked selection' on levels of genetic\ndiversity is key to making reliable inference about demography, building a null\nmodel in scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics of\nnatural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that jointly infers\nparameters of distinct modes of linked selection, notably background selection\nand selective sweeps, from genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations\nand genetic maps. The central idea is to calculate the probability that a\nneutral site is polymorphic given local annotations, substitution patterns, and\nrecombination rates. Information is then combined across sites and samples\nusing composite likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of\ndistinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter estimation, this approach\nyields a map of the expected neutral diversity levels along the genome. To\nillustrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing\ndata from 125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict diversity\nlevels at the 1Mb scale. Our results corroborate estimates of a high fraction\nof beneficial substitutions in proteins and untranslated regions (UTR). They\nallow us to distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes of\nselection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover evidence for pervasive\nsweeps in untranslated regions (UTRs).

The EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on board Hinode\nprovides a unique means to deduce outflow velocities at coronal heights via\ndirect Doppler shift measurements of coronal emission lines. Such direct\nDoppler shift measurements were not possible with previous spectrometers. We\nmeasure the outflow velocity at coronal heights in several on-disk\nlong-duration plumes, which are located in coronal holes and show significant\nblue shifts throughout the entire observational period. In one case, a plume is\nmeasured 4 hours apart. The deduced outflow velocities are consistent,\nsuggesting that the flows are quasi-steady. Furthermore, we provide an outflow\nvelocity profile along the plumes, finding that the velocity corrected for the\nline-of-sight effect can reach 10 km s$^{-1}$ at 1.02 $R_{\\odot}$, 15 km\ns$^{-1}$ at 1.03 $R_{\\odot}$, and 25 km s$^{-1}$ at 1.05 $R_{\\odot}$.

This three filter narrow band system measures the flux\ndistribution in the region from 4900 to 5600A in order to find any\npeculiarities around 5200A. It is highly efficient to detect classical\nchemically peculiar stars of the upper main sequence, Be/Ae, shell and\nmetal-weak objects in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. We present Delta a\nphotometry of 2266 stars from 109 individual frames for three globular Clusters\n(NGC 104, NGC 6205, and NGC 7099). A comparison with published abundances, for\nthree horizontal-branch stars, only, yield an excellent agreement. According to\nthe 3 sigma detection limit of each globular cluster, about 3% of the stars lie\nin abnormal regions in the diagnostic diagrams. The first observations of three\nwidely different aggregates give very promising results, which will serve as a\nsolid basis for follow-up observations including photometric as well as\nspectroscopic studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Aug 2014 11:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

As a starting study, we refrain from\ninsisting on an action principle and focus exclusively on the equations of\nmotion. The present work, despite the absence of an explicit action functional,\ncan be regarded to extend Milgrom's modified inertia approach to relativistic\ndomain. Our results show that a proper MOND limit arises if energy-momentum\ntensor is modified to involve determinant of the metric tensor in reference to\nthe flat metric, where the latter is dynamically generated as in gravitational\nHiggs mechanism. This modified energy-momentum tensor is conserved in both\nNewtonian and MONDian regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 18:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-17"}

With this powerful means of\ninvestigation, he first studies the phenomena of the arc then used for the\ncoastal and urban lighting and then, the singing arc used as a transmitter of\nradio waves in wireless telegraphy. In 1905, he highlights a new type of\nnon-sinusoidal oscillations in the singing arc. Twenty years later, Balthasar\nvan der Pol will recognize that such oscillations were in fact \"relaxation\noscillations\". To explain this phenomenon, he uses a representation in the\nphase plane and shows that its evolution takes the form of small cycles. During\nWorld War I the triode gradually replaces the singing arc in transmission\nsystems. At the end of the war, using analogy, Blondel transposes to the triode\nmost of the results he had obtained for the singing arc. In April 1919, he\npublishes a long memoir in which he introduces the terminology \"self-sustained\noscillations\" and proposes to illustrate this concept starting from the example\nof the Tantalus cup which is then picked up by Van der Pol and Philippe Le\nCorbeiller. He then provides the definition of a self sustained system which is\nquite similar to that given later by Aleksandr Andronov and Van der Pol. To\nstudy the stability of oscillations sustained by the triode and by the singing\narc he uses, this time, a representation in the complex plane and he expresses\nthe amplitude in polar coordinates. He then justifies the maintaining of\noscillations by the existence cycles which nearly present all the features of\nPoincar\\'e's limit cycles. Finally, in November 1919, Blondel performs, a year\nbefore Van der Pol, the setting in equation of the triode oscillations. In\nMarch 1926, Blondel establishes the differential equation characterizing the\noscillations of the singing arc, completely similar to that obtained\nconcomitantly by Van der Pol for the triode. Thus, throughout his career,\nBlondel, has made fundamental and relatively unknown contributions to the\ndevelopment of the theory of nonlinear oscillations. The purpose of this\narticle is to analyze his main work in this area and to measure their\nimportance or influence by placing them in the perspective of the development\nof this theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Aug 2014 07:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 19:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-15"}
