The guiding principle of the tensor approach is the rank-structured\nseparable approximation of multivariate functions and operators represented on\na grid. Recently, the traditional Tucker, canonical, and matrix product states\n(tensor train) tensor models have been applied to the grid-based electronic\nstructure calculations, to parametric PDEs, and to dynamical equations arising\nin scientific computing. The essential progress is based on the quantics tensor\napproximation method proved to be capable to represent (approximate) function\nrelated $d$-dimensional data arrays of size $N^d$ with log-volume complexity,\n$O(d \\log N)$. Combined with the traditional numerical schemes, these novel\ntools establish a new promising approach for solving multidimensional integral\nand differential equations using low-parametric rank-structured tensor formats.\nAs the main example, we describe the grid-based tensor numerical approach for\nsolving the 3D nonlinear Hartree-Fock eigenvalue problem, that was the starting\npoint for the developments of tensor-structured numerical methods for\nlarge-scale computations in solving real-life multidimensional problems. We\nalso address new results on tensor approximation of the dynamical Fokker-Planck\nand master equations in many dimensions up to $d=20$. Numerical tests\ndemonstrate the benefits of the rank-structured tensor approximation on the\naforementioned examples of multidimensional PDEs. In particular, the use of\ngrid-based tensor representations in the reduced basis of atomics orbitals\nyields an accurate solution of the Hartree-Fock equation on large $N\\times N\n\\times N$ grids with a grid size of up to $N= 10^{5}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 16:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-19"}

We perform automated bulge-disc decompositions for 163 nearby\ngalaxies, by simultaneously fitting multiple images taken in five photometric\nfilters. We show that we are able to recover structural measurements that agree\nwell with various other works, and confirm a number of key results. We\nadditionally use our results to illustrate the link between total S\\'ersic\nindex and bulge-disc structure, and demonstrate that the visually\nclassification of lenticular galaxies is strongly dependent on the inclination\nof their disc component.\n  By simulating the same set of galaxies as they would appear if observed at a\nrange of redshifts, we are able to study the behaviour of bulge-disc\ndecompositions as data quality diminishes. We examine how our multi-band fits\nperform, and compare to the results of more conventional, single-band methods.\nMulti-band fitting improves the measurement of all parameters, but particularly\nthe bulge-to total flux ratio and component colours. We therefore encourage the\nuse of this approach with future surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 17:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In this paper, using analytic arguments and numerical\nsimulations, we study the behaviour of local observables in an isolated MBL\nsystem following a quantum quench. For the case of a global quench, we find\nthat the local observables reach stationary, highly non-thermal values at long\ntimes as a result of slow dephasing characteristic of the MBL phase. These\nstationary values retain the local memory of the initial state due to the\nexistence of local integrals of motion in the MBL phase. The temporal\nfluctuations around stationary values exhibit universal power-law decay in\ntime, with an exponent set by the localization length and the diagonal entropy\nof the initial state. Such a power-law decay holds for any local observable and\nis related to the logarithmic in time growth of entanglement in the MBL phase.\nThis behaviour distinguishes the MBL phase from both the Anderson insulator\n(where no stationary state is reached), and from the ergodic phase (where\nrelaxation is expected to be exponential). For the case of a local quench, we\nalso find a power-law approach of local observables to their stationary values\nwhen the system is prepared in a mixed state. Quench protocols considered in\nthis paper can be naturally implemented in systems of ultra cold atoms in\ndisordered optical lattices, and the behaviour of local observables provides a\ndirect experimental signature of many-body localization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 19:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

The ratio of warm to cool\ntemperatures is constant in the range 2-4, and the temperatures of both warm\nand cool components increases with stellar mass.

Furthermore, we\nshow that the gravitational pull of the LMC and response of the Milky Way are\nlikely to significantly affect the orbit and phase space distribution of tidal\ndebris from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). Such effects are larger than\nprevious estimates based on the torque of the LMC alone. As a result, Sgr\ndeposits debris in regions of the sky that are not aligned with the present-day\nSgr orbital plane. In addition, we find that properly accounting for the\nmovement of the Milky Way around its common center of mass with the LMC\nsignificantly modifies the angular distance between apocenters and tilts its\norbital pole, alleviating tensions between previous models and observations.\nWhile these models are preliminary in nature, they highlight the central\nimportance of accounting for the mutual gravitational interaction between the\nMW and LMC when modeling the kinematics of objects in the Milky Way and Local\nGroup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 20:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 20:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

This symmetry gives rise to a\nfirst integral of the Euler equation, often employed for constructing\nequilibrium solutions via iteration. For eccentric orbits, however, the lack of\nhelical symmetry has prevented the use of this method, and the numerical\nrelativity community has often resorted to constructing initial data by\nsuperimposing boosted spherical stars without solving the Euler equation. The\nspuriously excited neutron star oscillations seen in evolutions of such data\narise because such configurations lack the appropriate tidal deformations and\nare stationary in a linearly comoving---rather than rotating---frame. We\nconsider eccentric configurations at apoapsis that are instantaneously\nstationary in a rotating frame. We extend the notion of helical symmetry to\neccentric orbits, by approximating the elliptical orbit of each companion as\ninstantaneously circular, using the ellipse's inscribed circle. The two\ninscribed helical symmetry vectors give rise to approximate instantaneous first\nintegrals of the Euler equation throughout each companion. We use these\nintegrals as the basis of a self-consistent iteration of the Einstein\nconstraints to construct conformal thin-sandwich initial data for eccentric\nbinaries. We find that the spurious stellar oscillations are reduced by at\nleast an order of magnitude, compared with those found in evolutions of\nsuperposed initial data. The tidally induced oscillations, however, are\nphysical and qualitatively similar to earlier evolutions.

We conclude by exploring the exciting prospects for mass and spin\nmeasurements from future gravitational wave detections, which are expected to\nrevolutionize our understanding of strong gravity and compact objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 20:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Upon its arrival, a job should be assigned to a server. Each job has a\nsize which defines the amount of resources that it needs. Servers have uniform\ncapacity and, at all times, the total size of jobs assigned to a server should\nnot exceed the capacity. This setting is closely related to the classic bin\npacking problem. The difference is that, in bin packing, the objective is to\nminimize the total number of used servers. In the Cloud, however, the charge\nfor each server is proportional to the length of the time interval it is rented\nfor, and the goal is to minimize the cost involved in renting all used servers.\nRecently, certain bin packing strategies were considered for renting servers in\nthe Cloud [Li et al.

Finally, we introduce a simple algorithm called Move To Front (MTF)\nwhich has a competitive ratio of at most $6\\mu + 7$ and also promising\naverage-case performance. We experimentally study the average-case performance\nof different algorithms and observe that the typical behaviour of MTF is\ndistinctively better than other algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 20:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-20"}

Methods: We implement the model\noptimization by minimizing a suitably constructed chi-square objective function\nusing various properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars.

Here, we investigate the role that\nspatial resolution plays in this apparent conflict. We use a recent catalogue\nof young ($<10$~Myr) massive ($>5000$~\\msun) clusters in the nearby spiral\ngalaxy, M83, along with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging in the optical and\nnear-IR, and ground based near-IR imaging, to see how the colours (and hence\nestimated properties such as age and extinction) are affected by the aperture\nsize employed, in order to simulate studies of differing resolution. We find\nthat the near-IR is heavily affected by the resolution, and when aperture sizes\n$>40$~pc are used, all young/blue clusters move red-ward in colour space, which\nresults in their appearance as heavily extincted clusters. However, this is due\nto contamination from nearby sources and nebular emission, and is not an\nextinction effect. Optical colours are much less affected by resolution. Due to\nthe larger affect of contamination in the near-IR, we find that, in some cases,\nclusters will appear to show near-IR excess when large ($>20$~pc) apertures are\nused. Our results explain why few young ($<6$~Myr), low extinction ($\\av <\n1$~mag) clusters have been found in recent ground based near-IR studies of\ncluster populations, while many such clusters have been found in higher\nresolution HST based studies. Additionally, resolution effects appear to (at\nleast partially) explain the origin of the near-IR excess that has been found\nin a number of extragalactic YMCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 21:35:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In this paper, we investigate if\nan interaction between the SN ejecta and the companion star may result in\nobservable footprints around the maximum brightness and thereafter, by\nperforming multi-dimensional radiation transfer simulations based on\nhydrodynamic simulations of the interaction. We find that such systems result\nin variations in various observational characteristics due to different viewing\ndirections, while the predicted behaviors (redder and fainter for the companion\ndirection) are opposite to what were suggested by the previous study. The\nvariations are generally modest and within observed scatters. However, the\nmodel predicts trends between some observables different from observationally\nderived, thus a large sample of SNe Ia with small calibration errors may be\nused to constrain the existence of such a companion star. The variations in\ndifferent colors in optical band passes can be mimicked by external\nextinctions, thus such an effect could be a source of a scatter in the peak\nluminosity and derived distance. After the peak, hydrogen-rich materials\nexpelled from the companion will manifest themselves in hydrogen lines.\nH$\\alpha$ is however extremely difficult to identify.

A straightforward way to tackle the assimilation\nproblem in such systems is to concatenate the states of the sub-systems into\none augmented state vector, so that a standard ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)\ncan be directly applied. In this work we present a divided state-space\nestimation strategy, in which data assimilation is carried out with respect to\neach individual sub-system, involving quantities from the sub-system itself and\ncorrelated quantities from other coupled sub-systems. On top of the divided\nstate-space estimation strategy, we also consider the possibility to run the\nsub-systems separately. Combining these two ideas, a few variants of the EnKF\nare derived. The introduction of these variants is mainly inspired by the\ncurrent status and challenges in coupled data assimilation problems, and thus\nmight be of interest from a practical point of view. Numerical experiments with\na multi-scale Lorentz 96 model are conducted to evaluate the performance of\nthese variants against that of the conventional EnKF. In addition, specific for\ncoupled data assimilation problems, two prototypes of extensions of the\npresented methods are also developed in order to achieve a trade-off between\nefficiency and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 07:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

These conjectures were proved by Foata and Zeilberger in 2001, and by\nFoata and Randrianarivony in 2006.\n  In 2010, Burstein refined some of these results by giving a bijection between\npermutations with a fixed value for the major index and those with the same\nvalue for STAT, where STAT is one of the statistics defined and proved to be\nMahonian in the 2000 Babson and Steingr\\'imsson's paper. Several other\nstatistics are preserved as well by Burstein's bijection.\n  At the Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics Conference (FPSAC) in\n2010, Burstein asked whether his bijection has other interesting properties. In\nthis paper, we not only show that Burstein's bijection preserves the Eulerian\nstatistic ides, but also use this fact, along with the bijection itself, to\nprove Mahonity of the statistic STAT on words we introduce in this paper. The\nwords statistic STAT introduced by us here addresses a natural question on\nexistence of a Mahonian words analogue of STAT on permutations. While proving\nMahonity of our STAT on words, we prove a more general joint equidistribution\nresult involving two six-tuples of statistics on (dense) words, where\nBurstein's bijection plays an important role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 10:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-20"}

As the neutrons are\nsuperfluid their angular momentum is carried by an array of quantized vortices.\nThese vortices can pin to the nuclear lattice and prevent the neutron\nsuperfluid from spinning down, allowing it to store angular momentum which can\nthen be released catastrophically, giving rise to a pulsar glitch. A crucial\ningredient for this model is the maximum pinning force that the lattice can\nexert on the vortices, as this allows us to estimate the angular momentum that\ncan be exchanged during a glitch. In this paper we perform, for the first time,\na detailed and quantitative calculation of the pinning force \\emph{per unit\nlength} acting on a vortex immersed in the crust and resulting from the\nmesoscopic vortex-lattice interaction. We consider realistic vortex tensions,\nallow for displacement of the nuclei and average over all possible orientation\nof the crystal with respect to the vortex. We find that, as expected, the\nmesoscopic pinning force becomes weaker for longer vortices and is generally\nmuch smaller than previous estimates, based on vortices aligned with the\ncrystal. Nevertheless the forces we obtain still have maximum values of order\n$f_{\\rm{pin}}\\approx 10^{15}$ dyn/cm, which would still allow for enough\nangular momentum to be stored in the crust to explain large Vela glitches, if\npart of the star is decoupled during the event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 11:18:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2015 21:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-10"}

The scheme is compared to results calculated from a `classical'\nprescription. Using our stellar binary evolution code BINSTAR, we calculate the\norbital evolution of Algol binaries undergoing case A and case B mass transfer,\nby applying the osculating scheme. The velocities of the ejected and accreted\nmaterial are evaluated by solving the restricted three-body equations of\nmotion, within the ballistic approximation. This allows us to determine the\nchange of linear momentum of each star, and the gravitational force applied by\nthe mass transfer stream. Torques applied on the stellar spins by tides and\nmass transfer are also considered. Using the osculating formalism gives shorter\npost-mass transfer orbital periods typically by a factor of 4 compared to the\nclassical scheme, owing to the gravitational force applied onto the stars by\nthe mass transfer stream. Additionally, during the rapid phase of mass\nexchange, the donor star is spun down on a timescale shorter than the tidal\nsynchronization timescale, leading to sub-synchronous rotation. Consequently,\nbetween 15 and 20 per cent of the material leaving the inner-Lagrangian point\nis accreted back onto the donor (so-called `self-accretion'), further enhancing\norbital shrinkage. Self-accretion, and the sink of orbital angular momentum\nwhich mass transfer provides, may potentially lead to more contact binaries.\nEven though Algols are mainly considered, the osculating prescription is\napplicable to all types of interacting binaries, including those with eccentric\norbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 12:11:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 10:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-15"}

Although many authors have so far investigated the effects\nof the drag force, gravitational force and electric force on the dust grains,\nthe lift force has never been considered as a force exerted on the dust grains\nin the gas disk. If the grains are spinning and moving in the fluid, then the\nlift force is exerted on them. We show in this paper that the dust grains can\nbe continuously spinning due to the frequent collisions so that the lift force\ncontinues to be exerted on them, which is valid in a certain parameter space\nwhere the grain size is larger than ~ 1 m and where the distance from the\ncentral star is larger than 1 AU for the minimum mass solar nebula. In\naddition, we estimate the effects of the force on the grain motion and obtain\nthe result that the mean relative velocity between the grains due to the lift\nforce is comparable to the gas velocity in the Kepler rotational frame when the\nStokes number and lift-drag ratio are both ~ 1. This estimation is performed\nunder the assumptions of the steady state and the isotropic spin angular\nmomentum. We also estimate the mean relative velocity when the grains keep\nspinning and conclude that the lift force marginally affects the mean relative\nvelocity in the minimum mass solar nebula.

The motion of the large-scale\nmagnetic rope away from the Sun changes the surrounding magnetic field lines in\nthe corona, and these changes resemble the half-period of a wave running along\nthe streamer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 13:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

However, not all relevant images represent a concept\nequally well. In other words, they are not necessarily iconic. This observation\nraises three questions. Is iconicity a subjective property? If not, can we\npredict iconicity? And what exactly makes an image iconic? We provide answers\nto these questions through an extensive experimental study on a challenging\nfine-grained dataset of birds. We first show that iconicity ratings are\nconsistent across individuals, even when they are not domain experts, thus\ndemonstrating that iconicity is not purely subjective. We then consider an\nexhaustive list of properties that are intuitively related to iconicity and\nmeasure their correlation with these iconicity ratings. We combine them to\npredict iconicity of new unseen images. We also propose a direct iconicity\npredictor that is discriminatively trained with iconicity ratings. By combining\nboth systems, we get an iconicity prediction that approaches human performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 13:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-20"}

In order to\nsurpass this limitation, one of the authors [X. Oriols, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2007,\n98 (066803)] has recently proposed a new model to study electron-electron\ncorrelations from Bohm trajectories associated to time-dependent wave-packets\nsolutions of pseudo single-particle Schr\\\"odinger equations. In the\naforementioned paper only the orbital exchange interaction is considered\nassuming that all electrons have the same spin orientation. Then, the\nmany-particle wave function is a complex Slater determinant of the\nsingle-particle wave-packets. In the present work the previous formalism is\nextended to study many-particle wave functions where the electrons have\ndifferent spin orientations.The main difficulty to treat N different electron\nspin orientations with time-dependent wave-packets is that one must study all\nthe possible N!N! products of permutations among spin states. To overcome this\ncomputationally inaccessible problem, in this article the total wave function\nis treated as a separated product of two many-particle wave functions, the\nfirst with spin up and the second with spin down. In order to numerically\njustify this approximation, the Bohm velocity in different antisymmetric total\nwave-function scenarios is computed. The computational results confirms the\naccurate validity of our approximation under a large number of cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 14:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-20"}

In this paper, we investigate the impact of residual\ntransmit RF impairments (RTRI) on the spectral and energy efficiency of\ntraining-based point-to-point large-scale MIMO systems, and seek to determine\nthe optimal training length and number of antennas which maximize the energy\nefficiency.

The problem originates from the study of the spread of information or\nconsensus in a network and was introduced in this form by V.Borkar et al. in\n2010. More generally, the work of A. Clark et al. in 2012 showed that\nestimating the fastest rate of convergence to consensus of so-called leader\nfollower systems leads to a consideration of the same optimization problem.\n  The set function $F$ to be minimized is supermodular and therefore the greedy\nalgorithm is commonly used to construct optimal sets or their approximations.\nIn this paper, the problem is reformulated so that the search for solutions is\nrestricted to optimal and near optimal subsets of the graph. We prove\nsufficient conditions for the existence of a greedoid structure that contains\nfeasible optimal and near optimal sets.

Every considered BL model is divided into a number of\nrings, and for each ring, a structure model along the vertical direction is\ncomputed using the stellar-atmosphere method. The ring spectra are then\ncombined into a BL spectrum taking Doppler broadening and limb darkening into\naccount. Two sets of model BL spectra are computed, the first of them consists\nof BL models with fixed white dwarf (WD) mass (1 M_sun) and various relative WD\nangular velocities (0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 break-up velocities), while the other\ndeals with a fixed relative angular velocity (0.8 break-up velocity) and\nvarious WD masses (0.8, 1, and 1.2 M_sun). The model spectra show broad\nabsorption features because of blending of numerous absorption lines, and\nemission-like features at spectral regions with only a few strong absorption\nlines. The model spectra are very similar to observed soft X-ray/EUV spectra of\nSS Cyg and U Gem in outburst. The observed SS Cyg spectrum could be fitted by\nBL model spectra with WD masses 0.8 - 1 M_sun and relative angular velocities\n0.6 - 0.8 break up velocities. These BL models also reproduce the observed\nratio of BL luminosity and disk luminosity. The difference between the observed\nand the BL model spectra is similar to a hot optically thin plasma spectrum and\ncould be associated with the spectrum of outflowing plasma with a mass loss\nrate compatible with the BL mass accretion rate. The suggested method of\ncomputing BL spectra seems very promising and can be applied to other BL models\nfor comparison with EUV spectra of dwarf novae in outburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 15:46:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

The electromagnetic field is modeled as a reservoir of quantum harmonic\noscillators successively streaming past a quantum system. Each weak and\nfleeting interaction entangles the light and the system, and the light\ncontinues its course. Within the framework of open quantum systems, the light\nis eventually traced out, leaving the reduced quantum state of the system as\nthe primary mathematical subject. Two major results are presented. The first is\na master equation approach for a quantum system interacting with a traveling\nwave packet prepared with a definite number of photons. In contrast to\nquasi-classical states, such as coherent or thermal fields, these N-photon\nstates possess temporal mode entanglement, and local interactions in time have\nnonlocal consequences. The second is a model for a three-dimensional\nlight-matter interface for an atomic ensemble interacting with a paraxial laser\nbeam and its application to the generation of QND spin squeezing. Both coherent\nand incoherent dynamics due to spatially inhomogeneous atom-light coupling\nacross the ensemble are accounted for. Measurement of paraxially scattered\nlight can generate squeezing of an atomic spin wave, while diffusely scattered\nphotons lead to spatially local decoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 20:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-21"}

The Noether charge, related to time\nevolution vector field, in a bulk region of space is equal to the heat content\n$TS$ of the boundary surface with the temperature $T$ defined using local\nRindler observers and $S$ being the Wald entropy. Using the Wald entropy to\ndefine the surface degrees of freedom $N_{sur}$ and Komar energy density to\ndefine the bulk degrees of freedom $N_{bulk}$, we can also show that the time\nevolution of the geometry is sourced by $(N_{sur}-N_{bulk})$.

The resulting stochastic\nQHA dynamics much depend by the strength of the interaction: Strongly bounded\nsystems (such as linear ones) lead to quantum entangled stochastic behavior,\nwhile weakly bounded ones may be not able to maintain the quantum superposition\nof states on large distances and may loose their macro-scale quantum coherence\nacquiring the classical stochastic evolution .

Here we present a brief investigation of the structure of Vainshtein\nscreening in symmetrical configurations, focusing in particular on the\nspherical, cylindrical and planar solutions that are relevant for observations\nof the cosmic web. We consider Vainshtein screening in both the Galileon model,\nwhere the non-linear terms involve second derivatives of the scalar, and a\nk-essence theory, where the non-linear terms involve only first derivatives of\nthe scalar. We find that screening, and consequently the suppression of the\nscalar force, is most efficient around spherical sources, weaker around\ncylindrical sources and can be absent altogether around planar sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 19:59:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2015 01:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-18"}

From this\nexample, it is shown that the Hermitian conjugates of the basis do not\nanticommute with the basis and, therefore, the property that \"Grassmann\nnumbers\" commute with \"bosonic quantities\" and anticommute with \"fermionic\nquantities\", must be revised.

The dynamical system of equations is solved numerically and a stable\nscaling solution is obtained. A significant attempt towards the solution of the\ncosmic coincidence problem is taken.

Applying the octonionic representation enables one single definition of\nangular momentum (or torque, force) to combine some physics contents, which\nwere considered to be independent of each other in the past. J. C. Maxwell used\nsimultaneously two methods, the vector terminology and quaternion analysis, to\ndepict the electromagnetic theory. It motivates the paper to introduce the\nquaternion space into the field theory, describing the physical feature of\nelectromagnetic and gravitational fields. The spaces of two fields can be\nchosen as the quaternion spaces, while the coordinate component of quaternion\nspace is able to be the complex number. The quaternion space of electromagnetic\nfield is independent of that of gravitational field. These two quaternion\nspaces may compose one octonion space. Contrarily, one octonion space can be\nseparated into two subspaces, the quaternion space and S-quaternion space. In\nthe quaternion space, it is able to infer the field potential, field strength,\nfield source, angular momentum, torque, and force etc in the gravitational\nfield. In the S-quaternion space, it is capable of deducing the field\npotential, field strength, field source, current continuity equation, and\nelectric (or magnetic) dipolar moment etc in the electromagnetic field. The\nresults reveal that the quaternion space is appropriate to describe the\ngravitational features, including the torque, force, and mass continuity\nequation etc. The S-quaternion space is proper to depict the electromagnetic\nfeatures, including the dipolar moment and current continuity equation etc. In\ncase the field strength is weak enough, the force and the continuity equation\netc can be respectively reduced to that in the classical field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 11:41:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 12:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-22"}
