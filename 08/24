This makes them potentially suitable for learning and\nrecognizing a higher number of object classes. However, the success of the\nhierarchical approaches so far has been hindered by the use of hand-crafted\nfeatures or predetermined grouping rules. This paper presents a novel framework\nfor learning a hierarchical compositional shape vocabulary for representing\nmultiple object classes. The approach takes simple contour fragments and learns\ntheir frequent spatial configurations. These are recursively combined into\nincreasingly more complex and class-specific shape compositions, each exerting\na high degree of shape variability. At the top-level of the vocabulary, the\ncompositions are sufficiently large and complex to represent the whole shapes\nof the objects. We learn the vocabulary layer after layer, by gradually\nincreasing the size of the window of analysis and reducing the spatial\nresolution at which the shape configurations are learned. The lower layers are\nlearned jointly on images of all classes, whereas the higher layers of the\nvocabulary are learned incrementally, by presenting the algorithm with one\nobject class after another. The experimental results show that the learned\nmulti-class object representation scales favorably with the number of object\nclasses and achieves a state-of-the-art detection performance at both, faster\ninference as well as shorter training times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Aug 2014 17:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

While small FRs\nare crossed by the observing spacecraft within few hours, with a radius\ntypically less than 0.1AU, larger FRs, or magnetic clouds (hereafter, MCs),\nhave durations of about half a day.\n  The main aim of this study is to compare the properties of both populations\nof FRs observed by the Wind spacecraft at 1 AU.\n  To do so, we use standard correlation techniques for the FR parameters, as\nwell as histograms and more refined statistical methods. Although several\nproperties seem at first different for small FRs and MCs, we show that they are\nactually governed by the same propagation physics. For example, we observe no\nin situ signatures of expansion for small FRs, contrary to MCs. We demonstrate\nthat this result is in fact expected: small FRs expand similarly to MCs, as a\nconsequence of a total pressure balance with the surrounding medium, but the\nexpansion signature is well hidden by velocity fluctuations.\n  Next, we find that the FR radius, velocity and magnetic field strength are\nall positively correlated, with correlation factors than can reach a value\n>0.5. This result indicates a remnant trace of the FR ejection process from the\ncorona. We also find a larger FR radius at the apex than at the legs (up to\nthree times larger at the apex), for FR observed at 1 AU.\n  Finally, assuming that the detected FRs have a large-scale configuration in\nthe heliosphere, we derived the mean axis shape from the probability\ndistribution of the axis orientation. We therefore interpret the small FR and\nMC properties in a common framework of FRs interacting with the solar wind, and\nwe disentangle the physics present behind their common and different features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Aug 2014 18:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

At hadron colliders the dominant\nfraction of hits is due to low momentum tracks for which multiple scattering\n(MS) effects dominate the hit resolution. MS is also the dominating source for\nhit confusion and track uncertainties in low energy precision experiments. In\nall such environments, where MS dominates, track reconstruction and fitting can\nbe largely simplified by using three-dimensional (3D) hit-triplets as provided\nby pixel detectors. This simplification is possible since track uncertainties\nare solely determined by MS if high precision spatial information is provided.\nFitting of hit-triplets is especially simple for tracking detectors in\nsolenoidal magnetic fields. The over-constrained 3D-triplet method provides a\ncomplete set of track parameters and is robust against fake hit combinations.\nThe triplet method is ideally suited for pixel detectors where hits can be\ntreated as 3D-space points. With the advent of relatively cheap and\nindustrially available CMOS-sensors the construction of highly granular full\nscale pixel tracking detectors seems to be possible also for experiments at LHC\nor future high energy (hadron) colliders. In this paper tracking performance\nstudies for full-scale pixel detectors, including their optimisation for\n3D-triplet tracking, are presented. The results obtained for different types of\ntracker geometries and different reconstruction methods are compared. The\npotential of reducing the number of tracking layers and -- along with that --\nthe material budget using this new tracking concept is discussed.

In this\nhovering model, both the position and attitude of the spacecraft are kept to be\nstationary in the asteroid body-fixed frame. A Hamiltonian structure-based\nfeedback control law is proposed to stabilize the relative equilibria of the\nfull dynamics to achieve the orbit-attitude hovering. The control law is\nconsisted of two parts: potential shaping and energy dissipation. The potential\nshaping is to make the relative equilibrium a minimum of the modified\nHamiltonian on the invariant manifold by modifying the potential artificially.\nWith the energy-Casimir method, it is shown that the unstable relative\nequilibrium can always be stabilized in the Lyapunov sense by the potential\nshaping with sufficiently large feedback gains. Then the energy dissipation\nleads the motion to converge asymptotically to the minimum of the modified\nHamiltonian on the invariant manifold, i.e., the relative equilibrium. The\nfeasibility of the proposed stabilization control law is validated through\nnumerical simulations in the case of a spacecraft orbiting around a small\nasteroid. The main advantage of the proposed hovering control law is that it is\nvery simple and is easy to implement autonomously by the spacecraft with little\ncomputation. This advantage is attributed to the utilization of dynamical\nbehaviors of the system in the control design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Aug 2014 05:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

First, it increases upon lowering\nsurfactant coverage from saturation. Second, it does not vanish in the limit of\nlow coverage, but instead approaches a finite value. This behavior is\nrationalized by taking into account the key role of interfacial hydrodynamics,\ntogether with an ion-binding mechanism. We point out implications of these\nresults for the strongly debated measurements of zeta potential at free\ninterfaces, and for electrokinetic transport in liquid foams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Aug 2014 06:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

The observed\nresponse to slowly varying electric field is interpreted by means of a simple\nmodel where the interaction between the charge carrier and lattice polarization\nmodes is simulated by a harmonic interaction between a fictitious particle and\nan electron embedded in a viscous fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Aug 2014 09:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-26"}

The spacetime is a kind of canonical parameter space\ndefined by the Fisher information metric. As a concrete example, we focus on\nthe spectrum for free fermions in spatially one dimension. The spectrum has\nexponential family form like thermal probability distribution owing to\nmixed-state feature emerging from truncation of environmental degrees of\nfreedom. In this case, the Fisher metric is given by the second derivative of\nthe Hessian potential that can be identified with the entanglement entropy. We\nemphasize that the canonical parameters are nontrivial functions of partial\nsystem size by the truncation, filling fraction of fermions, and time. Then,\nthe precise determination of this nontrivial mapping is necessary to derive the\nfunctional form of the Hessian potential that leads to correct entanglement\nentropy scaling. By this potential, we find that the emergent geometry becomes\nanti-de Sitter spacetime with imaginary time, and a radial axis as well as\nspacetime coordinates appears spontaneously. We also find that the information\nof the UV limit of the original free fermions lives in the boundary of the\nanti-de Sitter spacetime. These findings strongly suggest that the Hessian\npotential for free fermions has enough geometrical meaning associated with\ngauge-gravity correspondence. Furthermore, some deformation of the spectrum\nnear the conformal fixed point is mapped onto spacetime dynamics. The\nfluctuation of the entanglement entropy embedded into the spacetime behaves\nlike free scaler field, and the dynamics is described by the Einstein equation\nwith a negative cosmological constant. Therefore, the Einstein equation can be\nregarded as the equation of original quantum state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Aug 2014 10:32:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 15:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 13:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-04"}

Thus, there have been many paradigms\ndeveloped to decrease the complexity of the de Bruijn graph. One obvious\ncombinatorial paradigm for this is to allow the value of $k$ to vary; having a\nlarger value of $k$ where the graph is more complex and a smaller value of $k$\nwhere the graph would likely contain fewer spurious edges and vertices. One\nopen problem that affects the practicality of this method is how to predict the\nvalue of $k$ prior to building the de Bruijn graph. We show that optimal values\nof $k$ can be predicted prior to assembly by using the information contained in\na phylogenetically-close genome and therefore, help make the use of multiple\nvalues of $k$ practical for genome assembly.\n  Results: We present HyDA-Vista, which is a genome assembler that uses\nhomology information to choose a value of $k$ for each read prior to the de\nBruijn graph construction. The chosen $k$ is optimal if there are no sequencing\nerrors and the coverage is sufficient. Fundamental to our method is the\nconstruction of the {\\em maximal sequence landscape}, which is a data structure\nthat stores for each position in the input string, the largest repeated\nsubstring containing that position.

The reads are then aligned to this reference genome, and values of $k$\nare assigned to each read using the maximal sequence landscape and the\nalignments. Eventually, all the reads are assembled by an iterative de Bruijn\ngraph construction method.

Several new affine\nisoperimetric inequalities are established. The connection between the\ncharacterization of Orlicz-Legendre ellipsoids and isotropy of measures is\ndemonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Aug 2014 09:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}
