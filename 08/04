At query time,\ngiven g, G and a regular path query R, the approach decomposes R into a set of\nsubqueries R1, ..., Rk that are safe for G. For each safe subquery Ri, G is\nrewritten so that, using the reachability labels of nodes in g, whether or not\nthere is a path which matches Ri between two nodes can be decided in constant\ntime. The results of each safe subquery are then composed, possibly with some\nsmall unsafe remainder, to produce an answer to R.

This standard path loss model is quite idealized, and\nin most scenarios the path loss exponent $\\alpha$ is itself a function of\n$\\|x\\|$, typically an increasing one. Enforcing a single path loss exponent can\nlead to orders of magnitude differences in average received and interference\npowers versus the true values. In this paper we study \\emph{multi-slope} path\nloss models, where different distance ranges are subject to different path loss\nexponents. We focus on the dual-slope path loss function, which is a piece-wise\npower law and continuous and accurately approximates many practical scenarios.\nWe derive the distributions of SIR, SNR, and finally SINR before finding the\npotential throughput scaling, which provides insight on the observed\ncell-splitting rate gain. The exact mathematical results show that the SIR\nmonotonically decreases with network density, while the converse is true for\nSNR, and thus the network coverage probability in terms of SINR is maximized at\nsome finite density.

Due\nto the possibly drastic intensity increase of an input coherent light in the\ngain-loss waveguide couplers with parity-time (PT) symmetry, the Kerr effect\nfrom a nonlinearity added into the systems can be greatly enhanced, and is\nexpected to create the macroscopic entangled states of the output light fields\nwith huge photon numbers. Meanwhile, the quantum noises also coexist with the\namplification and dissipation of the light fields. Under the interplay between\nthe quantum noises and nonlinearity, the quantum dynamical behaviors of the\nsystems become rather complicated. However, the important quantum noise effects\nhave been mostly neglected in the previous studies about nonlinear PT-symmetric\nsystems. Here we present a solution to this non-perturbative quantum nonlinear\nproblem, showing the real-time evolution of the system observables. The\nenhanced Kerr nonlinearity is found to give rise to a previously unknown\ndecoherence effect that is irrelevant to the quantum noises, and imposes a\nlimit on the emergence of macroscopic nonclassicality. In contrast to what\nhappen in the linear systems, the quantum noises exert significant impact on\nthe system dynamics, and can create the nonclassical light field states in\nconjunction with the enhanced Kerr nonlinearity. This first study on the noise\ninvolved quantum nonlinear dynamics of the coupled gain-loss waveguides can\nhelp to better understand the quantum noise effects in the broad nonlinear\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2014 01:56:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 16:52:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2014 15:25:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2014 15:00:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 17:21:16 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 30 Jan 2015 19:07:44 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 02:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-27"}

The model was constructed for the\nmagnetically active Mn $3d$ bands in the basis of Wannier functions and include\nthe effect of screened on-site Coulomb interactions. The essence of our\napproach for the FE polarization is to use the Berry phase theory, formulated\nin terms of occupied Wannier functions, and to evaluate the asymmetric\nspin-dependent change of these functions in the framework of the DE model. This\nenables us to quantify the effect of the magnetic symmetry breaking and derive\nseveral useful expressions for the electronic polarization ${\\bf P}$, depending\non the relative directions of spins. The proposed theory is applied to the\nsolution of three major problems: (i) The magnetic-state dependence of ${\\bf\nP}$ in hexagonal manganites; (ii) The microscopic relationship between canted\nferromagnetism and ${\\bf P}$ in monoclinic BiMnO$_3$; (iii) The origin of FE\nactivity in orthorhombic manganites. We show that for an arbitrary noncollinear\nmagnetic structure, propagating along the orthorhombic $\\boldsymbol{b}$ axis\nand antiferromagnetically coupled $\\boldsymbol{c}$, ${\\bf P}$ can be obtained\nby scaling the one of the E-phase with the prefactor depending only on the\nrelative directions of spins and being the measure of the spin inhomogeneity.\nThis picture works equally well for the twofold (HoMnO$_3$) and fourfold\n(TbMnO$_3$) periodic manganites. The basic difference is that the twofold\nperiodic magnetic structure is strongly inhomogeneous, that leads to large\n${\\bf P}$. On the contrary, the fourfold periodic magnetic structure can be\nviewed as a moderately distorted homogeneous spin spiral, which corresponds to\nweaker ${\\bf P}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2014 04:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

We\nprove that in both synchronous and partially synchronous systems, approximate\nconsensus is solvable if and only if the communication graph in each round has\na rooted spanning tree, i.e., there is a coordinator at each time. The striking\npoint in this result is that the coordinator is not required to be unique and\ncan change arbitrarily from round to round. Interestingly, the class of\naveraging algorithms, which are memoryless and require no process identifiers,\nentirely captures the solvability issue of approximate consensus in that the\nproblem is solvable if and only if it can be solved using any averaging\nalgorithm. Concerning the time complexity of averaging algorithms, we show that\napproximate consensus can be achieved with precision of $\\varepsilon$ in a\ncoordinated network model in $O(n^{n+1} \\log\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$ synchronous\nrounds, and in $O(\\Delta n^{n\\Delta+1} \\log\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$ rounds when\nthe maximum round delay for a message to be delivered is $\\Delta$. While in\ngeneral, an upper bound on the time complexity of averaging algorithms has to\nbe exponential, we investigate various network models in which this exponential\nbound in the number of nodes reduces to a polynomial bound. We apply our\nresults to networked systems with a fixed topology and classical benign fault\nmodels, and deduce both known and new results for approximate consensus in\nthese systems. In particular, we show that for solving approximate consensus, a\ncomplete network can tolerate up to 2n-3 arbitrarily located link faults at\nevery round, in contrast with the impossibility result established by Santoro\nand Widmayer (STACS '89) showing that exact consensus is not solvable with n-1\nlink faults per round originating from the same node.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2014 09:27:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 10:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-13"}

While the\ndiffusion constant in the last diffusive regime naturally increases with\nactivity and decreases with packing fraction, we exhibit an intriguing\nnon-monotonic dependence on the activity of the ratio between the finite\ndensity and the single particle diffusion constants. At fixed packing fraction,\nthe time-integrated linear response function depends non-monotonically on\nactivity strength. The effective temperature extracted from the ratio between\nthe integrated linear response and the mean-square displacement in the last\ndiffusive regime is always higher than the ambient temperature, increases with\nincreasing activity and, for small active force it monotonically increases with\ndensity while for sufficiently high activity it first increases to next\ndecrease with the packing fraction.

Being sensitive to initial values, the method produces\nasymptotically correct solutions. The computations are fast, with time\ncomplexity being quadratic. We apply the reconstruction to data of measles\n(England and Wales, 1948-67), dengue (Thailand, 1982-99), and influenza (U.S.,\n1910-27). The Measles example offers comparison with earlier work.

This paper proposes a novel\ntraffic signal controller with two fuzzy layers for signalizing the roundabout.\nThe outer layer of the controller computes urgency degrees of all the phase\nsubsets and then activates the most urgent subset. This mechanism helps to\ninstantly respond to the current traffic condition of the roundabout so as to\nimprove real-timeness. The inner layer of the controller computes extension\ntime of the current phase. If the extension value is larger than a threshold\nvalue, the current phase is maintained; otherwise the next phase in the running\nphase subset (selected by the outer layer) is activated. The inner layer adopts\nwell-designed phase sequences, which helps to smooth the traffic flows and to\navoid traffic jam. In general, the proposed traffic signal controller is\ncapable of improving real-timeness as well as reducing traffic congestion.\nMoreover, an offline particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed\nto optimize the membership functions adopted in the proposed controller. By\nusing optimal membership functions, the performance of the controller can be\nfurther improved.

Two notable properties, stemming from weakened annihilating\nconditions, reveal that the component functions of the generalized ADD have\n\\emph{zero} means and are hierarchically orthogonal. By exploiting these\nproperties, a simple, alternative approach is presented to derive a coupled\nsystem of equations that the generalized ADD component functions satisfy. The\ncoupled equations, which subsume as a special case the classical ADD, reproduce\nthe component functions for independent probability measures. To determine the\ncomponent functions of the generalized ADD, a new constructive method is\nproposed by employing measure-consistent, multivariate orthogonal polynomials\nas bases and calculating the expansion coefficients involved from the solution\nof linear algebraic equations. New generalized formulae are presented for the\nsecond-moment characteristics, including triplets of global sensitivity\nindices, for dependent probability distributions. Furthermore, the generalized\nADD leads to extended definitions of effective dimensions, reported in the\ncurrent literature for the classical ADD. Numerical results demonstrate that\nthe correlation structure of random variables can significantly alter the\ncomposition of component functions, producing widely varying global sensitivity\nindices and, therefore, distinct rankings of random variables.

However, most of the existing vascular embolic agents are still\nrather insufficient to fulfill the real clinical need due to the reasons like:\nincomplete filling of target vasculature, being easily washed away by blood or\nbody solution, or just producing toxicity to tissues. Here from an alternative\nway, the body temperature liquid metal, a kind of soft and highly compliant\nmaterial, was proposed for the first time as blood vessel embolization agent\nfor tumor physical therapy. With its unique capability of easy phase transition\nbetween liquid and solid state and sub-cooling behavior, such material can be\nfluently injected into the tiny vessels including ending capillaries and fully\nblock them. The in vitro cytotoxicity experiments were performed which showed\nthat treating localized diseased tissues through liquid metal embolic agent is\nacceptable.

This\nframework was applied to investigate spatially developing flat plate turbulent\nboundary layer up to momentum thickness Reynolds number, $R_{\\theta} = 31000$\nand the results are compared with the available experimental data. Good\nagreement was obtained for the global quantities such as mean velocity and skin\nfriction at all momentum thickness Reynolds numbers considered. The trends\nobtained for the Reynolds stress components are in the right direction. At high\n$R_{\\theta$}, the shear stress distribution shows significant differences close\nto the wall indicating scope for further improving the near-wall modeling in\nsuch methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2014 04:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-06"}

Increasing by time radius of the\ngravitationally-bound region (GBR) and conservation of gravitational energy\nlead to a new scenario in which values of NP in expanding volume are\nmaintained, while in physical volume are stretched. Really, the energy\nconservation in expanding volume requires for NP values to be comoving to the\nexpanding shells. In addition, the radius of gravitationally-bound region\nincreases by time due to decreasing of expansion velocity and different shells\naround galaxy cease expansion at different times. Thus, as far a shell placed\nfrom galaxy, as longer it was expanded and thickened, while potential\ndifference on its boundaries remained unchanged. This shifts the values of NP\naround galaxy proportional to the distance r and, as the result, the\ngravitational acceleration, from NP's $1/r^2$ dependence, turned to 1/r\ndependence, as for centrifugal acceleration. This fact naturally explains the\nknown empirical facts, such as flatness of rotation curves and velocity-mass\nrelationships for galaxies and velocity dispersion in clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2014 01:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-23"}
