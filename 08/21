Although the advantage\nof Conic MTL over Average MTL has been shown experimentally in previous works,\nno theoretical justification has been provided to date. In this paper, we\nderive a generalization bound for the Conic MTL method, and demonstrate that\nthe tightest bound is not necessarily achieved, when all combination\ncoefficients equal 1; hence, Average MTL may not always be the optimal choice,\nand it is important to consider Conic MTL.

We propose that the spiral state is induced by a competition\nbetween the short-range antiferromagnetic exchange and a long-range interaction\ninduced by the polarization of Au bands, similar to double exchange. We find\nthat, contrary to earlier reports, the ground state in standard density\nfunctional theory is ferromagnetic, \\emph{i.e.}, the latter interaction\ndominates.

In contrast to prior work,\nhere we focus on a regime with strong interactions between the qubits. The\ninterplay of the interaction energy and simultaneous large detunings for both\ndouble dots gives rise to the double charge resonant regime, in which the\nunpolarized (1111) and fully polarized (0202) four-electron states in the\nabsence of interqubit tunneling are near degeneracy, while being energetically\nwell-separated from the partially polarized (0211 and 1102) states. A rapid\ncontrolled-phase gate may be realized by combining time evolution in this\nregime in the presence of intraqubit tunneling and the interqubit Coulomb\ninteraction with refocusing ${\\pi}$ pulses that swap the singly occupied\nsinglet and triplet states of the two qubits via, e.g., magnetic gradients. We\ncalculate the fidelity of this entangling gate, incorporating models for two\ntypes of noise -- charge fluctuations in the single-qubit detunings and charge\nrelaxation within the low-energy subspace via electron-phonon interaction --\nand identify parameter regimes that optimize the fidelity. The rates of\nphonon-induced decay for pairs of GaAs or Si double quantum dots vary with the\nsizes of the dipolar and quadrupolar contributions and are several orders of\nmagnitude smaller for Si, leading to high theoretical gate fidelities for\ncoupled singlet-triplet qubits in Si dots.

Such\nblack holes are typically accompanied by flat-spectrum radio cores indicating\nthe presence of moderately relativistic jets. One of the best constrained RIAFs\nis associated with the SMBH in the Galactic center, Sgr A*. Since the plasma in\nRIAFs is only weakly collisional, the dynamics and the radiative properties of\nthese systems are very uncertain. Here we want to study the impact of varying\nelectron temperature on the appearance of accretion flows and jets. Using 3-D\nGRMHD accretion flow simulations, we use ray tracing methods to predict spectra\nand radio images of RIAFs allowing for different electron heating mechanisms in\nthe in- and outflowing parts of the simulations. We find that small changes in\nthe electron temperature can result in dramatic differences in the relative\ndominance of jets and accretion flows. Application to Sgr A* shows that radio\nspectrum and size of this source can be well reproduced with a model where\nelectrons are more efficiently heated in the jet. The X-ray emission is\nsensitive to the electron heating mechanism in the jets and disk and therefore\nX-ray observations put strong constraints on electron temperatures and geometry\nof the accretion flow and jet. For Sgr A*, the jet model also predicts a\nsignificant frequency-dependent core shift which could place independent\nconstraints on the model once measured accurately. We conclude that more\nsophisticated models for electron distribution functions are crucial for\nconstraining GRMHD simulations with actual observations. For Sgr A*, the radio\nappearance may well be dominated by the outflowing plasma. Nonetheless, at the\nhighest radio frequencies, the shadow of the event horizon should still be\ndetectable with future Very Long Baseline Interferometric observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 17:57:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2014 22:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

For DAG-width games, it is an\nopen question whether the robber-monotonicity cost (the difference between the\nminimal numbers of cops capturing the robber in the general and in the monotone\ncase) can be bounded by any function. Examples show that this function (if it\nexists) is at least $f(k) > 4k/3$ (Kreutzer, Ordyniak 2008).

For\ninfinitely long cylinders, F is a maximum at lambda=0, and decreases with\nlambda until the polymers are no longer in contact.

We use a simple model where the particles undergo\nrepeated 'kicks' due to the swimmers to explain the shape of the distribution\nas a function of the volume fraction of swimmers. The net displacement is\ndetermined by the inverse Fourier transform of a single-swimmer characteristic\nfunction. The only adjustable parameter is the strength of the stresslet term\nin our spherical squirmer model. We give a criterion for convergence to a\nGaussian distribution in terms of moments of the drift function, and show that\nthe experimentally-observed diffusive scaling is a transient related to the\nslow crossover of the fourth moment from a ballistic to a linear regime with\npath length. We also present a simple model, with logarithmic drift\nfunction,that can be solved analytically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 19:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2015 18:07:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2015 14:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-26"}

We note that stochastic fluctuations can possibly confer a new\ndynamical capability to a network. Thus, it is of tremendous value to\nunderstand and be able to control the landscape of stochastic dynamical\nbehaviors of a biochemical reaction network as a function of network\narchitecture. Here we investigate such a case where stochastic fluctuations can\ngive rise to the new capability of noise-induced oscillation in a subset of\nbiochemical reaction networks, the networks with only three biochemical species\nwhose reactions are governed by mass action kinetics and with the coupling of\npositive and negative feedback loops. We model the networks with the master\nequations and approximate them, using the linear noise approximation. For each\nnetwork, we read the signal-to-noise ratio value, an indicator of amplified and\ncoherent noise-induced oscillation, off from the analytically derived power\nspectra. We classify the networks into three performance groups based on the\naverage values of the signal-to-noise ratio and the robustness. We identify the\ncommon network architecture among the networks belonging to the same\nperformance group, from which we learn that the coupling of negative and\npositive feedback loops generally enhance the noise-induced oscillation\nperformance better than the negative feedback loops alone. The performance of\nnetworks also depends on the relative size of the positive and negative\nfeedback loops; the networks with the bigger positive and smaller negative\nfeedbacks are much worse oscillators than the networks with only negative\nfeedback loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 19:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-21"}

Observations at optical and near-infrared wavelengths,\nobtained with the WFC3 camera on board the Hubble Space Telescope, show that\nthe stars belonging to the red giant clump are spread across the\ncolour-magnitude diagrams because of the considerable and uneven levels of\nextinction in this region. Since these stars share very similar physical\nproperties and are all at the same distance, they allow us to derive the\nabsolute extinction in a straightforward and reliable way. Thus we have\nmeasured the extinction towards about 180 objects and the extinction law in the\nrange 0.3 - 1.6 micron. At optical wavelengths, the extinction curve is almost\nparallel to that of the diffuse Galactic interstellar medium. Taking the latter\nas a template, the value of Rv = 4.5 +/- 0.2 that we measure indicates that in\nthe optical there is an extra grey component due to a larger fraction of large\ngrains. At wavelengths longer than ~1 micron, the contribution of this\nadditional component tapers off as lambda^-1.5, like in the Milky Way,\nsuggesting that the nature of the grains is otherwise similar to those in our\nGalaxy, but with a ~2.2 times higher fraction of large grains.

Here we propose a new mechanism to explain the\nphysical origin of this correlation. We assume that while quiescent galaxies\nare maintained quenched by a feedback mechanism, cooling flows in the hot halo\ngas can still develop intermittently. We study cooling flows in a large suite\nof around 90 hydrodynamic simulations of an isolated galaxy group, and find\nthat the flow development depends significantly on the gravitational potential\nwell in the central galaxy. If the galaxy's gravity is not strong enough,\ncooling flows result in a central cooling catastrophe, supplying cold gas and\nfeeding star formation to galactic bulges. When the bulge grows prominent\nenough, compressional heating starts to offset radiative cooling and maintains\ncooling flows in a long-term hot mode without producing cooling catastrophe.\nOur model thus describes a self-limited growth channel for galaxy bulges, and\nnaturally explains the connection between quenching and bulge prominence. In\nparticular, we explicitly demonstrate that $M_{*}/R_{\\rm eff}^{1.5}$ is a good\nstructural predictor of quenching. We further find that the gravity from the\ncentral supermassive black hole also affects the bimodal fate of cooling flows,\nand predict a more general quenching predictor to be $M_{\\rm\nbh}^{1.6}M_{*}/R_{\\rm eff}^{1.5}$, which may be tested in future observational\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 20:03:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 21:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The\nmembrane-associated TatA protein is an essential component of the Tat\ntranslocon, and a broad distribution of different sized TatA-clusters is\nobserved in bacterial membranes. We assume that the size dynamics of TatA\nclusters are affected by substrate binding, unbinding, and translocation to\nassociated TatBC clusters, where clusters with bound translocation substrates\nfavour growth and those without associated substrates favour shrinkage. With a\nstochastic model of substrate binding and cluster dynamics, we numerically\ndetermine the TatA cluster size distribution. We include a proportion of\ntargeted but non-translocatable (NT) substrates, with the simplifying\nhypothesis that the substrate translocatability does not directly affect\ncluster dynamical rate constants or substrate binding or unbinding rates. This\namounts to a translocation model without specific quality control.\nNevertheless, NT substrates will remain associated with TatA clusters until\nunbound and so will affect cluster sizes and translocation rates. We find that\nthe number of larger TatA clusters depends on the NT fraction $f$. The\ntranslocation rate can be optimized by tuning the rate of spontaneous substrate\nunbinding, $\\Gamma_U$. We present an analytically solvable three-state model of\nsubstrate translocation without cluster size dynamics that follows our computed\ntranslocation rates, and that is consistent with {\\em in vitro}\nTat-translocation data in the presence of NT substrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 20:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Strong dynamical excitation of planetesimals\nby the eccentric companion can result in collisional destruction (rather than\ngrowth) of 1-100 km objects, giving rise to the \"fragmentation barrier\" for\nplanet formation. We revise this issue using a novel description of secular\ndynamics of planetesimals in binaries, which accounts for the gravity of the\neccentric, coplanar protoplanetary disk, as well as gas drag. By studying\nplanetesimal collision outcomes we show, in contrast to many previous studies,\nthat planetesimal growth and subsequent formation of planets (including gas\ngiants) in AU-scale orbits within ~20 AU separation binaries may be possible,\nprovided that the protoplanetary disks are massive (>10^{-2}M_\\odot) and only\nweakly eccentric (disk eccentricity <0.01). These requirements are compatible\nwith both the existence of massive (several M_J) planets in gamma Cep-like\nsystems and the results of recent simulations of gaseous disks in eccentric\nbinaries. Terrestrial and Neptune-like planets can also form in lower-mass\ndisks at small (sub-AU) radii. We find that fragmentation barrier is less of a\nproblem in eccentric disks which are apsidally aligned with the binary orbit.\nAlignment gives rise to special locations, where (1) relative planetesimal\nvelocities are low and (2) the timescale of their drag-induced radial drift is\nlong.

In the spirit of the Yukawa-approach to the nuclear force\nproblem, the interactions are studied from the meson-exchange picture\nviewpoint, using generalized soft-core Yukawa-functions. These interactions are\nsupplemented with (i) multiple-gluon-exchange, and (ii) structural effects due\nto the quark-core of the baryons. The extended-soft-core (ESC) meson-exchange\ninteractions consist of local- and non-local-potentials due to ((i)\nOne-boson-exchanges (OBE, which are the members of nonets of pseudoscalar ,\nvector, scalar, and axial-vector mesons, (ii) diffractive (i.e. multiple-gluon)\nexchanges, (iii) two pseudoscalar exchange (PS-PS), and (iv)\nmeson-pair-exchange (MPE). The OBE- and MPE-vertices are regulated by gaussian\nform factors producing potentials with a soft behavior near the origin.

We expand upon the Esquivel & Lazarian method to estimate the Alfven\nMach number using the structure function anisotropy in velocity centroid data\nfrom position-position-velocity maps. We utilize 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulations of fully developed turbulence, with a large range of sonic and\nAlfvenic Mach numbers, to produce synthetic observations of velocity centroids\nwith observational characteristics such as thermal broadening, cloud\nboundaries, noise, and radiative transfer effects of carbon monoxide.

We find that the degree of\nanisotropy is related primarily to the magnetic field strength (i.e. Alfven\nMach number) and the line-of-sight orientation, with a secondary effect on\nsonic Mach number. If the line-of-sight is parallel to up to ~45 deg off of the\nmean field direction, the velocity centroid anisotropy is not prominent enough\nto distinguish different Alfvenic regimes.

Combining the\nidea of punch card programming with arbitrary fluid control, here we describe a\nself-contained, hand-crank powered, multiplex and robust programmable\nmicrofluidic platform. A paper tape encodes information as a series of punched\nholes.

This property, called {\\em equitability}, is important for\nanalyzing high-dimensional data sets.\n  Here we formalize the theory behind both equitability and MIC in the language\nof estimation theory. This formalization has a number of advantages. First, it\nallows us to show that equitability is a generalization of power against\nstatistical independence. Second, it allows us to compute and discuss the\npopulation value of MIC, which we call MIC_*. In doing so we generalize and\nstrengthen the mathematical results proven in Reshef et al. (2011) and clarify\nthe relationship between MIC and mutual information. Introducing MIC_* also\nenables us to reason about the properties of MIC more abstractly: for instance,\nwe show that MIC_* is continuous and that there is a sense in which it is a\ncanonical \"smoothing\" of mutual information. We also prove an alternate,\nequivalent characterization of MIC_* that we use to state new estimators of it\nas well as an algorithm for explicitly computing it when the joint probability\ndensity function of a pair of random variables is known. Our hope is that this\npaper provides a richer theoretical foundation for MIC and equitability going\nforward.\n  This paper will be accompanied by a forthcoming companion paper that performs\nextensive empirical analysis and comparison to other methods and discusses the\npractical aspects of both equitability and the use of MIC and its related\nstatistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 08:17:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 19:08:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 May 2015 19:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

These atmospheric parameters are commonly\nmeasured in most observatories by different methods located away from the\ntelescope platform, and thus differing from the effective estimates at the\nfocus of a telescope, mainly because of differences in pointing orientation,\nheight above the ground, or local seeing bias (dome contribution).

In particular we focus on\nthe question how boron is embedded into the local structure of the silicate\nnetwork liquid. From the partial structure factors we conclude that there is a\nweak nanoscale phase separation between silicon and boron and that the sodium\natoms form channel-like structures as they have been found in previous studies\nof sodo-silicate glass-formers. Our results for the X-ray and neutron structure\nfactor show that this feature is basically unnoticeable in the former but\nshould be visible in the latter as a small peak at small wave-vectors. At high\ntemperatures we find a high concentration of three-fold coordinated boron atoms\nwhich decreases rapidly with decreasing T, whereas the number of four-fold\ncoordinated boron atoms increases. Therefore we conclude that at the\nexperimental glass transition temperature most boron atoms will be four-fold\ncoordinated. We show that the transformation of [3]B into [4]B with decreasing\nT is not just related to the diminution of non-bridging oxygen atoms as claimed\nin previous studies, but to a restructuration of the silicate matrix. The\ndiffusion constants of the various elements show an Arrhenius behavior and we\nfind that the one for boron has the same value as the one of oxygen and is\nsignificantly larger than the one of silicon. This shows that these two network\nformers have rather different dynamical properties, a result that is also\nconfirmed from the time dependence of the van Hove functions.

A recurring feature of\nthese outflows is their broad ionization distribution, including essentially\nall ionization levels (e.g., Fe^0+ to Fe^25+). This characteristic feature can\nbe quantified with the absorption measure distribution (AMD), defined as the\ndistribution of column density with ionization parameter |dN / dlog xi|.\nObserved AMDs extend over 0.1 < xi < 10^4 (cgs), and are remarkably similar in\ndifferent objects. Power-law fits (|dN /dlog xi| ~ N_1 xi^a) yield N_1 =\n3x10^{21} cm^-2 +- 0.4 dex and a = 0 -- 0.4. What is the source of this broad\nionization distribution, and what sets the small range of observed $N_1$ and\n$a$? A common interpretation is a multiphase outflow, with a wide range of gas\ndensities in a uniform gas pressure medium. However, the incident radiation\npressure leads to a gas pressure gradient in the photoionized gas, and\ntherefore to a broad range of ionization states within a single slab. We show\nthat this compression of the gas by the radiation pressure leads to an AMD with\n|dN / dlog xi| = 8x10^21 xi^0.03 cm^-2, remarkably similar to that observed.\nThe calculated values of $N_1$ and $a$ depend weakly on the gas metallicity,\nthe ionizing spectral slope, the distance from the nucleus, the ambient\ndensity, and the total absorber column.

The suggestion that the outflow is shielded from the ionizing\nradiation was excluded by recent observations. The remaining solution is a\ndense outflow with a filling factor $f<10^{-3}$.

Finally the orientifold equivalence is shown to hold at\nthe level of the equation of state and its accuracy at $N=3$ is shown to be\nvery good.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 12:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-22"}

Open systems allow information to be exchanged between the\ndegrees of freedom of interest and those that are integrated out, such as for\nparticles moving through a fluid. Strictly speaking they cannot in general be\ndescribed by an effective lagrangian; rather the appropriate `low-energy' limit\nis instead a Lindblad equation describing the evolution of the density matrix\nof the slow degrees of freedom. We derive the equation relevant to super-Hubble\nmodes of quantum fields in near-de Sitter spacetimes and derive two\nimplications. We show the evolution of the diagonal density-matrix elements\nquickly approaches the Fokker-Planck equation of Starobinsky's stochastic\ninflationary picture. This provides an alternative first-principles derivation\nof this picture's stochastic noise and drift, as well as its leading\ncorrections. (An application computes the noise for systems with a sub-luminal\nsound speed.) We argue that the presence of interactions drives the\noff-diagonal density-matrix elements to zero in the field basis. This shows why\nthe field basis is the `pointer basis' for the decoherence of primordial\nquantum fluctuations while they are outside the horizon, thus allowing them to\nre-enter as classical fluctuations, as assumed when analyzing CMB data. The\ndecoherence process is efficient, occurring after several Hubble times even for\ninteractions as weak as gravitational-strength. Crucially, the details of the\ninteractions largely control only the decoherence time and not the nature of\nthe final late-time stochastic state, much as interactions can control the\nequilibration time for thermal systems but are largely irrelevant to the\nproperties of the resulting equilibrium state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 13:34:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 16:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-01"}

In microrheology, the thermal motion of tracer particles embedded\nin a complex fluid is used to extract the fluid's viscoelastic properties.\nComparing the motion of a single particle to the correlated motion of particle\npairs, it is possible to extract viscoelastic properties at different length\nscales. In a recent study, a crossover between intermediate and bulk response\nof complex fluids was discovered in microrheology measurements of reconstituted\nactin networks. This crossover length was related to structural and mechanical\nproperties of the networks, such as their mesh size and dynamic correlation\nlength. Here we capitalize on this result giving a detailed description of our\nanalysis scheme, and demonstrating how this relation can be used to extract the\ndynamic correlation length of a polymer network. We further study the relation\nbetween the dynamic correlation length and the structure of the network, by\nintroducing a new length scale, the average filament length, without altering\nthe network's mesh size. Contrary to the prevailing assumption, that the\ndynamic correlation length is equivalent to the mesh size of the network, we\nfind that the dynamic correlation length increases once the filament length is\nreduced below the crossover distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 14:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-22"}

Our simulations successfully reproduce\ntwo observed types of young cavities elongated along either the jet ($\\tau>1$;\ntype-II) or perpendicular ($\\tau\\leq1$; type-I) direction. Bottom-wide type-I\ncavities are produced by very light internally-subsonic jets, while top-wide\ntype-II cavities are produced by heavier, internally-supersonic jets, which may\nalso produce center-wide cavities with $\\tau\\sim 1$ if the jets are only\nslightly supersonic. Bottom-wide type-II cavities can be produced by very light\njets with very long durations and cylindrical cavities are produced by very\nlight internally-supersonic jets. While not appreciably affecting the shapes of\nyoung cavities, viscosity significantly affects the long-term cavity evolution,\nsuppressing both interface instabilities and the formation of torus-like\nmorphology.

On dust\nsurfaces, water is the main constituent of the icy mantle in which a complex\nchemistry is taking place. We aim to study the formation pathways and the\ncomposition of the ices throughout the evolution of diffuse clouds. For this\npurpose, we use time-dependent rate equations to calculate the molecular\nabundances in both gas phase and on solid surfaces (onto dust grains). We fully\nconsider the gas-dust interplay by including the details of freeze-out,\nchemical and thermal desorption, as well as the most important photo-processes\non grain surfaces. The difference in binding energies of chemical species on\nbare and icy surfaces is also incorporated into our equations. Using the\nnumerical code FLASH, we perform a hydrodynamical simulation of a\ngravitationally bound diffuse cloud and follow its contraction. We find that\nwhile the dust grains are still bare, water formation is enhanced by grain\nsurface chemistry which is subsequently released into the gas phase, enriching\nthe molecular medium. The CO molecules, on the other hand, tend to freeze out\ngradually on bare grains. This causes CO to be well mixed and strongly present\nwithin the first ice layer. Once one monolayer of water ice has formed, the\nbinding energy of the grain surface changes significantly and an immediate and\nstrong depletion of gas-phase water and CO molecules occur. While hydrogenation\nconverts solid CO into formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH), water\nice becomes the main constituent of the icy grains. Inside molecular clumps\nformaldehyde is more abundant than water and methanol in the gas phase owing\nits presence in part to chemical desorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 15:05:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 16:06:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 12:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The former is the more physically\naccurate description, but the latter is frequently more amenable to analysis\nand computation. By the conservation of mass, the density is constant along the\nstreamlines of the flow; the stratification can therefore be specified by\nprescribing the value of the density on each streamline. We call this the\nstreamline density function.\n  Our main result states that, for every smoothly stratified periodic traveling\nwave in a certain small-amplitude regime, there is an $L^\\infty$ neighborhood\nof its streamline density function such that, for any piecewise smooth\nstreamline density function in that neighborhood, there is a corresponding\ntraveling wave solution. Moreover, the mapping from streamline density function\nto wave is Lipschitz continuous in a certain function space framework. As this\nneighborhood includes piecewise smooth densities with arbitrarily many jump\ndiscontinues, this theorem provides a rigorous justification for the ubiquitous\npractice of approximating a smoothly stratified wave by a layered one. We also\ndiscuss some applications of this result to the study of the qualitative\nfeatures of such waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 15:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Furthermore, for embedded systems, low power\nconsumption should be generally considered together with high computing\nperformance. FPGAs, as programmable logic devices able to support different\ntypes of fine-grained parallelisms, their power and performance advantages were\nrecognized widely. However, designing applications on FPGA-based systems is\ntraditionally far from a task can be carried out by software programmers.\nGenerally, hardware engineers and even system-level software engineers have\nmore hardware/architectural knowledge but fewer algorithm and application\nknowledge. Thus, it is critical for computing systems to allow\napplication-level programmers to realize their idea conveniently, which is\npopular in computing systems based on the general processor. In this paper, the\nOpenHEC (Open Framework for High-Efficiency Computing) framework is proposed to\nprovide a design framework for application-level software programmers to use\nFPGA-based platforms. It frees users from hardware and architectural details to\nlet them focus more on algorithms/applications. This framework was integrated\nwith the commercial Xilinx ISE/Vivado to make it to be used immediately. After\nimplementing a widely-used feature detection algorithm on OpenHEC from the\nperspective of software programmers, it shows this framework is applicable for\napplication programmers with little hardware knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 11:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-25"}

For a closed system, the excited state\ncoherence induced by the sunlight oscillates with an average amplitude that is\ninversely proportional to the excitonic gap, and reaches a stationary amplitude\nthat depends on the temperature and coherence time of the radiation field. For\nan open system, the light-induced dynamical coherence relaxes to a static\ncoherence determined by the non-canonical thermal distribution resulting from\nthe entanglement with the phonon bath. The decay of the excited state\npopulation to the common ground state establishes a non-equilibrium\nsteady-state flux driven by the sunlight, and it defines a time window to\nobserve the transition from dynamical to static coherence. For the parameters\nrelevant to photosynthetic systems, the exciton dynamics initiated by the\nsunlight exhibits a non-negligible amount of dynamical coherence (quantum\nbeats) on the sub-picosecond timescale; however, this sub-picosecond time-scale\nis long enough for light-harvesting systems to establish static coherence,\nwhich plays a crucial role in efficient energy transfer. Further, a\nrelationship is established between the non-equilibrium steady-state induced by\nthe sunlight and the coherent dynamics initiated from the ground state by a\nlaser $\\delta$-pulse, thereby making a direct connection between incoherent\nsunlight excitation and ultrafast spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Aug 2014 07:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-25"}

There is already a significant body of literature that has made key\ninroads into understanding human mobility using this exciting new data source,\nand there have been several different measures of mobility used.

High-level synthesis (HLS) raises the design abstraction from\nHDL to languages such as C/C++/Scala/Java. Despite this, in order to get a good\nquality of result (QoR), a designer must carefully craft the HLS code. In other\nwords, HLS designers must implement the application using an abstract language\nin a manner that generates an efficient micro-architecture; we call this\nprocess writing restructured code. This reduces the benefits of implementing\nthe application at a higher level of abstraction and limits the impact of HLS\nby requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying hardware architecture.\nDevelopers must know how to write code that reflects low level implementation\ndetails of the application at hand as it is interpreted by HLS tools.
