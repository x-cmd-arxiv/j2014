The number of retractions each year has also\nincreased tremendously, especially in the biomedical field, and scientific\nmisconduct accounts for approximately more than half of those retractions. It\nis assumed that co-authors of retracted papers are affected by their\ncolleagues' misconduct, and the aim of this study is to provide empirical\nevidence of the effect of retractions in biomedical research on co-authors'\nresearch careers. Using data from the Web of Science (WOS), we measured the\nproductivity, impact and collaboration of 1,123 co-authors of 293 retracted\narticles for a period of five years before and after the retraction. We found\nclear evidence that collaborators do suffer consequences of their colleagues'\nmisconduct, and that a retraction for fraud has higher consequences than a\nretraction for error. Our results also suggest that the extent of these\nconsequences is closely linked with the ranking of co-authors on the retracted\npaper, being felt most strongly by first authors, followed by the last authors,\nwhile the impact is less important for middle authors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Aug 2014 16:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-25"}

A desirable control scheme\nshould strike the right balance between efficiency (operating at a high service\nrate) and parallelism (preventing small jobs from getting stuck behind large\nones).\n  We employ the framework of heavy-traffic diffusion analysis to devise near\noptimal control heuristics for such a queueing system. However, while the\nliterature on diffusion control of state-dependent queueing systems begins with\na sequence of systems and an exogenously defined drift function, we begin with\na finite discrete PS server and propose an axiomatic recipe to explicitly\nconstruct a sequence of state-dependent PS servers which then yields a drift\nfunction.

Of the variations in the figure axis\narising from different causes, the variation owing to the Earth's geophysical\ncauses is determined from polar motion data. Equations that give the relation\nbetween the figure axis and rotational axis are derived and the motion of the\nfigure pole with respect to the Earth's surface or the figure axis in the Earth\nis determined by using these equations. Estimation of error suggests that the\naccuracy of the determination for the position of the figure pole at each\nmoment is sufficiently good and that even a variation that occurs during a\nshort duration of time, such as one or two days, is significant. The determined\nposition of the figure pole exhibits a rapid and complicated motion in a short\nduration.

Focusing on the low-storage\nregime, where the amount of stored patterns grows at most logarithmical with\nthe system size, we prove that these non-mean-field Hopfield-like networks\ndisplay a richer phase diagram than their classical counterparts. In\nparticular, these networks are able to perform serial processing (i.e. retrieve\none pattern at a time through a complete rearrangement of the whole ensemble of\nneurons) as well as parallel processing (i.e. retrieve several patterns\nsimultaneously, delegating the management of diff erent patterns to diverse\ncommunities that build network). The tune between the two regimes is given by\nthe rate of the coupling decay and by the level of noise affecting the system.\nThe price to pay for those remarkable capabilities lies in a network's capacity\nsmaller than the mean field counterpart, thus yielding a new budget principle:\nthe wider the multitasking capabilities, the lower the network load and\nviceversa. This may have important implications in our understanding of\nbiological complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Aug 2014 15:18:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 11:52:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

We find that even with\nidentical numerical prescriptions for calculating the rotational mixing\ncoefficients in the diffusion equation, different timesteps lead to a deviation\nof the coefficients and hence surface abundances. We find the surface\nabundances vary by 10-100% between the model sequences with short timestep of\n0.001Myr to model sequences with longer timesteps. Model sequences with\nstronger surface nitrogen enrichment also have longer main-sequence lifetimes\nbecause more hydrogen is mixed to the burning cores. The deviations in\nmain-sequence lifetimes can be as large as 20%. Mathematically speaking, no\nnumerical scheme can give a perfect solution unless infinitesimally small\ntimesteps are used. However, we find that the surface abundances eventually\nconverge within 10% between modelling sequences with sufficiently small\ntimesteps below 0.1Myr. The efficiency of rotational mixing depends on the\nimplemented numerical scheme and critically on the computation of the mean\nmolecular weight gradient. A smoothing function for the mean molecular weight\ngradient results in stronger rotational mixing. If the discretization scheme or\nthe computational recipe for calculating the mean molecular weight gradient is\naltered, re-calibration of mixing parameters may be required to fit\nobservations. If we are to properly understand the fundamental physics of\nrotation in stars, it is crucial that we minimize the uncertainty introduced\ninto stellar evolution models when numerically approximating rotational mixing\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Aug 2014 15:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}

The different choices for inner products on the space of\nprobability distributions result in different Fokker-Planck equations for the\nsame process. Each of these Fokker-Planck equations has a unique global\nequilibrium, which is a Gibbs distribution.
