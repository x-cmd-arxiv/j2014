The opportunity\nto communicate with on a one-to-one basis is highly valued. However with many\nhundreds of applications each year, one-to-one conversations are not feasible\nin most cases. The communication will require a member of academic staff to\nexpend several hours to find suitable answers and contact each student. It\nwould be useful to reduce his costs and time.\n  The project aims to reduce the burden on the head of admissions, and\npotentially other users, by developing a convincing chatbot. A suitable\nalgorithm must be devised to search through the set of data and find a\npotential answer. The program then replies to the user and provides a relevant\nweb link if the user is not satisfied by the answer. Furthermore a web\ninterface is provided for both users and an administrator.\n  The achievements of the project can be summarised as follows. To prepare the\nbackground of the project a literature review was undertaken, together with an\ninvestigation of existing tools, and consultation with the head of admissions.\nThe requirements of the system were established and a range of algorithms and\ntools were investigated, including keyword and template matching. An algorithm\nthat combines keyword matching with string similarity has been developed. A\nusable system using the proposed algorithm has been implemented. The system was\nevaluated by keeping logs of questions and answers and by feedback received by\npotential students that used it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 16:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-29"}

This low temperature crossover from Mott to\nES VRH indicates the presence of a Coulomb gap (~3 meV). Our results\ndemonstrate the competing and tunable conduction in Sr2IrO4 thin films, which\nin turn would be helpful for understanding the insulating nature related to\nstrong spin-orbit-coupling of the 5d iridates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 18:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-29"}

Most\nprior work has focused on efficiently computing upper bounds for the induced L2\nnorm. The conditions for upper bounds are typically based on scaled small-gain\ntheorems with dynamic multipliers or dissipation inequalities with parameter\ndependent Lyapunov functions. This paper presents a complementary algorithm to\ncompute lower bounds for the induced L2 norm. The proposed approach computes a\nlower bound on the gain by restricting the parameter trajectory to be a\nperiodic signal. This restriction enables the use of recent results for exact\ncalculation of the L2 norm for a periodic linear time varying system. The\nproposed lower bound algorithm has two benefits. First, the lower bound\ncomplements standard upper bound techniques. Specifically, a small gap between\nthe bounds indicates that further computation, e.g. upper bounds with more\ncomplex Lyapunov functions, is unnecessary. Second, the lower bound algorithm\nreturns a bad parameter trajectory for the LPV system that can be further\nanalyzed to provide insight into the system performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 18:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-29"}

Two major parameters are considered for the\nstudy: the central velocity dispersion (sigma), which relates to local drivers\nof star formation, and the mass of the host halo, which relates to\nenvironment-related effects. In addition, we separate the sample between\ncentrals (the most massive galaxy in a halo) and satellites. We derive trends\nof age, metallicity, and [alpha/Fe] enhancement, with sigma.

No environmental dependence is detected for satellite\nETGs, except at low sigma - where satellites in groups or in the outskirts of\nclusters tend to be younger than those in the central regions of clusters. In\ncontrast, the trends for centrals show a significant dependence on halo mass.\nCentral ETGs in groups (i.e. with a halo mass >10^12.5 M_Sun) have younger\nages, lower [alpha/Fe], and higher internal reddening, than \"isolated\" systems\n(i.e. centrals residing in low-mass, <10^12.5 M_Sun, halos). Our findings imply\nthat central ETGs in groups formed their stellar component over longer time\nscales than \"isolated\" centrals, mainly because of gas-rich interactions with\ntheir companion galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 19:25:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Thus the interplay\nbetween positive and negative relationships in such networks has become an\nimportant research topic. Most recent investigations focus upon edge sign\ninference using structural balance theory or social status theory. Neither of\nthese two theories, however, can explain an observed edge sign well when the\ntwo nodes connected by this edge do not share a common neighbor (e.g., common\nfriend). In this paper we develop a novel approach to handle this situation by\napplying a new model for node types. Initially, we analyze the local node\nstructure in a fully observed signed directed network, inferring underlying\nnode types. The sign of an edge between two nodes must be consistent with their\ntypes; this explains edge signs well even when there are no common neighbors.\nWe show, moreover, that our approach can be extended to incorporate directed\ntriads, when they exist, just as in models based upon structural balance or\nsocial status theory. We compute Bayesian node types within empirical studies\nbased upon partially observed Wikipedia, Slashdot, and Epinions networks in\nwhich the largest network (Epinions) has 119K nodes and 841K edges.

Current stochastic background searches assume\nthat pulsars in a PTA are separated from each other and the Earth by many GW\nwavelengths. As more millisecond pulsars are discovered and added to PTAs, some\nmay be separated by only a few radiation wavelengths or less, resulting in\ncorrelated GW phase changes between close pulsars in the array. Here we\ninvestigate how PTA overlap reduction functions (ORFs), up to quadrupole order,\nare affected by these additional correlated phase changes, and how they are in\nturn affected by relaxing the assumption that all pulsars are equidistant from\nthe solar system barycenter. We find that in the low frequency GW background\nlimit of $f\\sim10^{-9}$~Hz, and for pulsars at varying distances from the\nEarth, that these additional correlations only affect the ORFs by a few percent\nfor pulsar pairs at large angular separations, as expected. However when nearby\n(order 100 pc) pulsars are separated by less than a few degrees, the correlated\nphase changes can introduce variations of a few tens of percent in the\nmagnitude of the isotropic ORF, and much larger fractional differences in the\nanisotropic ORFs-- up to 188 in the $m=0$, $l=2$ ORF for equidistant pulsars\nseparated by 3 degrees. In fact, the magnitude of most of the anisotropic ORFs\nis largest at small, but non-zero, pulsar separations.

It is argued that it is in the spirit of\nthe semiclassical wave function formalism to make necessary rationalization of\nrespective quantities accompanied the procedure of the semiclassical\nquantization in polygon billiards. Unfolding rational polygon billiards (RPB)\ninto corresponding Riemann surfaces (RS) periodic structures of the latter are\ndemonstrated with 2g independent periods on the respective multitori with g as\ntheir genuses. However it is the two dimensional real space of the real linear\ncombinations of these periods which is used for quantizing RPB. A class of\ndoubly rational polygon billiards (DRPB) is distinguished for which these real\nlinear relations are rational and their semiclassical quantization by wave\nfunction formalism is presented. It is shown that semiclassical quantization of\nboth the classical momenta and the energy spectra are determined completely by\nperiodic structure of the corresponding RS. Each RS is then reduced to\nelementary polygon patterns (EPP) as its basic periodic elements. Each such EPP\ncan be glued to a torus of genus g.

When edge carbon atoms are\nsubstituted with boron atoms to suppress the edge magnetization in one of the\nelectrodes, we obtain a diode with current rectification ratio over 10e6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 02:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-01"}

A variety of\ncrowdsourced queries have been investigated. In this paper, we focus on the\ncrowdsourced join query which aims to utilize humans to find all pairs of\nmatching objects from two collections. As a human-only solution is expensive,\nwe adopt a hybrid human-machine approach which first uses machines to generate\na candidate set of matching pairs, and then asks humans to label the pairs in\nthe candidate set as either matching or non-matching. Given the candidate\npairs, existing approaches will publish all pairs for verification to a\ncrowdsourcing platform. However, they neglect the fact that the pairs satisfy\ntransitive relations. As an example, if $o_1$ matches with $o_2$, and $o_2$\nmatches with $o_3$, then we can deduce that $o_1$ matches with $o_3$ without\nneeding to crowdsource $(o_1, o_3)$. To this end, we study how to leverage\ntransitive relations for crowdsourced joins. We propose a hybrid\ntransitive-relations and crowdsourcing labeling framework which aims to\ncrowdsource the minimum number of pairs to label all the candidate pairs. We\nprove the optimal labeling order in an ideal setting and propose a heuristic\nlabeling order in practice. We devise a parallel labeling algorithm to\nefficiently crowdsource the pairs following the order.

This paper presents a simple, robust and efficient\nalgorithm that can be applied for pricing many exotic options by computing the\nexpectations using Gauss-Hermite integration quadrature applied on a cubic\nspline interpolation. The algorithm is fully explicit but does not suffer the\ninherent instability of the explicit finite difference counterpart. A `free'\nbonus of the algorithm is that it already contains the function for fast and\naccurate interpolation of multiple solutions required by many discretely\nmonitored path dependent options.

We found that the two optimal-filter\nluminosities extract virial information (size and virial velocity of the broad\nline region, BLR) from the spectra, justifying their usage in this empirical BH\nmass estimator. The major advantages of this new recipe over traditional SE BH\nmass estimators utilizing continuum luminosity and broad line width are: 1) it\nhas a smaller intrinsic scatter of 0.28 dex calibrated against RM masses; 2) it\nis extremely simple to use in practice, without any need to decompose the\nspectrum; 3) it produces unambiguous and highly repeatable results even with\nlow signal-to-noise spectra. The combination of the two luminosities can also\ncancel out, to some extent, systematic luminosity errors potentially introduced\nby uncertainties in distance or flux calibration. In addition, we recalibrated\nthe traditional SE mass estimators using broad Hbeta full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) and monochromatic continuum luminosity at 5100A (L_5100). We found that\nusing the best-fit slopes on FWHM and L_5100 (derived from fitting the BLR\nradius-luminosity relation and the correlation between rms line dispersion and\nSE FWHM, respectively) rather than simple assumptions (e.g., 0.5 for L_5100 and\n2 for FWHM) leads to more precise SE mass estimates, improving the intrinsic\nscatter from 0.41 dex to 0.36 dex with respect to the RM masses. We compared\ndifferent estimators and discussed their applications to the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) quasar sample.

In this paper, we aim to understand know how to allocate\nthe limited recovery resources to efficiently prevent the spreading of\nepidemics. We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model\non directed scale-free networks. In the classic SIS model, a susceptible node\ncan be infected by an infected neighbor with the infection rate $\\beta$ and an\ninfected node can be recovered to be susceptible again with the recovery rate\n$\\delta$. In the steady state a fraction $y_\\infty$ of nodes are infected,\nwhich shows how severely the network is infected. We propose to allocate the\nrecovery rate $\\delta_i$ for node $i$ according to its indegree and\noutdegree-$\\delta_i\\scriptsize{\\sim}k_{i,in}^{\\alpha_{in}}k_{i,out}^{\\alpha_{out}}$,\ngiven the finite average recovery rate $\\langle\\delta\\rangle$ representing the\nlimited recovery resources over the whole network.

Here, we introduce a framework to\ninvestigate the structural stability of socioeconomic systems formed by the\nnetwork of interactions among agents competing for resources. We measure the\nstructural stability of the system as the range of conditions in the\ndistribution and availability of resources compatible with the qualitative\nbehavior in which all the constituent agents can be self-sustained across time.\nTo illustrate our framework, we study an empirical representation of the global\nsocioeconomic system formed by countries sharing and competing for\nmultinational companies used as proxy for resources. We demonstrate that the\nstructural stability of the system is inversely associated with the level of\ncompetition and the level of heterogeneity in the distribution of resources.\nImportantly, we show that the qualitative behavior of the observed global\nsocioeconomic system is highly sensitive to changes in the distribution of\nresources.

Spin\nconfigurations of the PM phase are approximated using a binary special\nquasi-random structure (SQS) with a supercell approach. The behavior of phonon\nmodes can be associated with pressure-induced phase transitions to the\nface-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structures as\nfollows: For the PM phase, it is found that the low-frequency transverse mode\nat the N point (N$_4^-$ mode), which corresponds to a bcc-hcp phase transition\npathway, exhibits strong softening under isotropic volume compression. The\nfrequency of this mode becomes zero by $2\\%$ volume decrease within the\nharmonic approximation. This result is not consistent with the experimental\nfact that phase transition from the PM bcc to hcp phases does not occur under\nvolume compression. The seeming contradiction can be explained only when\nanharmonic behavior of the N$_4^-$ mode is taken into consideration; a\npotential energy curve along the N$_4^-$ mode becomes closer to a double-well\nshape for the PM phase under the volume compression. On the other hand,\nsoftening of the longitudinal mode at the 2/3[111] point under the volume\ncompression is also found for the PM phase, which indicates the\npressure-induced bcc-fcc phase transition along this mode. Such behaviors are\nnot seen in ferromagnetic (FM) bcc Fe, implying that the magnetic structure\nplays essential roles on the phase transition mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 11:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The simulations incorporate type I\nmigration (including corotation torques and their saturation), gap formation,\ntype II migration, gas accretion onto planetary cores, and gas disc dispersal\nthrough photoevaporation. The aim is to examine whether or not the oligarchic\ngrowth scenario, when combined with self-consistent disc models and up-to-date\nprescriptions for disc-driven migration, can produce planetary systems similar\nto those that have been observed.\n  The results correlate with the initial disc mass. Low mass discs form\nclose-packed systems of terrestrial-mass planets and super-Earths. Higher mass\ndiscs form multiple generations of planets, with masses in the range 10 < mp <\n45M_Earth. These planets generally type I migrate into the inner disc, because\nof corotation torque saturation, where they open gaps and type II migrate into\nthe central star. Occasionally, a final generation of low-to-intermediate mass\nplanets forms and survives due to gas disc dispersal. No surviving gas giants\nwere formed in our simulations. Analysis shows that these planets can only\nsurvive migration if a core forms and experiences runaway gas accretion at\norbital radii r > 10 au prior to the onset of type II migration.\n  We conclude that planet growth above masses mp > 10M_Earth during the gas\ndisc life time leads to corotation torque saturation and rapid inward\nmigration, preventing the formation and survival of gas giants. This result is\nin contrast to the success in forming gas giant planets displayed by some\npopulation synthesis models. This discrepancy arises, in part, because the type\nII migration prescription adopted in the population synthesis models causes too\nlarge a reduction in the migration speed when in the planet dominated regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 12:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

TrES-2 is one\nof few exoplanets, which offer the matchless possibility to combine long-term\nground-based observations with continuous satellite data. Our research aimed at\nthe search for TTVs that would be indicative of perturbations from additional\nbodies in the system. We also wanted to refine the system parameters and the\norbital elements. We obtained 44 ground-based light curves of 31 individual\ntransit events of TrES-2. Eight 0.2 - 2.2-m telescopes located at six\nobservatories in Germany, Poland and Spain were used. In addition, we analysed\n18 quarters (Q0-Q17) of observational data from NASA's space telescope Kepler\nincluding 435 individual transit events and 11 publicly available ground-based\nlight curves. Assuming different limb darkening (LD) laws we performed an\nanalysis for all light curves and redetermined the parameters of the system. We\nalso carried out a joint analysis of the ground- and space-based data. The long\nobservation period of seven years (2007-2013) allowed a very precise\nredetermination of the transit ephemeris. For a total of 490 transit light\ncurves of TrES-2, the time of transit mid-point was determined. The transit\ntimes support neither variations on long time-scale nor on short time-scales.\nThe nearly continuous observations of Kepler show no statistically significant\nincrease or decrease in the orbital inclination i and the transit duration D.\nOnly the transit depth shows a slight increase which could be an indication of\nan increasing stellar activity. In general, system parameters obtained by us\nwere found to be in agreement with previous studies but are the most precise\nvalues to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 14:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-01"}

The recent\navailability of high-resolution contact networks in school environments\nprovides an opportunity to design micro-interventions and compare the outcomes\nof alternative mitigation measures. We consider mitigation measures that\ninvolve the targeted closure of school classes or grades based on readily\navailable information such as the number of symptomatic infectious children in\na class. We focus on the case of a primary school for which we have\nhigh-resolution data on the close-range interactions of children and teachers.\nWe simulate the spread of an influenza-like illness in this population by using\nan SEIR model with asymptomatics and compare the outcomes of different\nmitigation strategies. We find that targeted class closure affords strong\nmitigation effects: closing a class for a fixed period of time -equal to the\nsum of the average infectious and latent durations- whenever two infectious\nindividuals are detected in that class decreases the attack rate by almost 70%\nand strongly decreases the probability of a severe outbreak. The closure of all\nclasses of the same grade mitigates the spread almost as much as closing the\nwhole school. Targeted class closure strategies based on readily available\ninformation on symptomatic subjects and on limited information on mixing\npatterns, such as the grade structure of the school, can be almost as effective\nas whole-school closure, at a much lower cost.

The second wall is: (i) purely repulsive and therefore\ncompletely dry (contact angle 180 degrees) or (ii) weakly attractive and\npartially dry (the contact angle is typically in the range 160-170 degrees). At\nlow temperatures, but above the bulk triple point, we find using classical\ndensity functional theory (DFT) that the fluid is highly structured in the\nliquid part of the density profile. In case (i) a sequence of layering\ntransitions occurs: as L is increased at fixed chemical potential (mu) close to\nbulk gas--liquid coexistence, new layers of liquid-like density develop\ndiscontinuously. In contrast to confinement between identical walls, the\nsolvation force is repulsive for all wall separations and jumps discontinuously\nat each layering transition and the excess grand potential exhibits many\nmetastable minima as a function of the adsorption. For a fixed temperature\nT=0.56Tc, where Tc is the bulk critical temperature, we determine the\ntransition lines in the L, mu plane. In case (ii) we do not find layering\ntransitions and the solvation force oscillates about zero. We discuss how our\nmean-field DFT results might be altered by including effects of fluctuations\nand comment on how the phenomenology we have revealed might be relevant for\nexperimental and simulation studies of water confined between hydrophilic and\nhydrophobic substrates, emphasizing it is important to distinguish between\ncases (i) and (ii).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 15:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-01"}

The computational costs and accuracy\nof ET-AIM are compared to its time-domain counterpart, the time-domain adaptive\nintegral method (TD-AIM), in the high-frequency regime, where the spatial\ndiscretization of the scattering object is determined by the minimum wavelength\nof interest rather than its geometrical features. Numerical results show that\nalthough ET-AIM and TD-AIM computation times are comparable when the bandwidth\nof interest is wide, the ET-AIM marching costs are dominated by iterative\nsolution rather than scattered-field computations ('right-hand-side'\ncomputations) and that as the bandwidth of interest becomes narrower than 50%\nof the center frequency, ET-AIM computational costs become significantly\nsmaller than TD-AIM ones. ET-AIM is also shown to efficiently solve large and\ncomplex scattering problems whose solution by TD-AIM is impractical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 15:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-01"}
