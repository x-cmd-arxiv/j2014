Fundamentally, these\nexcitations are associated with an attractive interaction between elementary\nspin-excitations (i.e., magnons) and were predicted to occur in PMA materials\nin the absence of damping [1,2]. While damping, present in all magnetic\nmaterials, suppresses these excitations, it is now possible to compensate\ndamping by spin transfer torques through electrical current flow in nanometer\nscale contacts to ferromagnetic thin films [3,4]. A theory predicts the\nappearance of magnetic droplet solitons at a threshold current in nanocontacts\n[5] and, recently, experimental signatures of droplet nucleation have been\nreported [6]. However, thus far, they have been observed to be nearly\nreversible excitations, with only partially reversed magnetization and to be\nsubject to instabilities that cause them to drift away from the nanocontacts\n(i.e., drift instabilities) [6]. Here we show that magnetic droplet solitons\ncan be stabilized in a spin transfer nanocontact. Further, they exhibit a\nstrong hysteretic response to fields and currents and a nearly fully reversed\nmagnetization in the contact. These observations, in addition to their\nfundamental interest, open up new applications for magnetic droplet solitons as\nmulti-state high frequency current and field tunable oscillators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 16:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

According\nto this hypothesis, collective vigilance allows prey in large groups to detect\npredators more efficiently by making alarm signals or behavioral cues to each\nother, thereby allowing individuals within the group to spend more time\nforaging. Here, we find that collective vigilance is sufficient to select for\ngregarious foraging behavior as long there is not a direct cost for grouping\n(e.g., competition for limited food resources), even when controlling for\nconfounding factors such as the dilution effect.

Learning to get by without an arm\nor hand can be very challenging, and existing prostheses do not yet fulfil the\nneeds of individuals with amputations. One promising solution is to provide\ngreater communication between a prosthesis and its user. Towards this end, we\npresent a simple machine learning interface to supplement the control of a\nrobotic limb with feedback to the user about what the limb will be experiencing\nin the near future. A real-time prediction learner was implemented to predict\nimpact-related electrical load experienced by a robot limb; the learning\nsystem's predictions were then communicated to the device's user to aid in\ntheir interactions with a workspace. We tested this system with five\nable-bodied subjects. Each subject manipulated the robot arm while receiving\ndifferent forms of vibrotactile feedback regarding the arm's contact with its\nworkspace. Our trials showed that communicable predictions could be learned\nquickly during human control of the robot arm. Using these predictions as a\nbasis for feedback led to a statistically significant improvement in task\nperformance when compared to purely reactive feedback from the device. Our\nstudy therefore contributes initial evidence that prediction learning and\nmachine intelligence can benefit not just control, but also feedback from an\nartificial limb.

CBP is a transcriptional\nco-activator for CREB, and induction of CREB-dependent transcription plays a\nkey role in long-term memory (LTM).

It is the first such implementation for\nwhich an upper bound on amortized time complexity has been proved. In our\nimplementation, operations access the list via cursors. Each cursor is\nassociated with an item in the list and is local to a process. The\nimplementation supports two update operations, insertBefore and delete, and two\nmove operations, moveRight and moveLeft. An insertBefore(c, x) operation\ninserts an item x into the list immediately before the cursor c's location. A\ndelete(c) operation removes the item at the cursor c's location and sets the\ncursor to the next item in the list. The move operations move the cursor one\nposition to the right or left. The update operations use single-word\nCompare&Swap instructions. The move operations only read shared memory and\nnever change the state of the data structure. If all update operations modify\ndifferent parts of the list, they run completely concurrently. Let cp(op) be\nthe maximum number of active cursors at any one time during the operation op.\nThe amortized complexity of each update operation op is O(cp(op)) and each move\noperation is O(1).

The goal is to estimate the source of waves from measurements of the\nacoustic pressure at a remote array of sensors. The waveguide effect is due to\nboundaries that trap the waves and guide them in a preferred (range) direction,\nthe waveguide axis, along which the medium is unbounded. The random waveguide\nis a model of perturbed ideal waveguides which have flat boundaries and are\nfilled with known media that do not change with range. The perturbation\nconsists of fluctuations of the boundary and of the wave speed due to numerous\nsmall inhomogeneities in the medium. The fluctuations are uncertain in\napplications, which is why we model them with random processes, and they cause\nsignificant cumulative scattering at long ranges from the source. The\nscattering effect manifests mathematically as an exponential decay of the\nexpectation of the acoustic pressure, the coherent part of the wave. The\nincoherent wave is modeled by the random fluctuations of the acoustic pressure,\nwhich dominate the expectation at long ranges from the source. We use the\nexisting theory of wave propagation in random waveguides to analyze the inverse\nproblem of estimating the source from incoherent wave recordings at remote\narrays. We show how to obtain from the incoherent measurements high fidelity\nestimates of the time resolved energy carried by the waveguide modes, and study\nthe invertibility of the system of transport equations that model energy\npropagation in order to estimate the source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 18:51:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Feb 2015 15:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-25"}

We are particularly\nconcerned by the time between these extreme events, called respectively waiting\ntime and quiet time. If the thresholds are high enough it is possible to\njustify the existence of scaling laws for the probability distribution of the\ntimes as a function of the threshold value, although the scaling functions are\ndifferent in each case. For point processes, in addition to the trivial Poisson\nprocess, one can obtain double-power-law distributions with no finite mean\nvalue. This is justified in the context of renormalization-group\ntransformations, where such distributions arise as limiting distributions after\niterations of the transformation. Clear connections with the generalized\ncentral limit theorem are established from here. The non-existence of finite\nmoments leads to a semi-parametric scaling law in terms of the sample mean\nwaiting time, in which the (usually unkown) scale parameter is eliminated but\nnot the exponents. In the case of time series, scaling can arise by considering\nrandom-walk-like signals with absorbing boundaries, resulting in distributions\nwith a power-law \"bulk\" and a faster decay for long times. For large thresholds\nthe moments of the quiet-time distribution show a power-law dependence with the\nscale parameter, and isolation of the latter and of the exponents leads to a\nnon-parametric scaling law in terms only of the moments of the distribution.\nConclusions about the projections of changes in the occurrence of natural\nhazards lead to the necessity of distinguishing the behavior of the mean of the\ndistribution with the behavior of the extreme events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 19:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Due to the partial filling of the\nlattice, the inter-site repulsive interaction is necessary to generate Mott\ninsulators, where electrons are localized in clusters, rather than at lattice\nsites. We provide examples of such cluster Mott insulators and study the phase\ntransitions between metallic states and cluster Mott insulators on an\nanisotropic Kagome lattice. It is shown that these cluster Mott insulators are\ngenerally U(1) quantum spin liquids with spinon Fermi surfaces.

For\nthe targets, we consider 2 different monodisperse grain-diameter sizes: 5 mm\nand 3 mm. The impact speed of the projectile is 11 m s$^{-1}$ directed\ndownward, perpendicular to the surface of the targets. Using an implementation\nof the soft-sphere discrete element method (SSDEM) in the $N$-Body gravity tree\ncode PKDGRAV, previously validated in the context of low-speed impacts into\nsintered glass bead agglomerates, we find a noticeable dependence of the amount\nof ejected mass on the projectile shape.

We then find that numerically the results are sensitive to the normal\ncoefficient of restitution of the grains, especially for impacts into targets\ncomprised of smaller grains (3 mm). We also find that static friction plays a\nmore important role for impacts into targets comprised of the larger grains.

A shared linguistic system provides people with the benefits of shared\nknowledge and coordinated planning. Once norms are in place, why would they\never change? This question, echoing broad questions in the theory of social\ndynamics, has particular force in relation to language. By definition, an\ninnovator is in the minority when the innovation first occurs. In some areas of\nsocial dynamics, important minorities can strongly influence the majority\nthrough their power, fame, or use of broadcast media. But most linguistic\nchanges are grassroots developments that originate with ordinary people. Here,\nwe develop a novel model of communicative behavior in communities, and identify\na mechanism for arbitrary innovations by ordinary people to have a good chance\nof being widely adopted.\n  To imitate each other, people must form a mental representation of what other\npeople do. Each time they speak, they must also decide which form to produce\nthemselves. We introduce a new decision function that enables us to smoothly\nexplore the space between two types of behavior: probability matching (matching\nthe probabilities of incoming experience) and regularization (producing some\nforms disproportionately often). Using Monte Carlo methods, we explore the\ninteractions amongst the degree of regularization, the distribution of biases\nin a network, and the network position of the innovator. We identify two\nregimes for the widespread adoption of arbritrary innovations, viewed as\ninformational cascades in the network. With moderate regularization of\nexperienced input, average people (not well-connected people) are the most\nlikely source of successful innovations. Our results shed light on a major\noutstanding puzzle in the theory of language change. The framework also holds\npromise for understanding the dynamics of other social norms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 21:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-12"}

However, a challenging\nsecrecy communication issue arises as the messages sent to the information\nreceivers (IRs) may be eavesdropped by the energy receivers (ERs), which are\npresumed to harvest energy only from the received signals. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose in this paper an artificial noise (AN) aided transmission\nscheme to facilitate the secrecy information transmission to IRs and yet meet\nthe energy harvesting requirement for ERs, under the assumption that the AN can\nbe cancelled at IRs but not at ERs. Specifically, the proposed scheme splits\nthe transmit power into two parts, to send the confidential message to the IR\nand an AN to interfere with the ER, respectively. Under a simplified three-node\nwiretap channel setup, the transmit power allocations and power splitting\nratios over fading channels are jointly optimized to minimize the outage\nprobability for delay-limited secrecy information transmission, or to maximize\nthe average rate for no-delay-limited secrecy information transmission, subject\nto a combination of average and peak power constraints at the transmitter as\nwell as an average energy harvesting constraint at the ER. Both the secrecy\noutage probability minimization and average rate maximization problems are\nshown to be non-convex, for each of which we propose the optimal solution based\non the dual decomposition as well as suboptimal solution based on the\nalternating optimization. Furthermore, two benchmark schemes are introduced for\ncomparison. Finally, the performances of proposed schemes are evaluated by\nsimulations in terms of various trade-offs for wireless (secrecy) information\nversus energy transmissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 21:27:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jan 2015 23:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-30"}

The\nlow-energy electronic structure of the heavily electron-doped AxFe2Se2 (A=K,\nRb, Cs) demonstrates that interband scattering or Fermi surface nesting is not\na necessary ingredient for the unconventional superconductivity in iron-based\nsuperconductors. The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) in the\none-unit-cell FeSe on SrTiO3 substrate can reach as high as ~65 K, largely\ntranscending the bulk Tc of all known iron-based superconductors. However, in\nthe case of AxFe2Se2, the inter-grown antiferromagnetic insulating phase makes\nit difficult to study the underlying physics. Superconductors of alkali metal\nions and NH3 molecules or organic-molecules intercalated FeSe and single layer\nor thin film FeSe on SrTiO3 substrate are extremely air-sensitive, which\nprevents the further investigation of their physical properties. Therefore, it\nis urgent to find a stable and accessible FeSe-derived superconductor for\nphysical property measurements so as to study the underlying mechanism of\nsuperconductivity.

The\nradiative transfer includes detailed treatment of scattering by atomic hydrogen\nand absorption by water of Lyman alpha photons, since the Lyman alpha line\ndominates the UV spectrum of accreting young stars. In a fiducial model, we\nfind that warm water vapor with temperature around 300 K is mainly distributed\nin a small and well-confined region in the inner disk. The inner boundary of\nthe warm water region is where the shielding of UV field due to dust and water\nitself become significant. The outer boundary is where the dust temperature\ndrops below the water condensation temperature. A more luminous central star\nleads to a more extended distribution of warm water vapor, while dust growth\nand settling tends to reduce the amount of warm water vapor. Based on typical\nassumptions regarding the elemental oxygen abundance and the water chemistry,\nthe column density of warm water vapor can be as high as 1E22 cm^{-2}. A small\namount of hot water vapor with temperature higher than ~300 K exists in a more\nextended region in the upper atmosphere of the disk. Cold water vapor with\ntemperature lower than 100 K is distributed over the entire disk, produced by\nphotodesorption of the water ice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 2014 05:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-12"}

Our main results for qualitative\npath constraint are as follows: (i) the problem of deciding the existence of a\nfinite-memory controller is EXPTIME-complete; and (ii) the problem of deciding\nthe existence of an infinite-memory controller is undecidable. For quantitative\npath constraint we show that the problem of deciding the existence of a\nfinite-memory controller is undecidable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 2014 05:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-12"}

For data volumes expected from future HI surveys\nwith upcoming facilities, this approach is not feasible any longer.\n  Aims. We describe the implementation of a fully automated source finding,\nparametrization, and classification pipeline for the Effelsberg-Bonn HI Survey\n(EBHIS). With future radio astronomical facilities in mind, we want to explore\nthe feasibility of a completely automated approach to source extraction for\nlarge-scale HI surveys.\n  Methods. Source finding is implemented using wavelet denoising methods, which\nprevious studies show to be a powerful tool, especially in the presence of data\ndefects. For parametrization, we automate baseline fitting, mask optimization,\nand other tasks based on well-established algorithms, currently used\ninteractively. For the classification of candidates, we implement an artificial\nneural network which is trained on a candidate set comprised of false positives\nfrom real data and simulated sources. Using simulated data, we perform a\nthorough analysis of the algorithms implemented.\n  Results. We compare the results from our simulations to the parametrization\naccuracy of the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS) survey. Even though HIPASS is\nmore sensitive than EBHIS in its current state, the parametrization accuracy\nand classification reliability match or surpass the manual approach used for\nHIPASS data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 2014 10:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

The high path loss of mmWave as well as\nphysical obstructions make communication challenging. To compensate for the\nsevere path loss, mmWave systems may employ a beam alignment algorithm that\nfacilitates highly directional transmission by aligning the beam direction of\nmultiple antenna arrays. This paper discusses a mmWave system employing\ndual-polarized antennas. First, we propose a practical soft-decision beam\nalignment (soft-alignment) algorithm that exploits orthogonal polarizations. By\nsounding the orthogonal polarizations in parallel, the equality criterion of\nthe Welch bound for training sequences is relaxed. Second, the analog\nbeamforming system is adapted to the directional characteristics of the mmWave\nlink assuming a high Ricean K-factor and poor scattering environment. The\nsoft-algorithm enables the mmWave system to align innumerable narrow beams to\nchannel subspace in an attempt to effectively scan the mmWave channel. Thirds,\nwe propose a method to efficiently adapt the number of channel sounding\nobservations to the specific channel environment based on an approximate\nprobability of beam misalignment. Simulation results show the proposed\nsoft-alignment algorithm with adaptive sounding time effectively scans the\nchannel subspace of a mobile user by exploiting polarization diversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 2014 13:49:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 16:08:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 May 2015 14:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-19"}

Analysis of kinetics on\nthis small set of hammerheads suggests that cleavage rate of computationally\ndesigned ribozymes may be correlated with positional entropy, ensemble defect,\nstructural flexibility/rigidity and related measures. Artificial ribozymes have\nbeen designed in the past either manually or by SELEX (Systematic Evolution of\nLigands by Exponential Enrichment); however, this appears to be the first\npurely computational design and experimental validation of novel functional\nribozymes. RNAiFold is available at\nhttp://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/RNAiFold/.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 2014 14:42:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-29"}

We are interested in the minimum \\emph{Connected Vertex\nCover} problem, a generalization of the classical minimum Vertex Cover problem,\nwhich allows to obtain a connected backbone. Recently, Delbot et\nal.~\\cite{DelbotLP13} proposed a new centralized algorithm with a constant\napproximation ratio of $2$ for this problem.

The new normalization rule thus\nsays that sum of probabilities over any orthonormal basis of directions is one.\nWe develop a probability calculus based on these more general distributions\nthat includes definitions of joints, conditionals and formulas that relate\nthese, i.e. analogs of the theorem of total probability, various Bayes rules\nfor the calculation of posterior density matrices, etc. The resulting calculus\nparallels the familiar 'classical' probability calculus and always retains the\nlatter as a special case when all matrices are diagonal.\n  Whereas the classical Bayesian methods maintain uncertainty about which model\nis 'best', the generalization maintains uncertainty about which unit direction\nhas the largest variance. Surprisingly the bounds also generalize: as in the\nclassical setting we bound the negative log likelihood of the data by the\nnegative log likelihood of the MAP estimator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 2014 05:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-14"}

A novel MUSIC based approach is proposed for estimating the direction\nof arrival of the interfering sources. The proposed method provides super\nresolution and asymptotic maximum likelihood estimates of the direction of\narrivals even at low SNR values. Simulations were performed using typical\nsatellite multi-beam antenna configurations and results show that the proposed\nscheme can effectively estimates the direction of arrival in the azimuth and\nelevation spectra. Compared to the support vector regression method, the\nproposed approach offer improved estimation accuracy at low SNR values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Aug 2014 05:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-02"}
