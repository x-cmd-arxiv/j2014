The set of\nlocalized basis functions over spatial $(L_1,L_2,L_3)$ lattice in a bounding\nbox (or supercell) is assembled by multiple replicas of those from the unit\ncell. All basis functions and operators are discretized on a global 3D tensor\ngrid in the bounding box which enables rather general basis sets. In the\nperiodic case, the Galerkin Fock matrix is shown to have the three-level block\ncirculant structure, that allows the FFT-based diagonalization. The proposed\ntensor techniques manifest the twofold benefits: (a) the entries of the Fock\nmatrix are computed by 1D operations using low-rank tensors represented on a 3D\ngrid, (b) the low-rank tensor structure in the diagonal blocks of the Fock\nmatrix in the Fourier space reduces the conventional 3D FFT to the product of\n1D FFTs. We describe fast numerical algorithms for the block circulant\nrepresentation of the core Hamiltonian in the periodic setting based on\nlow-rank tensor representation of arising multidimensional functions. Lattice\ntype systems in a box with open boundary conditions are treated by our previous\ntensor solver for single molecules, which makes possible calculations on large\n$(L_1,L_2,L_3)$ lattices due to reduced numerical cost for 3D problems. The\nnumerical simulations for box/periodic $(L,1,1)$ lattice systems in a 3D\nrectangular \"tube\" with $L$ up to several hundred confirm the theoretical\ncomplexity bounds for the tensor-structured eigenvalue solvers in the limit of\nlarge $L$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Aug 2014 17:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-19"}

However,\ndespite their relevance for predicting bulk properties of materials, there is\nno agreement on a quantitative description of force chains. Consequently, it is\ndifficult to compare the force-chain structures in different materials or\nexperimental conditions. To address this challenge, we treat granular materials\nas spatially-embedded networks in which the nodes (particles) are connected by\nweighted edges that represent contact forces. We use techniques from community\ndetection, which is a type of clustering, to find sets of closely connected\nparticles. By using a geographical null model that is constrained by the\nparticles' contact network, we extract chain-like structures that are\nreminiscent of force chains. We propose three diagnostics to measure these\nchain-like structures, and we demonstrate the utility of these diagnostics for\nidentifying and characterizing classes of force-chain network architectures in\nvarious materials. To illustrate our methods, we describe how force-chain\narchitecture depends on pressure for two very different types of packings: (1)\nones derived from laboratory experiments and (2) ones derived from idealized,\nnumerically-generated frictionless packings. By resolving individual force\nchains, we quantify statistical properties of force-chain shape and strength,\nwhich are potentially crucial diagnostics of bulk properties (including\nmaterial stability). These methods facilitate quantitative comparisons between\ndifferent particulate systems, regardless of whether they are measured\nexperimentally or numerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Aug 2014 17:22:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 16:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

The loss of two\nof these reaction wheels reduced the telescope's ability to point precisely for\nextended periods of time, and as a result, the photometric precision has\nsuffered. We present a technique for generating photometric light curves from\npixel-level data obtained with the two-wheeled extended Kepler mission, K2. Our\nphotometric technique accounts for the non-uniform pixel response function of\nthe Kepler detectors by correlating flux measurements with the spacecraft's\npointing and removing the dependence. When we apply our technique to the\nensemble of stars observed during the Kepler Two-Wheel Concept Engineering\nTest, we find improvements over raw K2 photometry by factors of 2-5, with noise\nproperties qualitatively similar to Kepler targets at the same magnitudes. We\nfind evidence that the improvement in photometric precision depends on each\ntarget's position in the Kepler field of view, with worst precision near the\nedges of the field. Overall, this technique restores the median attainable\nphotometric precision to within a factor of two of the original Kepler\nphotometric precision for targets ranging from 10$^{th}$ to 15$^{th}$ magnitude\nin the Kepler bandpass, peaking with a median precision within 35% that of\nKepler for stars between 12$^{th}$ and 13$^{th}$ magnitude in the Kepler\nbandpass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Aug 2014 20:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-06"}

This enables creep deformation when a force is\napplied in the nominally quiescent region through an intruder such as a\ncylindrical or spherical probe.

It is known from\nthe seminal work of Binev, Dahmen, DeVore and Petrushev that such classes are\nrelated to Besov spaces. The range of parameters for which the inverse\nembedding results hold is rather limited, and recently, Gaspoz and Morin have\nshown, among other things, that this limitation disappears if we replace Besov\nspaces by suitable approximation spaces associated to finite element\napproximation from uniformly refined triangulations. We call the latter spaces\n*multievel approximation spaces*, and argue that these spaces are placed\nnaturally halfway between adaptive approximation classes and Besov spaces, in\nthe sense that it is more natural to relate multilevel approximation spaces\nwith either Besov spaces or adaptive approximation classes, than to go directly\nfrom adaptive approximation classes to Besov spaces.

The method uses traces of\nbulk finite element functions on a surface embedded in a volumetric domain. The\nbulk finite element space is defined on an octree grid which is locally refined\nor coarsened depending on error indicators and estimated values of the surface\ncurvatures. The cartesian structure of the bulk mesh leads to easy and\nefficient adaptation process, while the trace finite element method makes\nfitting the mesh to the surface unnecessary. The number of degrees of freedom\ninvolved in computations is consistent with the two-dimension nature of surface\nPDEs. No parametrization of the surface is required; it can be given implicitly\nby a level set function. In practice, a variant of the marching cubes method is\nused to recover the surface with the second order accuracy. We prove the\noptimal order of accuracy for the trace finite element method in $H^1$ and\n$L^2$ surface norms for a problem with smooth solution and quasi-uniform mesh\nrefinement.

As measurement techniques improve, the\ntransit spectra of 'Super-Earths' such as GJ 1214b are becoming better\nconstrained, allowing model atmospheres to be fitted for this class of planet\nalso. While it is not yet possible to constrain the atmospheric states of small\nplanets such as the Earth or cold planets like Jupiter, this may become\npractical in the coming decades and if so, it is of interest to determine what\nwe might infer from such measurements.

We find that a single transit of Jupiter in front of the\nSun could potentially be used to determine temperature and stratospheric\ncomposition, but for the Earth the mean atmospheric composition could only be\ndetermined if it were orbiting an M-dwarf. For both planets we note that direct\nimaging with sufficient nulling of the light from the parent star provides the\nbest method of determining the atmospheric properties of such planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 07:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Artin groups are closely related to Coxeter\ngroups. There is a faithful representation of a Coxeter group $W$ as a linear\nreflection group on a real vector space $V$. The group acts properly and fixes\na union of hyperplanes. The $W$-action extends as the covering space action to\nthe complexified complement of these hyperplanes. The fundamental groups of the\ncomplement and the orbit space are the pure Artin group and the Artin group\nrespectively.

We find that the users' SINR depends on the average transmission\nprobability of BSs, which is defined by a nonlinear equation. As it is\ndifficult to obtain the closed-form solution, we solve this nonlinear equation\nby bisection method. Besides, we formulate the optimization problem to minimize\nthe area power consumption.

To our\nknowledge, this paper makes the first attempt in designing a parallel algorithm\nfor this problem. We conclude this paper by presenting a sequential and\nparallel algorithm for enumerating all Perfect Elimination Orderings of a\nchordal graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 11:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-19"}

Moreover, holographic\ngauge/gravity dualities suggest that bulk spacetime diffeomorphism invariance\ncan be replaced by the properties of boundary CFTs. How can these new\nframeworks be compatible with the traditional notion of reference frame so\nfundamental to our interpretation of General Relativity?

The interpretation of polarised radiation emerging from a planetary\natmosphere must rely on solutions to the vector Radiative Transport Equation\n(vRTE). Monte Carlo integration of the vRTE is a valuable approach for its\nflexible treatment of complex viewing and/or illumination geometries and\nbecause it can intuitively incorporate elaborate physics. Aims. We present a\nnovel Pre-Conditioned Backward Monte Carlo (PBMC) algorithm for solving the\nvRTE and apply it to planetary atmospheres irradiated from above. As classical\nBMC methods, our PBMC algorithm builds the solution by simulating the photon\ntrajectories from the detector towards the radiation source, i.e. in the\nreverse order of the actual photon displacements. Methods. We show that the\nneglect of polarisation in the sampling of photon propagation directions in\nclassical BMC algorithms leads to unstable and biased solutions for\nconservative, optically-thick, strongly-polarising media such as Rayleigh\natmospheres. The numerical difficulty is avoided by pre-conditioning the\nscattering matrix with information from the scattering matrices of prior (in\nthe BMC integration order) photon collisions. Pre-conditioning introduces a\nsense of history in the photon polarisation states through the simulated\ntrajectories. Results. The PBMC algorithm is robust and its accuracy is\nextensively demonstrated via comparisons with examples drawn from the\nliterature for scattering in diverse media. Since the convergence rate for MC\nintegration is independent of the integral's dimension, the scheme is a\nvaluable option for estimating the disk-integrated signal of stellar radiation\nreflected from planets. Such a tool is relevant in the prospective\ninvestigation of exoplanetary phase curves. We lay out two frameworks for disk\nintegration and, as an application, explore the impact of atmospheric\nstratification on planetary phase curves...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 14:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

We measure a spectral energy\ndistribution, which can be modelled using a standard multi-temperature\naccretion disc, where the disc temperature and radius follow a power-law\nrelation. Standard accretion disc theory predicts the power law exponent to be\n-3/4, and this yields, perhaps surprisingly, acceptable fits to our SED. Given\nthat the source is a persistent X-ray source, it is however likely that the\naccretion disc temperature distribution is produced by X-ray heating,\nregardless of its radial dependence. Furthermore, we find no evidence for any\nemission from the secondary star at any wavelength.

We obtain the phase diagram for the quasienergy\nspectrum at flux 1/3 as the driving frequency $\\omega$ and the hopping\nanisotropy are varied. A series of topologically distinct phases with\ncounter-propagating edge modes appear due to the harmonic driving, similar to\nthe case of a periodically kicked system studied earlier.

The mechanisms that form extreme bipolar planetary nebulae remain\nunclear. Aims. The physical properties, structure, and dynamics of the bipolar\nplanetary nebula, MyCn 18, are investigated in detail with the aim of\nunderstanding the shaping mechanism and evolutionary history of this object.\nMethods. VLT infrared images, VLT ISAAC infrared spectra, and long-slit optical\nEchelle spectra are used to investigate MyCn 18. Morpho-kinematic modelling was\nused to firmly constrain the structure and kinematics of the source. A\ntimescale analysis was used to determine the kinematical age of the nebula and\nits main components. Results. A spectroscopic study of MyCn 18's central and\noffset region reveals the detailed make-up of its nebular composition.\nMolecular hydrogen, atomic helium, and Bracket gamma emission are detected from\nthe central regions of MyCn 18. ISAAC spectra from a slit position along the\nnarrow waist of the nebula demonstrate that the ionised gas resides closer to\nthe centre of the nebula than the molecular emission. A kinematical age of the\nnebula and its components were obtained by the P-V arrays and timescale\nanalysis. Conclusions. The structure and kinematics of MyCn 18 are better\nunderstood using an interactive 3-D modelling tool called shape. A dimensional\nand timescale analysis of MyCn 18's major components provides a possible\nmechanism for the nebula's asymmetry. The putative central star is somewhat\noffset from the geometric centre of the nebula, which is thought to be the\nresult of a binary system.

We provide\nbounds for several instances of this question, for the minimum length of\ntopologically non-trivial closed curves, pants decompositions, and cut graphs\nwith a given combinatorial map in triangulated combinatorial surfaces (or their\ndual cross-metric counterpart).\n  Our work builds upon Riemannian systolic inequalities, which bound the\nminimum length of non-trivial closed curves in terms of the genus and the area\nof the surface. We first describe a systematic way to translate Riemannian\nsystolic inequalities to a discrete setting, and vice-versa. This implies a\nconjecture by Przytycka and Przytycki from 1993, a number of new systolic\ninequalities in the discrete setting, and the fact that a theorem of Hutchinson\non the edge-width of triangulated surfaces and Gromov's systolic inequality for\nsurfaces are essentially equivalent.

Yet, if we enforce PSD constraints on the $k$-means LP, we get\nexact cluster recovery at center separation $\\Delta > 2\\sqrt2(1+\\sqrt{1/m})$.\nIn contrast, common heuristics such as Lloyd's algorithm (a.k.a. the $k$-means\nalgorithm) can fail to recover clusters in this setting; even with arbitrarily\nlarge cluster separation, k-means++ with overseeding by any constant factor\nfails with high probability at exact cluster recovery. To complement the\ntheoretical analysis, we provide an experimental study of the recovery\nguarantees for these various methods, and discuss several open problems which\nthese experiments suggest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 15:42:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 18:37:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 18:07:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 16:11:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 02:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-16"}

In solving a problem\nposed by Plummer, Dean (The matching extendability of surfaces, J. Combin.\nTheory Ser.

However inverse Wishart\ndistribution presents some undesirable properties from a modeling point of\nview. It can be too restrictive because assume the same amount of prior\ninformation about every variance parameters and, more important, it shows a\nprior relationship between the variances and correlations.\n  Some alternatives distributions has been proposed.

We develop a theoretical model based on linear\nelastic fracture mechanics to describe the propagation of such precursory slip.\nThe model's prediction of precursor lengths as a function of external load is\nin good quantitative agreement with laboratory experiments as well as with\ndynamic simulations, and provides thereby evidence to recognize frictional slip\nas a fracture phenomenon. We show that predicted precursor lengths depend,\nwithin given uncertainty ranges, mainly on the kinetic friction coefficient,\nand only weakly on other interface and material parameters. By simplifying the\nfracture mechanics model we also reveal sources for the observed non-linearity\nin the growth of precursor lengths as a function of the applied force. The\ndiscrete nature of precursors as well as the shear tractions caused by\nfrustrated Poisson's expansion are found to be the dominant factors.
