This leads to less\nsecure systems, as the security mechanisms are only applied as an afterthought\nand therefore do not integrate well with the rest of the design. Also, several\nstatistics about discovered vulnerabilities in existing systems suggest, that\nmost of the vulnerabilities of a system are not caused by errors in the\ncryptographic primitives, but in other parts of the implementation. So\nintegrating security concerns early in the design process seems a promising\napproach for increasing the security of the resulting system.\n  This work evaluates how the choice of the architectural style affects the\nsecurity of the resulting system. The evaluation is done on the example of an\nexisting certification authority (CA). The requirements for the system are\ngathered and multiple designs according to different architectural styles are\ndrafted and evaluated using a risk evaluation method. Then the evaluated\ndesigns are compared to find out whether there are significant differences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 16:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-13"}

When a protein experiences a changed\nenvironment, it is under strong selection to find a peak in the new fitness\nlandscape. It has been shown that strong selection increases epistatic\ninteractions as well as the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, but little is\nknown about how the epistatic interactions change under selection in the\nlong-term evolution of a protein. Here we analyze the evolution of epistasis in\nthe protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) using protease\nsequences collected for almost a decade from both treated and untreated\npatients, to understand how epistasis changes and how those changes impact the\nlong-term evolvability of a protein. We use an information-theoretic proxy for\nepistasis that quantifies the co-variation between sites, and show that\npositive information is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition that detects\nepistasis in most cases. We analyze the \"fossils\" of the evolutionary\ntrajectories of the protein contained in the sequence data, and show that\nepistasis continues to enrich under strong selection, but not for proteins\nwhose environment is unchanged. The increase in epistasis compensates for the\ninformation loss due to sequence variability brought about by treatment, and\nfacilitates adaptation in the increasingly rugged fitness landscape of\ntreatment. While epistasis is thought to enhance evolvability via\nvalley-crossing early-on in adaptation, it can hinder adaptation later when the\nlandscape has turned rugged. However, we find no evidence that the HIV-1\nprotease has reached its potential for evolution after 9 years of adapting to a\ndrug environment that itself is constantly changing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 16:04:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Jan 2015 04:39:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 21:11:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 16:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-01"}

Both precision scalings surpass the\nnonlinear scaling of ${\\bar n}^{-3/2}$, the best so far achieved or proposed\nwith a physical system. Our method of achieving a decoupled three-body\ninteracting system may also have applications in the creation of exotic\nthree-body states and phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 16:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-06"}

Here, we perform an analytical and numerical study\non model networks in three dimensions. Our model consists of a collection of\nrandomly oriented rigid filaments connected by flexible crosslinks that are\nmodeled as wormlike chains. Due to zero probability of filament intersection in\nthree dimensions, our model networks are by construction prestressed in terms\nof initial tension in the crosslinks.

Under the assumption\nof affine deformations in the limit of infinite crosslink density, we show\nanalytically that the nonlinear elastic regime in 1- and 2-dimensional networks\nis characterized by power-law scaling of the elastic modulus with the stress.\nIn contrast, 3-dimensional networks show an exponential dependence of the\nmodulus on stress. Independent of dimensionality, if the crosslink density is\nfinite, we show that the only persistent scaling exponent is that of the single\nwormlike chain.

For\ngeneric Dirac mass of the neutrinos, i.e. with all Yukawa couplings $\\lesssim\n10^{-5.5}$, it has been pointed out that successful leptogenesis requires a\nlower bound of 18 TeV on the $W_R$ mass, pushing it beyond the reach of LHC.\nSuch TeV-scale LRSM must, however, be parity-asymmetric for type-I seesaw to\ngive the observed neutrino masses. This class of models can accommodate larger\nYukawa couplings, which give simultaneous fits to charged-lepton and neutrino\nmasses, by invoking either cancellations or specific symmetry-textures for\nDirac ($M_D$) and Majorana ($M_N$) masses in the seesaw formula.

We\nstudied the possibility that the sub-surface material, perhaps on one\nhemisphere, has spectral characteristics differing from the original weathered\nsurface, by performing rotationally-resolved spectroscopic observations to look\nfor local variations as the asteroid rotates. We observed 11 asteroids in pairs\nin the near-IR and visible range. Photometry was also conducted to determine\nthe rotational phases of a spectrum on the asteroid lightcurves. We do not\ndetect any rotational spectral variations within the signal-to-noise, which\nallow us to constrain the extent of any existing surface heterogeneity.\n  For each observed spectrum of a longitudinal segment of an asteroid, we\nestimate the maximal size of an un-detected \"spot\" with a spectral signature\ndifferent than the average. For 5 asteroids the maximal diameter of such a spot\nis smaller by a factor of two than the diameter of the secondary member.\nTherefore, the site of the fission is larger than any area with a unique\nspectral parameters and the site of the fission does not have a unique\nspectrum. In the case of an S-complex asteroid, where the site of fission is\nexpected to present non-weathered spectra, a lack of a fission spot can be\nexplained if the rotational-fission process is followed by the spread of dust\nthat re-accumulates on the primary asteroid and covers it homogeneously. This\nis demonstrated for the young asteroid 6070 that presents an Sq-type spectrum\nwhile its inner material, that is presumably revealed on the surface of its\nsecondary member, 54827, has a fresher, Q-type spectrum. The spread of dust\nobserved in the disruption event of asteroid P/2013 R3, might be an example of\nsuch a process and an indication that it was indeed formed in a\nrotational-fission event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 20:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The concept requires two masks, which we call Front Mask,\nand Rear Mask, separated by a gap that defines the thickness of the slit. The\npitch and the diameter of the holes define the linear geometry of the slit; the\ncurvature of each mask defines the angular geometry of the slit.

Unfortunately, entropy-based diversity indices, or diversity\nindices for short, suffer from three problems. First, when computing the\ndiversity for samples withdrawn from communities with different structures,\ndiversity indices can easily yield non-comparable and hard to interpret\nresults. Second, diversity indices impose weighting schemes on the species\ndistributions that unnecessarily emphasize low abundant rare species, or\nerroneously identified ones. Third, diversity indices do not allow for\ncomparing distributions against each other, which is necessary when a community\nhas a well-known species' distribution.\n  In this paper we propose a new general methodology based on information\ntheoretic principles to quantify the species diversity of a community. Our\nmethodology, comprised of two steps, naturally overcomes the previous mentioned\nproblems, and yields comparable and easy to interpret diversity values. We show\nthat our methodology retains all the functional properties of any diversity\nindex, and yet is far more flexible than entropy--based diversity indices.

In the first\ncomponent of the catalytic cycle, pyridine (Py) undergoes a H+ transfer (PT) to\nform pyridinium (PyH+) followed by an e- transfer (ET) to produce pyridinium\nradical (PyH0). Examples of systems to effect this ET to populate the LUMO of\nPyH+(E0calc ~ -1.3V vs. SCE) to form the solution phase PyH0 via highly\nreducing electrons include the photo-electrochemical p-GaP system (ECBM ~ -1.5V\nvs. SCE at pH= 5) and the photochemical [Ru(phen)3]2+/ascorbate system. We\npredict that PyH0 undergoes further PT-ET steps to form the key closed-shell,\ndearomatized 1,2-dihydropyridine (PyH2) species. Our proposed sequential\nPT-ET-PT-ET mechanism transforming Py into PyH2 is consistent with the\nmechanism described in the formation of related dihydropyridines. Because it is\ndriven by its proclivity to regain aromaticity, PyH2 is a potent recyclable\norgano-hydride donor that mimics the role of NADPH in the formation of C-H\nbonds in the photosynthetic CO2 reduction process. In particular, in the second\ncomponent of the catalytic cycle, we predict that the PyH2/Py redox couple is\nkinetically and thermodynamically competent in catalytically effecting hydride\nand proton transfers (the latter often mediated by a proton relay chain) to CO2\nand its two succeeding intermediates, namely formic acid and formaldehyde, to\nultimately form CH3OH. The hydride and proton transfers for the first reduction\nstep, i.e. reduction of CO2, are sequential in nature; by contrast, they are\ncoupled in each of the two subsequent hydride and proton transfers to reduce\nformic acid and formaldehyde.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 21:53:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-20"}

In general,\nclassifier diversity does not occur randomly, but is generated systematically\nby various ensemble creation methods. By using diverse data subsets to train\nclassifiers, these methods can create diverse classifiers for the EoC. In this\nwork, we propose a scheme to measure data diversity directly from random\nsubspaces, and explore the possibility of using it to select the best data\nsubsets for the construction of the EoC. Our scheme is the first ensemble\nselection method to be presented in the literature based on the concept of data\ndiversity. Its main advantage over the traditional framework (ensemble creation\nthen selection) is that it obviates the need for classifier training prior to\nensemble selection. A single Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Multi-Objective\nGenetic Algorithm (MOGA) were evaluated to search for the best solutions for\nthe classifier-free ensemble selection. In both cases, objective functions\nbased on different clustering diversity measures were implemented and tested.\nAll the results obtained with the proposed classifier-free ensemble selection\nmethod were compared with the traditional classifier-based ensemble selection\nusing Mean Classifier Error (ME) and Majority Voting Error (MVE).

It is\nfound that the appearance of hyperons has little impact on baryonic density\nrange and size for the $^{1}S_{0}$ neutronic pairing gap, the $^{1}S_{0}$\nprotonic pairing gap also decreases slightly in this region $\\rho_B=0.0-0.393$\nfm$^{-3}$. However, if baryonic density becomes greater than 0.393 fm${^{-3}}$,\nthe $^{1}S_{0}$ protonic pairing gap obviously increases. In addition, the\nprotonic superfluid range is obviously enlarged due to the presence of\nhyperons. In our results, the hyperons change the $^{1}S_{0}$ protonic pairing\ngap which must change the cooling properties of neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 00:48:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Our approach is\nbased on a mesoscopic viewpoint of the traffic system in terms of the dynamics\nof vehicle speed transitions. A key feature of the present approach lies in its\nstochastic nature which makes it possible to study not only the\nflow-concentration relation, namely, the fundamental diagram, but also its\nuncertainty, namely, the variance of the fundamental diagram \\textemdash an\nimportant characteristic in the observed traffic flow data. It is shown that in\nthe simplified versions of the model consisting of only a few speed states,\nanalytic solutions for both quantities can be obtained, which facilitate the\ndiscussion of the corresponding physical content. We also show that the effect\nof vehicle size can be included into the model by introducing the maximal\ncongestion density $k_{max}$. By making use of this parameter, the free flow\nregion and congested flow region are naturally divided, and the transition is\ncharacterized by the capacity drop at the maximum of the flow-concentration\nrelation. The model parameters are then adjusted to the observed traffic flow\non the I-80 Freeway Dataset in the San Francisco area from the NGSIM program,\nwhere both the fundamental diagram and its variance are reasonably reproduced.\nDespite its simplicity, we argue that the current model provides an alternative\ndescription for the fundamental diagram and its uncertainty in the study of\ntraffic flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 02:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Aug 2014 15:46:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 19:47:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2016 13:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

Clustering is a\nkey technique for this and helps in maximizing the network lifetime and\nscalability. Most of the routing and data dissemination protocols of WSN assume\na homogeneous network architecture, in which all sensors have the same\ncapabilities in terms of battery power, communication, sensing, storage, and\nprocessing. Recently, there has been an interest in heterogeneous sensor\nnetworks, especially for real deployments. This research paper has proposed a\nnew energy aware clustering protocol (EACP) for heterogeneous wireless sensor\nnetworks. Heterogeneity is introduced in EACP by using two types of nodes:\nnormal and advanced. In EACP cluster heads for normal nodes are elected with\nthe help of a probability scheme based on residual and average energy of the\nnormal nodes. This will ensure that only the high residual normal nodes can\nbecome the cluster head in a round. Advanced nodes use a separate probability\nbased scheme for cluster head election and they will further act as a gateway\nfor normal cluster heads and transmit their data load to base station when they\nare not doing the duty of a cluster head. Finally a sleep state is suggested\nfor some sensor nodes during cluster formation phase to save network energy.\nThe performance of EACP is compared with SEP and simulation result shows the\nbetter result for stability period, network life and energy saving than SEP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 04:56:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-14"}

Energy conservation and prolonging the\nnetwork life are two major challenges in a sensor network. Communication\nconsumes the large portion of WSN energy. Several protocols have been proposed\nto realize power- efficient communication in a wireless sensor network.

Our calculations are\ncompletely based on general relativity and especially the structure of neutron\nstars is obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations with\nnuclear matter equation of state constrained by terrestrial experiments. We\nfind that, by considering the more realistic neutron star model rather than a\nsimple uniform neutron sphere as usual, the $\\sigma_{\\rm p}$ bounds from old\nneutron stars can be varied by more than an order of magnitude depending on the\nspecific values of the DM neutron-to-proton coupling ratio $f_{\\rm n}/f_{\\rm\np}$, and they can be further varied by more than a factor of two depending on\nthe density dependence of the symmetry energy.

We show that all kinds of stellar or neutron star flares would\nbe too weak for the observed energy input at Earth in AD 774/5. Even though\nMaehara et al. (2012) present two super-flares with 10e35 erg of presumably\nsolar-type stars, we would like to caution: These two stars are poorly studied\nand may well be close binaries, and/or having a M-type dwarf companion, and/or\nmay be much younger and/or much more magnetic than the Sun - in any such case,\nthey might not be true solar analog stars. From the frequency of large stellar\nflares averaged over all stellar activity phases (maybe obtained only during\ngrand activity maxima), one can derive (a limit of) the probability for a large\nsolar flare at a random time of normal activity: We find the probability for\none flare within 3000 years to be possibly as low as 0.3 to 0.008 considering\nthe full 1 sigma error range.

In the History of al-Tabari we found two\n(almost identical) reports about such an event. The group around caliph\nal-Mansur observed a transient event while on the way from Baghdad to Mecca on\nAD 775 Aug 29 - Sep 1 (Julian calendar).

The cytoskeletal\nbinding sites are in contact with the same finite reservoir of motors (either\nthe cytosol or the flow chamber) and hence compete for recruiting the available\nmotors, potentially depleting the reservoir and affecting cytoskeletal\ntransport. In this work we provide a theoretical framework to study,\nanalytically and numerically, how motor density profiles and crowding along\ncytoskeletal filaments depend on the competition of motors for their binding\nsites. We propose two models in which finite processive motor proteins actively\nadvance along cytoskeletal filaments and are continuously exchanged with the\nmotor pool. We first look at homogeneous reservoirs and then examine the\neffects of free motor diffusion in the surrounding medium. We consider as a\nreference situation recent in vitro experimental setups of kinesin-8 motors\nbinding and moving along microtubule filaments in a flow chamber. We\ninvestigate how the crowding of linear motor proteins moving on a filament can\nbe regulated by the balance between supply (concentration of motor proteins in\nthe flow chamber) and demand (total number of polymerised tubulin\nheterodimers). We present analytical results for the density profiles of bound\nmotors, the reservoir depletion, and propose novel phase diagrams that present\nthe formation of jams of motor proteins on the filament as a function of two\ntuneable experimental parameters: the motor protein concentration and the\nconcentration of tubulins polymerized into cytoskeletal filaments.

In the air annealed film charge order (CO) is quenched and ferromagnetic\n(FM) transition, which appears at TC=148 K is followed by antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) transition at TN=104 K. This film shows self-field hysteretic\ninsulator-metal transition (IMT) at TIMC=89 K and TIMW=148 K in the cooling and\nwarming cycle, respectively. Application of magnetic field (H) gradually\nenhances TIMC and TIMW, reduces the thermoresistive hysteresis and TIM\ndiminishes. In contrast, the film annealed in flowing oxygen shows a CO\ntransition, which is followed by FM and AFM transitions. This film shows\nappreciably smaller magnetic moment and does not show IMT upto H=20 kOe. As H\nis increased to H=30 kOe, IMT having strong thermoresistive hysteresis and\nsharp resistivity jumps appears in the cooling and warming cycles. As H\nincreases to higher values the thermoresistive hysteresis is reduced,\nresistivity jumps are observed to disappear and TIM decreases. In the lower\ntemperature regime the resistivity first decreases slowly with H and then shows\nsharp drop. The virgin cycle is not recoverable in subsequent cycles. The\ndecrement far more pronounced in the oxygen annealed film and occurs at much\nhigher H suggesting that the frozen cluster glass state is more robust in this\nfilm. The microstructural analysis of the two set of films shows CO quenching,\nFM transition and self-field IMT in air annealed film is caused by higher\ndensity of microstructural disorder and lattice defects. The difference in\ngrowth ambience of the two films could give rise to such microstructural\nperturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 11:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-14"}

It\nis widely recognized that Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are among the\nmost important contributors to the Galactic fluorine production. In general,\nextant nucleosynthesis models overestimate the fluorine production by AGB stars\nwith respect to observations. In this paper we review the relevant nuclear\nreaction rates involved in the fluorine production/destruction. We perform this\nanalysis on a model with initial mass M=2 M$_\\odot$ and Z=0.001. We found that\nthe major uncertainties are due to the $^{13}$C($\\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O, the\n$^{19}$F($\\alpha$,p)$^{22}$Ne and the $^{14}$N(p,$\\gamma$)$^{15}$O reactions. A\nchange of the corresponding reaction rates within the present experimental\nuncertainties implies surface $^{19}$F variations at the AGB tip lower than\n10\\%. For some $\\alpha$ capture reactions, however, larger variations in the\nrates of those processes cannot be excluded. Thus, we explore the effects of\nthe variation of some $\\alpha$ capture rates well beyond the current published\nuncertainties. The largest $^{19}$F variations are obtained by varying the\n$^{15}$N($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^{19}$F and the $^{19}$F($\\alpha$,p)$^{22}$Ne\nreactions. The analysis of some $\\alpha$ capture processes assuming a wider\nuncertainty range determines $^{19}$F abundances in better agreement with\nrecent spectroscopic fluorine measurements at low metallicity. In the framework\nof the latter scenario the $^{15}$N($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^{19}$F and the\n$^{19}$F($\\alpha$,p)$^{22}$Ne reactions show the largest effects on fluorine\nnucleosynthesis. The presence of poorly known low energy resonances make such a\nscenario, even if unlikely, possible.

We carried out a multiwavelength study to\ncharacterize the magnetic activity of the HD 181068 system. To this end, we\nobtained in- and out-of-eclipse X-ray snapshots with XMM-Newton and an optical\nspectrum, which we analyzed along with the Kepler light-curve.

During the second X-ray observation, we found a three-times\nelevated -- yet decaying -- level of X-ray emission, which might be due to an\nX-ray flare. The high level of magnetic activity is compatible with the\npreviously reported absence of solar-like oscillations in the giant, whose\natmosphere, however, undergoes tidally-induced oscillations imposed by the\nchanging configuration of the dwarf-binary.

In\nparticular, we show that even subsonic turbulent motions reduce the magnetic\nbraking efficiency sufficiently in order to allow rotationally supported discs\nto form. We therefore suggest that already during the Class 0 stage the\nfraction of Keplerian discs is significantly higher than 50%, consistent with\nrecent observational trends but significantly higher than predictions based on\nsimulations with misaligned magnetic fields, demonstrating the importance of\nturbulent motions for the formation of Keplerian discs.

The magnetic field structure in the vicinity of the discs is highly\ndisordered, revealing field reversals up to distances of 1000 AU. These\nfindings demonstrate that as soon as even mild turbulent motions are included,\nthe classical disc formation scenario of a coherently rotating environment and\na well-ordered magnetic field breaks down. Hence, it is highly questionable to\nassess the magnetic braking efficiency based on non-turbulent collapse\nsimulation.

The proposed work here uses HSV color space, since HSV color space\nseparates color details from intensity. The enhancement of medical image is\nachieved by down sampling the original image into five versions, namely, tiny,\nsmall, medium, fine, and normal scale. This is due to the fact that the each\nversions of the image when independently enhanced and reconstructed results in\nenormous improvement in the visual quality. Further, the contrast stretching\nand MultiScale Retinex (MSR) techniques are exploited in order to enhance each\nof the scaled version of the image. Finally, the enhanced image is obtained by\ncombining each of these scales in an efficient way to obtain the composite\nenhanced image. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is validated by using\na wavelet energy metric in the wavelet domain. Reconstructed image using\nproposed method highlights the details (edges and tissues), reduces image noise\n(Gaussian and Speckle) and improves the overall contrast. The proposed\nalgorithm also enhances sharp edges of the tissue surrounding the spinal cord\nregions which is useful for diagnosis of spinal cord lesions. Elaborated\nexperiments are conducted on several medical images and results presented show\nthat the enhanced medical pictures are of good quality and is found to be\nbetter compared with other researcher methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 12:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-14"}

In a quest for empirical evidence verifying or disproving the\nrole of magnetic fields in shaping PNe, we follow up on previous attempts to\nmeasure the magnetic field in a representative sample of PN central stars. We\nobtained low-resolution polarimetric spectra with FORS 2 at VLT for a sample of\ntwelve bright central stars of PNe with different morphology, including two\nround nebulae, seven elliptical nebulae, and three bipolar nebulae. Two targets\nare Wolf-Rayet type central stars. For the majority of the observed central\nstars, we do not find any significant evidence for the existence of surface\nmagnetic fields. However, our measurements may indicate the presence of weak\nmean longitudinal magnetic fields of the order of 100 Gauss in the central star\nof the young elliptical planetary nebula IC 418, as well as in the Wolf-Rayet\ntype central star of the bipolar nebula Hen2-113 and the weak emission line\ncentral star of the elliptical nebula Hen2-131. A clear detection of a 250 G\nmean longitudinal field is achieved for the A-type companion of the central\nstar of NGC 1514. Some of the central stars show a moderate night-to-night\nspectrum variability, which may be the signature of a variable stellar wind\nand/or rotational modulation due to magnetic features. We conclude that strong\nmagnetic fields of the order of kG are not widespread among PNe central stars.\nNevertheless, simple estimates based on a theoretical model of magnetized wind\nbubbles suggest that even weak magnetic fields below the current detection\nlimit of the order of 100 G may well be sufficient to contribute to the shaping\nof PNe throughout their evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 13:14:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 10:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

Most of the routing\nand data dissemination protocols of WSN assume a homogeneous network\narchitecture, in which all sensors have the same capabilities in terms of\nbattery power, communication, sensing, storage, and processing. However the\ncontinued advances in miniaturization of processors and low-power\ncommunications have enabled the development of a wide variety of nodes. When\nmore than one type of node is integrated into a WSN, it is called\nheterogeneous. Multihop short distance communication is an important scheme to\nreduce the energy consumption in a sensor network because nodes are densely\ndeployed in a WSN. In this paper M-EECDA (Multihop Energy Efficient Clustering\n& Data Aggregation Protocol for Heterogeneous WSN) is proposed and analyzed.\nThe protocol combines the idea of multihop communications and clustering for\nachieving the best performance in terms of network life and energy consumption.\nM-EECDA introduces a sleep state and three tier architecture for some cluster\nheads to save energy of the network. M-EECDA consists of three types of sensor\nnodes: normal, advance and super. To become cluster head in a round normal\nnodes use residual energy based scheme. Advance and super nodes further act as\nrelay node to reduce the transmission load of a normal node cluster head when\nthey are not cluster heads in a round.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 05:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

It is\nmainly done by assuming mass and charge of the black hole as small quantities\n($\\epsilon$), and by retaining its second power in the perturbed geodesic\nequations for such black hole while neglecting its higher powers. Due to the\npresence of trivial second-order approximate Lie symmetries of these perturbed\ngeodesic equations, a rescaling of the geodetic parameter gives a rescaling of\nthe energy in this black hole. Interestingly we obtain an explicit relation of\nthe rescaling factor that depends on the square of the charge to mass ratio of\nthe black hole, the normalization factor $\\alpha$, which is related to the\nstate parameter of the quintessence matter, and the coordinate $r$. A\ncomparison of this rescaling factor with that of the Reissner-Nordstrom black\nhole (Hussain et. al SIGMA, 2007), without quintessence is given.

The PFS spectrograph is designed to\ncollect spectra from 2394 objects simultaneously, covering wavelengths that\nextend from 380 nm - 1.26 um. The spectrograph is comprised of four identical\nspectrograph modules, with each module collecting roughly 600 spectra from a\nrobotic fiber positioner at the telescope prime focus. Each spectrograph module\nwill have two visible channels covering wavelength ranges 380 nm - 640 nm and\n640 nm - 955 nm, and one near infrared (NIR) channel with a wavelength range\n955 nm - 1.26 um. Dispersed light in each channel is imaged by a 300 mm focal\nlength, f/1.07, vacuum Schmidt camera onto a 4k x 4k, 15 um pixel, detector\nformat. For the NIR channel a HgCdTe substrate-removed Teledyne 1.7 um cutoff\ndevice is used. In the visible channels, CCDs from Hamamatsu are used. These\ncameras are large, having a clear aperture of 300 mm at the entrance window,\nand a mass of ~ 250 kg.\n  Like the two visible channel cameras, the NIR camera contains just four\noptical elements: a two-element refractive corrector, a Mangin mirror, and a\nfield flattening lens. This simple design produces very good imaging\nperformance considering the wide field and wavelength range, and it does so in\nlarge part due to the use of a Mangin mirror (a lens with a reflecting rear\nsurface) for the Schmidt primary. In the case of the NIR camera, the rear\nreflecting surface is a dichroic, which reflects in-band wavelengths and\ntransmits wavelengths beyond 1.26 um. This, combined with a thermal rejection\nfilter coating on the rear surface of the second corrector element, greatly\nreduces the out-of-band thermal radiation that reaches the detector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 20:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

While this regularizes the problem to an extent where it can be\nsolved, it also biases the result toward the expected. With inappropriate\npriors harming more than they use, it remains unclear what prior to use for a\ngiven practical problem. Priors are hence mostly chosen in an {\\em ad hoc} or\nempirical fashion. We argue here that the gradient distribution of\nnatural-scene images may provide a versatile and well-founded prior for\nbiomedical images. We provide motivation for this choice from different points\nof view, and we fully validate the resulting prior for use on biomedical images\nby showing its stability and correlation with image quality. We then provide a\nset of simple parametric models for the resulting prior, leading to\nstraightforward (quasi-)convex optimization problems for which we provide\nefficient solver algorithms.
