The model has LCDM background dynamics, and the `holes' are\nnon-symmetric structures described by the Szekeres metric. The Szekeres exact\nsolution of Einstein's equations, which is inhomogeneous and anisotropic,\nallows us to capture potentially relevant effects on light propagation due to\nnontrivial evolution of structures in an exact framework. Light beams\ntraversing a single Szekeres structure in different ways can experience either\nmagnification or demagnification, depending on the particular path, and we\nexplore a small additional effect due time evolution of the structures. We\nstudy the probability distributions of $\\Delta\\mu=\\mu_{LCDM}-\\mu_{SC}$ for\nsources at different redshifts in various Swiss-cheese constructions, where the\nlight beams travel through a large number of randomly oriented holes with\nrandom impact parameters. We find for $\\Delta\\mu$ the dispersions $0.004\\le\n\\sigma_{\\Delta\\mu} \\le 0.008$ mag for sources with redshifts $1.0\\le z \\le\n1.5$, which are smaller than the intrinsic dispersion of, for example,\nmagnitudes of type Ia supernovae. The shapes of the distributions we obtain for\nour Swiss-cheese constructions are peculiar in the sense that they are not\nconsistently skewed toward the demagnification side, as they are in analyses of\nlensing in cosmological simulations, reflecting a limitation of these\nconstructions. This could be the result of requiring the continuity of\nEinstein's equations throughout the overall spacetime patchwork, which imposes\nthe condition that compensating overdense shells must accompany the underdense\nvoid regions in the holes. The possibility to explore other uses of these\nconstructions that could circumvent this limitation and lead to different\nstatistics remains open.

Here I discuss in detail the improved calculation of $\\beta^{\\pm}$\ndecay rates for iron isotopes ($^{54,55,56}$Fe) in stellar environment. The\npn-QRPA theory allows a microscopic \"state-by-state\" calculation of stellar\nrates as explained later in text. Excited state Gamow-Teller distributions are\nmuch different from ground state and a microscopic calculation of decay rates\nfrom these excited states greatly increases the reliability of the total decay\nrate calculation specially during the late stages of stellar evolution. The\nreported decay rates are also compared with earlier calculations. The positron\ndecay rates are in reasonable agreement with the large-scale shell model\ncalculation. The main finding of this work includes that the stellar\n$\\beta$-decay rates of $^{54,55,56}$Fe are around 3 -- 5 orders of magnitude\nsmaller than previously assumed and hence irrelevant for the determination of\nthe evolution of $Y_{e}$ during the presupernova phase of massive stars.

This\nthesis explores an alternative treatment of the motion of a radiating electron,\nbased on an equation first proposed by Ford and O'Connell. A general condition\nis found for solutions of this equation to deviate from those of\nLandau-Lifshitz.\n  By exploring radiation reaction effects on a particle colliding with an\nultra-intense laser pulse we show that the regime where there is a significant\ndeviation of these two approaches can never be reached with existing or\nproposed laser facilities. The methods used to explore single particle\ninteraction with an intense laser pulse are extended to describe the\ninteraction of a particle bunch with various realistic laser pulses. We find\nthat the interaction leads to a decrease in average momentum and relative\nmomentum spread. However, the decrease appears to be independent of the length\nof the pulse and depends only on the energy in the pulse regardless of how it\nis distributed. Radiation reaction effects occuring during the scattering of an\nelectron by a heavy, highly-charged nucleus are studied. Radiation reaction is\nseen to affect the particle's motion.

This\nreminds us of the so-called fundamental \"constants\" of nature. Recent and past\nmeasurements of the fine structure constant and of the proton-electron mass\nratio suggest that basic quantities of the standard model, such as the QCD\nscale parameter $\\Lambda_{QCD}$, might not be conserved in the course of the\ncosmological evolution. The masses of the nucleons and of the atomic nuclei\nwould be time-evolving. This can be consistent with General Relativity provided\nthe vacuum energy itself is a dynamical quantity. Another framework realizing\nthis possibility is QHD (Quantum Haplodynamics), a fundamental theory of bound\nstates. If one assumes that its running couplings unify at the Planck scale and\nthat such scale changes slowly with cosmic time, the masses of the nucleons and\nof the DM particles, including the cosmological term, will evolve with time.\nThis could explain the dark energy of the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 18:54:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 07:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

However, as this set consists\nonly of product states, such a distance captures all the correlations (quantum\nand classical) between modes. Therefore it is merely un upper bound for the\ngeometric discord, no matter which is the employed distance. In this work we\nchoose for this purpose the Hellinger metric that is known to have many\nbeneficial properties recommending it as a good measure of quantum behaviour.\nIn general, this metric is determined by affinity, a relative of the Uhlmann\nfidelity with which it shares many important features. As a first step of our\nwork, the affinity of a pair of $n$-mode Gaussian states is written. Then, in\nthe two-mode case, we succeeded in determining exactly the closest Gaussian\nproduct state and computed the Gaussian discord accordingly. The obtained\ngeneral formula is remarkably simple and becomes still friendlier in the\nsignificant case of symmetric two-mode Gaussian states. We then analyze in\ndetail two special classes of two-mode Gaussian states of theoretical and\nexperimental interest as well: the squeezed thermal states and the mode-mixed\nthermal ones. The former are separable under a well-known threshold of\nsqueezing, while the latter are always separable. It is worth stressing that\nfor symmetric states belonging to either of these classes, we find consistency\nbetween their geometric Hellinger discord and the originally defined discord in\nthe Gaussian approach. At the same time, the Gaussian Hellinger discord of such\na state turns out to be a reliable measure of the total amount of its cross\ncorrelations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 20:42:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2015 22:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Accordingly, XCN and CNX series of species are introduced\nwhere X stands for a quantum particle with a unit of positive charge and a\nvariable mass that is varied in discrete steps between the masses of proton and\npositron. Ab initio non-Born-Oppenheimer (non-BO) calculations are done on both\nseries of species and the resulting non-BO wavefunctions are used for the\nMC-QTAIM analysis revealing a triatomic structure for the proton mass and a\ndiatomic structure for the positron mass. In both series of species a critical\nmass between that of proton and positron mass is discovered where the\ntransition from triatomic to diatomic structure takes place. This abrupt\nstructural transformation has a topological nature resembling the usual phase\ntransitions in thermodynamics.

The\ncomplex wave numbers and the boundary condition give the analytic equations for\nthe energies and the wave functions of the edge states. The numerical solutions\nof the equations reveal the intriguing spatial behaviors of the edge state. We\ndefine an edge-state width for analyzing the spatial variation of the\nedge-state wave function. Our results show that the edge-state width can be\neasily controlled by a couple of parameters such as the spin-orbit coupling and\nthe sublattice potential. The parameter dependences of the edge-state width\nshow substantial differences depending on the edge types. These demonstrate\nthat, even if the edge states are protected by the topological property of the\nbulk, their detailed properties are still discriminated by their edges. This\nedge dependence can be crucial in manufacturing small-sized devices since the\nlength scale of the edge state is highly subject to the edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 02:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-21"}

In\nparticular, for the extreme accretion rates $\\dot M\\sim 0.1-1$~\nM$_\\odot$s$^{-1}$ expected for bursts of duration $T\\lesssim 100$~s, the disc\ncan be an efficient neutrino emitter. Neutrino-antineutrino annihilation\nresults in an energy deposition rate at the jet that can, in principle, account\nfor the burst's energetics.

Optically injected\nexciton spins precess while diffusing over distances exceeding 20 {\\mu}m from\nthe excitation spot with a spatial precession frequency that depends on the\nspin transport direction as well as on the bias applied across the DQW\nstructure.

From the dependence of\nthe spin dynamics on the transport direction, bias and external magnetic fields\nwe directly determined the Dresselhaus and Rashba spin splitting coefficients\nfor the structure. The precession dynamics is essentially independent on the IX\ndensity, thus indicating that the long spin lifetimes are not associated with\nIX collective effects. The latter, together with the negligible contribution of\nholes to the spin dynamics, are rather attributed to spatial separation of the\nelectron and hole wave functions by the electric field, which reduces the\nelectron-hole exchange interaction.

From a Gaussian\ndecomposition of the metallicity distribution functions, we unveil a clear\nbimodality in all fields, with the relative size of components depending of the\nspecific position on the sky. In agreement with some previous studies, we find\na mild gradient along the minor axis (-0.05 dex/deg between b=-6 and b=-10)\nthat arises from the varying proportion of metal-rich and metal-poor\ncomponents. The number of metal-rich stars fades in favor of the metal-poor\nstars with increasing b. The K-magnitude distribution of the metal-rich\npopulation splits into two peaks for two of the analyzed fields that intersects\nthe near and far branches of the X-shaped bulge structure. In addition, two\nlateral fields at (l,b)=(7,-9) and (l,b)=(-10,-8) present contrasting\ncharacteristics. In the former, the metallicity distribution is dominated by\nmetal-rich stars, while in the latter it presents a mix of a metal-poor\npopulation and and a metal-intermediate one, of nearly equal sizes.

This\nbehavior is well known from the simpler case of hadroproduction of colourless\nhigh-mass systems, such as vector or Higgs boson(s).

The\nnondegeneracy condition is generically satisfied.\n  This appears to be the first leafwise fixed point result in which neither\n$\\phi\\big|_N$ is assumed to be $C^1$-close to the inclusion $N\\to M$, nor $N$\nto be of contact type or regular (i.e., \"fibering\"). It is optimal in the sense\nthat the $C^0$-condition on $\\phi$ cannot be replaced by the assumption that\n$\\phi$ is Hofer-small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 09:31:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 16:40:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-17"}

The\ncentral region of M31 has significantly different properties than the outer\nparts: The star formation rate is low, and inclination and position angle are\nlargely different from the outer disk. The existing model of the magnetic field\nin the radial range 6<=r<=14 kpc is extended to the innermost part r<=0.5 kpc\nto ultimately achieve a picture of the entire magnetic field in M31. We\ncombined observations taken with the VLA at 3.6 cm and 6.2 cm with data from\nthe Effelsberg 100-m telescope to fill the missing spacings of the synthesis\ndata. The resulting polarization maps were averaged in sectors to analyse the\nazimuthal behaviour of the polarized intensity (PI), rotation measure (RM), and\napparent pitch angle (\\phi_obs). We developed a simplified 3-D model for the\nmagnetic field in the central region to explain the azimuthal behaviour of the\nthree observables. Our 3-D model of a quadrupolar or dipolar dynamo field can\nexplain the observed patterns in PI, RM, and \\phi_obs, while a 2-D\nconfiguration is not sufficient to explain the azimuthal behaviour. In addition\nand independent of our model, the RM pattern shows that the spiral magnetic\nfield in the inner 0.5 kpc points outward, which is opposite to that in the\nouter disk, and has a pitch angle of about 33 degrees, which is much larger\nthan that of 8-19 degrees in the outer disk. The physical conditions in the\ncentral region differ significantly from those in the 10 kpc ring. In addition,\nthe orientation of this region with respect to the outer disk is completely\ndifferent. The opposite magnetic field directions suggest that the central\nregion is decoupled from the outer disk, and we propose that an independent\ndynamo is active in the central region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 09:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This paper will introduce into the diverse field of carbon\nmaterials by recollecting some effects in carbon that can be used to produce a\nmultiple time switchable, non-volatile unipolar resistive memory with potential\nhigh scalability down to atomic dimensions.

Since the early work of Jonas Mockus and Antanas\n\\v{Z}ilinskas in the 70's, the problem of optimization is usually formulated by\nconsidering the loss function $\\max f - M_n$ (where $M_n$ denotes the best\nfunction value observed after $n$ evaluations of $f$). This loss function puts\nemphasis on the value of the maximum, at the expense of the location of the\nmaximizer. In the special case of a one-step Bayes-optimal strategy, it leads\nto the classical Expected Improvement (EI) sampling criterion. This is a\nspecial case of a Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction (SUR) strategy, where the risk\nassociated to a certain uncertainty measure (here, the expected loss) on the\nquantity of interest is minimized at each step of the algorithm. In this\narticle, assuming that $f$ is defined over a measure space $(\\mathbb{X},\n\\lambda)$, we propose to consider instead the integral loss function\n$\\int_{\\mathbb{X}} (f - M_n)_{+}\\, d\\lambda$, and we show that this leads, in\nthe case of a Gaussian process prior, to a new numerically tractable sampling\ncriterion that we call $\\rm EI^2$ (for Expected Integrated Expected\nImprovement).

The second subsample (Herschel sample) is a sample of\n28 compact star-forming galaxies observed with Herschel in the FIR range. Data\nof the Herschel sample were supplemented by the photometric data from the\nSpitzer observations, GALEX, SDSS, WISE, 2MASS, NVSS, and FIRST surveys, as\nwell as optical and Spitzer spectra and data in sub-mm and radio ranges. It is\nfound that warm dust luminosities of galaxies from the SDSS sample and cold and\nwarm dust luminosities of galaxies from the Herschel sample are strongly\ncorrelated with Hbeta luminosities, which implies that one of the main sources\nof dust heating in star-forming galaxies is ionising UV radiation of young\nstars. Using the relation between warm and cold dust masses for estimating the\ntotal dust mass in star-forming galaxies with an accuracy better than ~0.5 dex\nis proposed. On the other hand, it is shown for both samples that dust\ntemperatures do not depend on the metallicities. The dust-to-neutral gas mass\nratio strongly declines with decreasing metallicity, similar to that found in\nother studies of local emission-line galaxies, high-redshift GRB hosts, and\nDLAs. On the other hand, the dust-to-ionised gas mass ratio is about one\nhundred times as high implying that most of dust is located in the neutral gas.\nIt is found that thermal free-free emission of ionised gas in compact\nstar-forming galaxies might be responsible for the sub-mm emission excess.

Even if we include radiative cooling in\nlateral directions out of the disk plane into our model (thereby breaking\nstrict plane-parallel geometry) we find that for a realistic vertical extent of\nthe solar nebula disk the temperature decline is not fast enough. On the other\nhand, if we assume that the shock is entirely optically thin so that particles\ncan radiate freely, the cooling rates are too high to produce the observed\nchondrules textures. Global nebular shocks are therefore problematic as the\nprimary sources of chondrules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 13:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-21"}

The\ndomain is partitioned using a 1D slab decomposition, and global communication\nis performed using a sparse communication pattern. Operations in the spatial\nfrequency domain are performed in transposed space to reduce the communication\nburden imposed by the 3D fast Fourier transform.

In this direction, the interference among the data\nstreams is transformed under certain conditions to useful signal that can\nimprove the signal to interference noise ratio (SINR) of the downlink\ntransmissions.

We showed\nthat the resonance survives the weak and short-range interaction. The latter\ndetunes it and as a result shifts the Zeeman splitting at which the minimum in\nspin polarization occurs. Here this shift is attributed to the absence of Kohn\ntheorem for the spin sloshing collective mode.
