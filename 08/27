This relation is\noften interpreted in terms of the Rossby number, i.e., the ratio of rotation\nperiod to convective overturn time. We reconsider this interpretation on the\nbasis of the observed X-ray emission and rotation periods of 821 stars with\nmasses below 1.4 Msun. A generalized analysis of the relation between X-ray\nluminosity normalized by bolometric luminosity, L_X/L_bol, and combinations of\nrotational period, P, and stellar radius, R, shows that the Rossby formulation\ndoes not provide the solution with minimal scatter. Instead, we find that the\nrelation L_X/L_bol ~ P^{-2}R^{-4} optimally describes the non-saturated\nfraction of the stars. This relation is equivalent to L_X ~ P^{-2}, indicating\nthat the rotation period alone determines the total X-ray emission. Since L_X\nis directly related to the magnetic flux at the stellar surface, this means\nthat the surface flux is determined solely by the star's rotation and is\nindependent of other stellar parameters. While a formulation in terms of a\nRossby number would be consistent with these results if the convective overturn\ntime scales exactly as L_bol^{-1/2}, our generalized approach emphasizes the\nneed to test a broader range of mechanisms for dynamo action in cool stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 16:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The model is based on\nthe assumption that the implicit solvent interacts on a fast time scale with\nthe monomers of the chain compared to the time scale for structural\nrearrangements of the chain and provides sufficient friction so that the motion\nof monomers is governed by the Smoluchowski equation. A microscopic theory for\nthe dynamics of the system is developed that reduces to a Markovian model of\nthe kinetics under well-defined conditions. Microscopic expressions for the\nrate constants that appear in the Markov state model are analyzed and expressed\nin terms of a temperature-dependent linear combination of escape rates that\nthemselves are independent of temperature.

The precise nature\nof the progenitor, however, remains debated owing to spectral ambiguities\narising from a strong contribution from the CSM interaction. Late-time spectra\noffer potential insight if the post-shock cold, dense shell becomes\nsufficiently thin and/or the ejecta begin to cross the reverse shock. To date,\nfew high-quality spectra of this kind exist. Here we report on the late-time\noptical and infrared spectra of the SNe~Ia-CSM 2012ca and 2013dn. These SNe\nIa-CSM spectra exhibit low [Fe III]/[Fe II] ratios and strong [Ca II] at late\nepochs. Such characteristics are reminiscent of the super-Chandrasekhar-mass\n(SC) candidate SN 2009dc, for which these features suggested a low-ionisation\nstate due to high densities, although the broad Fe features admittedly show\nsimilarities to the blue \"quasi-continuum\" observed in some core-collapse SNe\nIbn and IIn. Neither SN 2012ca nor any of the other SNe Ia-CSM show evidence\nfor broad oxygen, carbon, or magnesium in their spectra. Similar to the\ninteracting Type IIn SN 2005ip, a number of high-ionisation lines are\nidentified in SN 2012ca, including [S III], [Ar III], [Ar X], [Fe VIII], [Fe\nX], and possibly [Fe XI]. The total bolometric energy output does not exceed\n10^51 erg, but does require a large kinetic-to-radiative conversion efficiency.\nAll of these observations taken together suggest that SNe Ia-CSM are more\nconsistent with a thermonuclear explosion than a core-collapse event, although\ndetailed radiative transfer models are certainly necessary to confirm these\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 20:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

However, our results\nindicate that introducing the dephasing in the disordered chains leads to the\nweakening of the localization effects, arising from the randomness, and then\nincreases the efficiency of quantum energy transfer. Thus, the presence of\nnoise is crucial for the enhancement of EET efficiency in disordered chains. We\nalso show that the contribution of both classical and quantum mechanical\neffects are required to improve the speed of energy transfer along the chain.\nOur analysis may help for better understanding of fast and efficient\nfunctioning of the selectivity filters in ion channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 20:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2014 19:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-25"}

The calculations will employ realistic chiral nucleon-nucleon\npotentials with the inclusion of three-body forces and self-energy effects.\n  Methods: The superfluid states of neutron and nuclear matter are studied by\nsolving the BCS gap equation for chiral nuclear potentials using the method\nsuggested by Khodel et al., where the original gap equation is replaced by a\ncoupled set of equations for the dimensionless gap function $\\chi(p)$ defined\nby $\\Delta(p) = \\Delta_F \\chi(p)$ and a non-linear algebraic equation for the\ngap magnitude $\\Delta_F = \\Delta(p_F)$ at the Fermi surface.

The gold standard for\nInfluence Maximization is the greedy algorithm, which iteratively adds to the\nseed set a node maximizing the marginal gain in influence. Greedy has a\nguaranteed approximation ratio of at least (1-1/e) and actually produces a\nsequence of nodes, with each prefix having approximation guarantee with respect\nto the same-size optimum. Since Greedy does not scale well beyond a few million\nedges, for larger inputs one must currently use either heuristics or\nalternative algorithms designed for a pre-specified small seed set size.\n  We develop a novel sketch-based design for influence computation.

Our\napproach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space with\neffective temperatures between 500 K and 1100 K. In all of these worlds\nequilibrium chemistry favors CH4 over CO in the parts of the atmosphere that\ncan be seen from Earth, but in most disequilibrium favors CO. The small surface\ngravity of a planet strongly discriminates against CH4 when compared to an\notherwise comparable brown dwarf. If vertical mixing is like Jupiter's, the\ntransition from methane to CO occurs at 500 K in a planet. Sluggish vertical\nmixing can raise this to 600 K; but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing\ncould lower this to 400 K. The comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are\n$1100\\pm100$ K. Ammonia is also sensitive to gravity, but unlike CH4/CO, the\nNH3/N2 ratio is insensitive to mixing, which makes NH3 a potential proxy for\ngravity. HCN may become interesting in high gravity brown dwarfs with very\nstrong vertical mixing. Detailed analysis of the CO-CH4 reaction network\nreveals that the bottleneck to CO hydrogenation goes through methanol, in\npartial agreement with previous work. Simple, easy to use quenching relations\nare derived by fitting to the complete chemistry of the full ensemble of\nmodels. These relations are valid for determining CO, CH4, NH3, HCN, and CO2\nabundances in the range of self-luminous worlds we have studied but may not\napply if atmospheres are strongly heated at high altitudes by processes not\nconsidered here (e.g., wave breaking).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 23:48:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 23:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Leveraging a pricing model from prior\nwork, we develop algorithms to optimally set and then vary price over time in\norder to meet a (a) user-specified deadline while minimizing total monetary\ncost (b) user-specified monetary budget constraint while minimizing total\nelapsed time. We leverage techniques from decision theory (specifically, Markov\nDecision Processes) for both these problems, and demonstrate that our\ntechniques lead to upto 30\\% reduction in cost over schemes proposed in prior\nwork. Furthermore, we develop techniques to speed-up the computation, enabling\nusers to leverage the price setting algorithms on-the-fly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 02:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-28"}

Whilst maintaining\nsimilar coverage and conformity, plans at different IDLs were evaluated in\nterms of normal tissue sparing using the proposed DDS. The DDS was defined as\nthe greater decay coefficient in a double exponential decay fit of the dose\ndrop-off outside the PTV, which models the steep portion of the drop-off.\nProvided that the prescription dose covers the whole PTV, a greater DDS\nindicates better normal tissue sparing.

We\nassume a piecewise constant model for these parameters, with an unknown number\nof change-points and hence a trans-dimensional parameter space over which we\nseek to perform Bayesian inference. We propose two novel ideas to deal with the\ncomputational challenges of such inference.

Instead, in this paper\nwe start from a parametrised definition of social intelligence as the expected\nperformance in a set of environments with several agents, and we assess and\nderive tests from it. This definition makes several dependencies explicit: (1)\nthe definition depends on the choice (and weight) of environments and agents,\n(2) the definition may include both competitive and cooperative behaviours\ndepending on how agents and rewards are arranged into teams, (3) the definition\nmostly depends on the abilities of other agents, and (4) the actual difference\nbetween social intelligence and general intelligence (or other abilities)\ndepends on these choices. As a result, we address the problem of converting\nthis definition into a more precise one where some fundamental properties\nensuring social behaviour (such as action and reward dependency and\nanticipation on competitive/cooperative behaviours) are met as well as some\nother more instrumental properties (such as secernment, boundedness, symmetry,\nvalidity, reliability, efficiency), which are convenient to convert the\ndefinition into a practical test.

The study of the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) in relation to\nthe galaxy environment and the stellar mass density profile, rho(r), is a\npowerful tool to constrain models of galaxy evolution.

We determine the\nSMF of the z=0.44 cluster of galaxies MACS J1206.2-0847 separately for passive\nand star-forming (SF) galaxies, in different regions of the cluster, from the\ncenter out to approximately 2 virial radii.

The whole\ncluster SMF is well fitted by a double Schechter function. The SMFs of cluster\nSF and passive galaxies are statistically different. The SMF of the SF cluster\ngalaxies does not depend on the environment. The SMF of the passive population\nhas a significantly smaller slope (in absolute value) in the innermost (<0.50\nMpc), highest density cluster region, than in more external, lower density\nregions. The number ratio of giant/subgiant galaxies is maximum in this\ninnermost region and minimum in the adjacent region, but then gently increases\nagain toward the cluster outskirts.

It is based on a calculus of rewrite rules, the soundness of which rests\nupon the way in which algebras embed into their canonical extensions and the\norder-theoretic properties of the latter. We show that the algorithm succeeds\non every restricted inductive inequality by means of a so-called proper run,\nand that this is sufficient to guarantee their canonicity. Likewise, we are\nable to show that the algorithm succeeds on every tame inductive inequality by\nmeans of a so-called tame run. In turn, this guarantees their tame canonicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 09:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-28"}

Especially eddy currents caused by time-varying magnetic\nperturbations and halo currents flowing directly from the plasma into the walls\nare important. The relevance of a resistive wall model is directly evident for\nResistive Wall Modes (RWMs) or Vertical Displacement Events (VDEs). However,\nalso the linear and non-linear properties of most other large-scale\ninstabilities may be influenced significantly by the interaction with currents\nin conducting structures near the plasma. The understanding of halo currents\narising during disruptions and VDEs, which are a serious concern for ITER as\nthey may lead to strong asymmetric forces on vessel structures, could also\nbenefit strongly from these non-linear modeling capabilities. Modeling the\nplasma dynamics and its interaction with wall currents requires solving the\nmagneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations in realistic toroidal X-point geometry\nconsistently coupled with a model for the vacuum region and the resistive\nconducting structures.

The new BayeSED\ncode has been systematically tested on a mock sample of galaxies. The\ncomparison between estimated and inputted value of the parameters show that\nBayeSED can recover the physical parameters of galaxies reasonably well. We\nthen applied BayeSED to interpret the SEDs of a large Ks-selected sample of\ngalaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field with stellar population synthesis\nmodels. With the new BayeSED code, a Bayesian model comparison of stellar\npopulation synthesis models has been done for the first time. We found that the\nmodel by Bruzual & Charlot (2003), statistically speaking, has larger Bayesian\nevidence than the model by Maraston (2005) for the Ks-selected sample. Besides,\nwhile setting the stellar metallicity as a free parameter obviously increases\nthe Bayesian evidence of both models, varying the IMF has a notable effect only\non the Maraston (2005) model. Meanwhile, the physical parameters estimated with\nBayeSED are found to be generally consistent with those obtained with the\npopular grid-based FAST code, while the former exhibits more natural\ndistributions. Based on the estimated physical parameters of galaxies in the\nsample, we qualitatively classified the galaxies in the sample into five\npopulations that may represent galaxies at different evolution stages or in\ndifferent environments.

The parametric OH - SB\nrelation reproduces the observed data better than a simple, one-parameter\nrelation; the deviations resulting when using our parametric relation are\nsmaller by a factor of ~1.4 than that the simple relation.

Assuming\nthat the channel is known to the receivers only, we show that BIA can achieve\n$\\frac{2K}{K+2}$ DoF, which surpasses the sum DoF achieved by previously known\ninterference alignment schemes with delayed channel state information at\ntransmitters (CSIT). This result implies that the sum DoF is upper bounded by\n2, which means that the best we can do with BIA is to double the DoF achieved\nby orthogonal multiple access schemes. Moreover, we propose an algorithm to\ngenerate the transmit beamforming vectors and the reconfigurable antenna\nswitching patterns, and apply this algorithm to the 4-user SISO Interference\nChannel, showing that $\\frac{4}{3}$ sum DoF is achievable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 14:51:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2014 06:59:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 May 2016 03:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

This phenomenon has been studied for more than\n15 years, but most of the literatures studied software as a black box, none of\nthem uncovered the fundamental and widely accepted mechanism of software aging\nas far as we know. Through analyzing the characteristics between biological\naging and software aging, we find some interesting common points and bridge the\ngap between these two seemingly unrelated phenomena. The free radical aging\ntheory in biological studies is also applicative to explore the mechanism and\nmodel of software aging. This paper finds an equivalent concept named `software\nfree radical' in software aging to free radical in biological aging. In our\nstudy, the accumulation of `software free radical' is a root cause of software\naging. Using the free radical modeling methodology in biological aging, we give\na model for describing the kinetic of software aging based on feedback loops.\nAlthough this paper doesn't give enough theoretical proof of the modeling\nmethod, the practical results show that the feedback loop model can describe\nthe kinetic of software aging precisely. To further validate the aging\nmechanism, we propose several software rejuvenation strategies focusing on\ncleaning the `software free radical'. The results show that software aging can\nbe mitigated effectively by strengthening negative feedback loop or weakening\npositive feedback loop. This paper is the first try to answer the question `How\nsoftware ages' through interdisciplinary studies. Leveraging the conclusions in\nthis paper, people can design better software systems or keep their systems at\na high performance level during long time running.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Aug 2014 01:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-04"}
