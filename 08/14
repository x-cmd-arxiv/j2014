The radius-mass relation\nfor these models is sufficiently specific that it could be subjected to an\nobservational test with future X-ray observatories. We want to study the impact\nof the presence of hyperon cores on the radius-mass relation for NS. We aim to\nfind out how, and for which particular stellar mass range, a specific relation\nR(M), where M is the gravitational mass, and R is the circumferential radius,\nis associated with the presence of a hyperon core.\n  We consider a set of 14 theoretical EOS of dense matter, based on the\nrelativistic mean-field (RMF) approximation, allowing for the presence of\nhyperons in NSs. We seek correlations between R(M) and the stiffness of the EOS\nbelow the hyperon threshold needed to pass the 2 Msun test. For NS masses\n1.0<M/Msun<1.6, we get R>13km, because of a very stiff pre-hyperon segment of\nthe EOS. At nuclear density, the pressure is significantly higher than a robust\nupper bound obtained recently using chiral effective field theory.\n  If massive NSs do have a sizable hyperon core, then according to current\nmodels the radii for M=1.0-1.6 Msun are necessarily >13km. If, on the contrary,\na NS with a radius R<12 km is observed in this mass domain, then sizable\nhyperon cores in NSs, as we model them now, are ruled out. Future X-ray\nmissions with <5% precision for a simultaneous M and R measurement will have\nthe potential to solve the problem with observations of NSs. Irrespective of\nthis observational test, present EOS allowing for hyperons that fulfill\ncondition M_max>2 Msun yield a pressure at nuclear density that is too high\nrelative to up-to-date microscopic calculations of this quantity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 16:51:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 May 2015 14:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-26"}

Inspired by observations of these\nmultipole asymmetries in terms of two-point correlations and variance in real\nspace, we demonstrate that this model can explain the observed anomalous power\nasymmetry of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) sky, including its\ncharacteristic feature that the dipole dominates over higher multipoles. We\ntest the viability of the model and place approximate constraints on its\nparameters by using observational values of dipole, quadrupole, and octopole\namplitudes of the asymmetry measured by a local-variance estimator. We find\nthat a configuration of the model in which the CMB sphere does not intersect\nthe domain wall during inflation provides a good fit to the data.

In this paper,\nwe overcome this difficulty by proposing Fastfood, an approximation that\naccelerates such computation significantly. Key to Fastfood is the observation\nthat Hadamard matrices, when combined with diagonal Gaussian matrices, exhibit\nproperties similar to dense Gaussian random matrices. Yet unlike the latter,\nHadamard and diagonal matrices are inexpensive to multiply and store. These two\nmatrices can be used in lieu of Gaussian matrices in Random Kitchen Sinks\nproposed by Rahimi and Recht (2009) and thereby speeding up the computation for\na large range of kernel functions. Specifically, Fastfood requires O(n log d)\ntime and O(n) storage to compute n non-linear basis functions in d dimensions,\na significant improvement from O(nd) computation and storage, without\nsacrificing accuracy.\n  Our method applies to any translation invariant and any dot-product kernel,\nsuch as the popular RBF kernels and polynomial kernels. We prove that the\napproximation is unbiased and has low variance. Experiments show that we\nachieve similar accuracy to full kernel expansions and Random Kitchen Sinks\nwhile being 100x faster and using 1000x less memory.

In this study,\nwe compute the critical value of such a flux ($J_{21}^{\\rm crit}$) for\nrealistic spectra of Pop II stars through three-dimensional cosmological\nsimulations. We derive the dependence of $J_{21}^{\\rm crit}$ on the radiation\nspectra, on variations from halo to halo, and on the impact of X-ray\nionization.

In this work,\nNb-Al-ALD-Al2O3-Nb trilayers with tunnel barriers from 0.6 - 1.6 nm were grown\nin situ. Nb-Al-AlOx-Nb JJs with thermally oxidized tunnel barrier were produced\nfor reference. RN was obtained using a four-point method at 300 K. JC, and its\ndependence on barrier thickness, was calculated from the Ambegaokar-Baratoff\nformula. The Al surface was modeled using ab initio molecular dynamics to study\nthe nucleation of Al2O3 on Al. Current voltage characteristics were taken at 4\nK to corroborate the room temperature measurements. Together, these results\nsuggest that ALD may be used to grow an ultrathin, uniform tunnel barrier with\ncontrollable tunnel resistance and JC, but a thin IL develops during the\nnucleation stage of ALD growth that may disqualify Al as a suitable wetting\nlayer for ALD JJ based qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 18:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-14"}

In this paper, we consider a\ngraphene M\\\"obius band irradiated with circularly polarised light.\nInterestingly, due to the non-orientability of the M\\\"obius band, a homogeneous\nquantum Hall effect cannot exist in this system, but the quantum spin Hall\neffect can. To avoid this restriction, the irradiation is applied in a\nlongitudinal-domain-wall configuration. In this way, the periodic\ntime-dependent driving term tends to generate the quantum anomalous Hall\neffect. On the other hand, due to the bent geometry of the M\\\"obius band, we\nexpect a strong spin-orbit coupling, which may lead to quantum spin Hall-like\ntopological states. Here, we investigate the competition between these two\nphenomena upon varying the amplitude and the frequency of the light, for a\nfixed value of the spin-orbit coupling strength. The topological properties are\nanalysed by identifying the edge states in the Floquet spectrum at intermediate\nfrequencies, when there are resonances between the light frequency and the\nenergy difference between the conduction and valence bands of the graphene\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 19:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-10"}

The appearance of magnetism in oxygen-deficient\nSTO is not determined solely by the presence of a single oxygen vacancy but by\nthe density of free carriers and the relative proximity of the vacant sites. We\nfind that while an isolated vacancy behaves as a non-magnetic double donor,\nmanipulation of the doping conditions allows the stability of a single donor\nstate, with emergent local moments coupled ferromagnetically by carriers in the\nconduction band. Strong local lattice distortions enhance the binding of this\nstate. The energy of the in-gap local moment can be further tuned by\northorhombic strain. Consequently we find that the free-carrier density and\nstrain are fundamental components to obtaining trapped spin-polarized electrons\nin oxygen-deficient STO, which may have important implications in the design of\noptical devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 19:51:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Aug 2014 20:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

A next-generation\nsurvey with volume $V = 25 h^{-3}$Gpc$^3$, median redshift $z = 0.7$ and mean\nbias $b_g = 2.5$, can achieve $\\sigma(f_{NL}) = 6$, $\\sigma(g_{NL}) = 10^5$ and\n$\\sigma(\\tau_{NL}) = 10^3$ if no mass information is available. If halo masses\nare available, we show that optimally weighting the halo field in order to\nreduce sample variance can achieve $\\sigma(f_{NL}) = 1.5$, $\\sigma(g_{NL}) =\n10^4$ and $\\sigma(\\tau_{NL}) = 100$ if halos with mass down to $M_{min} =\n10^{11}$ $h^{-1} M_\\odot $ are resolved, outperforming Planck by a factor of 4\non $f_{NL}$ and nearly an order of magnitude on $g_{NL}$ and $\\tau_{NL}$.\nFinally, we study the effect of photometric redshift errors and discuss\ndegeneracies between different non-Gaussian parameters, as well as the impact\nof marginalizing Gaussian bias and shot noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 20:03:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 19:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

In order to understand such varieties, it is important\nto extend the materials basis beyond the usual setting of intermetallic\ncompounds.

The\nexistence of even a single Dirac magnetic monopole would have far-reaching\nphysical consequences, most famously explaining the quantization of electric\ncharge. Although analogues of magnetic monopoles have been found in exotic\nspin-ices and other systems, there has been no direct experimental observation\nof Dirac monopoles within a medium described by a quantum field, such as\nsuperfluid helium-3.

We then obtain a fast (nearly\nlinear in the dimension of the matrix) algorithm for the application of the\nabsorbing boundary condition using partitioned low rank matrices. The result,\nmodulo a precomputation, is a fast and memory-efficient compression scheme of\nan absorbing boundary condition for the Helmholtz equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 21:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-15"}

In this paper, we consider\ndistributed cooperative sensing (DCS) in which secondary users (SUs) exchange\ndata with one another instead of reporting to a common fusion center. In most\nexisting DCS algorithms, the SUs are grouped into disjoint cooperative groups\nor coalitions, and within each coalition the local sensing data is exchanged.\nHowever, these schemes do not account for the possibility that an SU can be\ninvolved in multiple cooperative coalitions thus forming overlapping\ncoalitions.

Describing this evolution is the aim of the surface flux\ntransport model. The model starts from the emergence of magnetic bipoles.\nThereafter, the model is based on the induction equation and the fact that\nafter emergence the magnetic field is observed to evolve as if it were purely\nradial. The induction equation then describes how the surface flows --\ndifferential rotation, meridional circulation, granular, supergranular flows,\nand active region inflows -- determine the evolution of the field (now taken to\nbe purely radial). In this paper, we review the modeling of the various\nprocesses that determine the evolution of the surface field. We restrict our\nattention to their role in the surface flux transport model.

As\na show case, we implement our method in RICH, a 2D moving mesh hydrodynamical\ncode, but it can be extended trivially to other codes in 2D or 3D. Our tests\nshow that this method is indeed efficient and can be used in a large variety of\nexisting hydrodynamical codes as well as other applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 05:42:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 06:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We\ndevelop a distributed power splitting framework using game theory to derive a\nprofile of power splitting ratios for all relays that can achieve a good\nnetwork-wide performance. Specifically, non-cooperative games are respectively\nformulated for pure amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF)\nnetworks, in which each link is modeled as a strategic player who aims to\nmaximize its own achievable rate. The existence and uniqueness for the Nash\nequilibriums (NEs) of the formulated games are analyzed and a distributed\nalgorithm with provable convergence to achieve the NEs is also developed.\nSubsequently, the developed framework is extended to the more general network\nsetting with mixed AF and DF relays.

While the\npower consumption and speed dominance of such an NPU over von Neumann\narchitectures for machine learning applications is well appreciated,\nThermodynamic-RAM offers several advantages over other hardware approaches to\nadaptation and learning. Benefits include general-purpose use, a simple yet\nflexible instruction set and easy integration into existing digital platforms.\nWe present a high level design of kT-RAM and a formal definition of its\ninstruction set. We report the completion of a kT-RAM emulator and the\nsuccessful port of all previous machine learning benchmark applications\nincluding unsupervised clustering, supervised and unsupervised classification,\ncomplex signal prediction, unsupervised robotic actuation and combinatorial\noptimization. Lastly, we extend a previous MNIST hand written digits benchmark\napplication, to show that an extra step of reading the synaptic states of AHaH\nnodes during the train phase (healing) alone results in plasticity that\nimproves the classifier's performance, bumping our best F1 score up to 99.5%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 08:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-15"}

The contribution of this paper is\nin exploring the problem of computer-automated suggestion of influences between\nartists, a problem that was not addressed before in a general setting.

Understanding the extent and the form that these\nevolutionary constraints may take is important to interpret the information in\nprotein sequences. To study this problem, we introduce a simple but physical\nmodel of protein evolution where selection targets allostery, the functional\ncoupling of distal sites on protein surfaces. This model shows how the\ngeometrical organization of couplings between amino acids within a protein\nstructure can depend crucially on its evolutionary history. In particular, two\nscenarios are found to generate a spatial concentration of functional\nconstraints: high mutation rates and fluctuating selective pressures. This\nsecond scenario offers a plausible explanation for the high tolerance of\nnatural proteins to mutations and for the spatial organization of their least\ntolerant amino acids, as revealed by sequence analyses and mutagenesis\nexperiments. It also implies a faculty to adapt to new selective pressures that\nis consistent with observations. Besides, the model illustrates how several\nindependent functional modules may emerge within a same protein structure,\ndepending on the nature of past environmental fluctuations. Our model thus\nrelates the evolutionary history and evolutionary potential of proteins to the\ngeometry of their functional constraints, with implications for decoding and\nengineering protein sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 10:17:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In particular, we\naccount for a variation of the birth-death process (which can also be regarded\nas a proportional imitation rule from social point of view) for the strategy\nupdating under both weak- and strong-selection (meaning the payoffs harvested\nfrom games contribute either slightly or heavily to the individuals'\nperformance). By implementing comparative studies, where the players are\nselected either randomly or in terms of their actual activities to playing\ngames with their immediate neighbors, we figure out that heterogeneous activity\nbenefits the emergence of collective cooperation in harsh environment (the\naction for cooperation is costly) under strong selection, while it impairs the\nformation of altruism under weak selection. Moreover, we find that the\nabundance of communities in the social network can evidently foster the\nfixation of cooperation under strong-selection, in contrast to the games\nevolving on the randomized counterparts. Our results are therefore helpful for\nus to better understand the evolution of cooperation in real social systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 13:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

Despite an age of only 2Myr and a\nsimilarity with prototypical classical T Tauri stars, LkCa4 shows no evidence\nfor accretion and probes an interesting transition stage for star and planet\nformation. Large profile distortions and Zeeman signatures are detected in the\nunpolarized and circularly-polarized lines of LkCa4 using Least-Squares\nDeconvolution (LSD), indicating the presence of brightness inhomogeneities and\nmagnetic fields at the surface of LkCa4.\n  Using tomographic imaging, we reconstruct brightness and magnetic maps of\nLkCa4 from sets of unpolarized and circularly-polarized LSD profiles. The\nlarge-scale field is strong and mainly axisymmetric, featuring a ~2kG poloidal\ncomponent and a ~1kG toroidal component encircling the star at equatorial\nlatitudes - the latter making LkCa4 markedly different from classical TTauri\nstars of similar mass and age. The brightness map includes a dark spot\noverlapping the magnetic pole and a bright region at mid latitudes - providing\na good match to the contemporaneous photometry. We also find that differential\nrotation at the surface of LkCa4 is small, typically ~5.5x weaker than that of\nthe Sun, and compatible with solid-body rotation.\n  Using our tomographic modelling, we are able to filter out the activity\njitter in the RV curve of LkCa4 (of full amplitude 4.3km/s) down to a rms\nprecision of 0.055km/s. Looking for hot Jupiters around young Sun-like stars\nthus appears feasible, even though we find no evidence for such planets around\nLkCa4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 13:24:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Aug 2014 10:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

However the best empirical potential\nand best ab initio potential for the ground electronic state to date give\ndrastically different predictions in the long-range region beyond which\nmeasurements have been made, which is about \\sim1000 cm^{-1} for ^{9} BeH,\n\\sim3000 cm^{-1} for ^{9} BeD, and \\sim13000 cm^{-1} for ^{9} BeT. Improved\nempirical potentials and Born-Oppenheimer breakdown corrections have now been\nbuilt for the ground electronic states X(1^{2}\\Sigma^{+}) of all three\nisotopologues. The predicted dissociation energy for ^{9} BeH from the new\nempirical potential is now closer to the current best ab initio prediction by\nmore than 66% of the discrepancy between the latter and the previous best\nempirical potential. The previous best empirical potential predicted the\nexistence of unobserved vibrational levels for all three isotopologues, and the\ncurrent best ab initio study also predicted the existence of all of these\nlevels, and four more. The present empirical potential agrees with the ab\ninitio prediction of all of these extra levels not predicted by the earlier\nempirical potential. With one exception, all energy spacings between\nvibrational energy levels for which measurements have been made, are predicted\nwith an agreement of better than 1 cm^{-1} between the new empirical potential\nand the current best ab initio potential, but some predictions for unobserved\nlevels are still in great disagreement, and the equilibrium bond lengths are\ndifferent by orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Aug 2014 18:40:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

We propose that the reason behind this\nremarkable property is the loss of causal connectivity across these jets,\ncaused by their rapid expansion in response to fast decline of external\npressure with the distance from the \"jet engine\". In atmospheres with power-law\npressure distribution, the total loss of causal connectivity occurs, when the\npower index k>2 - the steepness which is expected to be quite common for many\nastrophysical environments. This conclusion does not seem to depend on the\nphysical nature of jets - it applies both to relativistic and non-relativistic\nflows, both magnetically-dominated and unmagnetized jets. In order to verify\nit, we have carried out numerical simulations of moderately magnetized and\nmoderately relativistic jets. Their results give strong support to our\nhypothesis and provide with valuable insights. In particular, we find that the\nz-pinched inner cores of magnetic jets expand slower than their envelopes and\nbecome susceptible to instabilities even when the whole jet is stable. This may\nresult in local dissipation and emission without global disintegration of the\nflow. Cosmic jets may become globally unstable when they enter flat sections of\nexternal atmospheres. We propose that the Fanaroff-Riley morphological division\nof extragalactic radio sources into two classes is related to this issue. In\nparticular, we argue that the low power FR-I jets become re-confined, causally\nconnected and globally unstable on the scale of galactic X-ray coronas, whereas\nmore powerful FR-II jets re-confine much further out and remain largely intact\nuntil they terminate at hot spots. Using this idea, we derived the relationship\nbetween the critical jet power and the optical luminosity of the host galaxy,\nwhich is in a very good agreement with the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 15:33:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 11:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-06"}
