Variance based probes such as the C and F tests, or a\ncombination of both, are popular methods to compare the light-curves of the\nquasar and a comparison star. Recently, detection claims in some studies depend\non the agreement of the results of the C and F tests, or of two instances of\nthe F-test, in rejecting the non-variation null hypothesis. However, the C-test\nis a non-reliable statistical procedure, the F-test is not robust, and the\ncombination of tests with concurrent results is anything but a straightforward\nmethodology. A priori Power Analysis calculations and post hoc analysis of\nMonte-Carlo simulations show excellent agreement for the Analysis of Variance\ntest to detect microvariations, as well as the limitations of the F-test.\nAdditionally, combined tests yield correlated probabilities that make the\nassessment of statistical significance unworkable.

The constraints depend crucially on the capture rate which, in turn, is\ndetermined by the energy loss by a PBH passing through a NS. Two alternative\napproaches to estimate the energy loss have been used in the literature: the\none based on the dynamical friction mechanism, and another on tidal\ndeformations of the NS by the PBH. The second mechanism was claimed to be more\nefficient by several orders of magnitude due to the excitation of particular\noscillation modes reminiscent of the surface waves. We address this\ndisagreement by considering a simple analytically solvable model that consists\nof a flat incompressible fluid in an external gravitational field. In this\nmodel, we calculate the energy loss by a PBH traversing the fluid surface. We\nfind that the excitation of modes with the propagation velocity smaller than\nthat of PBH is suppressed, which implies that in a realistic situation of a\nsupersonic PBH the large contributions from the surface waves are absent and\nthe above two approaches lead to consistent expressions for the energy loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2014 16:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

Previous work proved that as $n \\to\n\\infty$ the distribution of the number of summands in the Zeckendorf\ndecompositions of $m \\in [F_n, F_{n+1})$, appropriately normalized, converges\nto the standard normal. The proofs crucially used the fact that all integers in\n$[F_n, F_{n+1})$ share the same potential summands.\n  We generalize these results to subintervals of $[F_n, F_{n+1})$ as $n \\to\n\\infty$; the analysis is significantly more involved here as different integers\nhave different sets of potential summands. Explicitly, fix an integer sequence\n$\\alpha(n) \\to \\infty$. As $n \\to \\infty$, for almost all $m \\in [F_n,\nF_{n+1})$ the distribution of the number of summands in the Zeckendorf\ndecompositions of integers in the subintervals $[m, m + F_{\\alpha(n)})$,\nappropriately normalized, converges to the standard normal. The proof follows\nby showing that, with probability tending to $1$, $m$ has at least one\nappropriately located large gap between indices in its decomposition. We then\nuse a correspondence between this interval and $[0, F_{\\alpha(n)})$ to obtain\nthe result, since the summands are known to have Gaussian behavior in the\nlatter interval. % We also prove the same result for more general linear\nrecurrences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2014 17:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-02"}

The crucial spectral features in the\nglobal 21 cm signal (turning points) occur at low radio frequencies <100 MHz.\nIn addition to the human-generated RFI, Earth's ionosphere drastically corrupts\nlow-frequency radio observations from the ground. In this paper, we examine the\neffects of time-varying ionospheric refraction, absorption and thermal emission\nat these low radio frequencies and their combined effect on any ground-based\nglobal 21 cm experiment. It should be noted that this is the first study of the\neffect of a dynamic ionosphere on global 21 cm experiments. The fluctuations in\nthe ionosphere are influenced by solar activity with flicker noise\ncharacteristics. The same characteristics are reflected in the ionospheric\ncorruption to any radio signal passing through the ionosphere. As a result, any\nground based observations of the faint global 21 cm signal are corrupted by\nflicker noise (or \"$1/f$\" noise, where \"$f$\" is the dynamical frequency) which\nscales as $\\nu^{-2}$ (where $\\nu$ is the frequency of observation) in the\npresence of a bright galactic foreground ($\\propto \\nu^{-s}$, where $s$ is\nradio spectral index). Hence, the calibration of the ionosphere for any such\nexperiment is critical. Any attempt to calibrate the ionospheric effects will\nbe subject to the inaccuracies in the current ionospheric measurements using\nGPS ionospheric measurements, riometer measurements, ionospheric soundings,\netc. Even considering an optimistic improvement in the accuracy of GPS-TEC\n(Total Electron Content) measurements, we conclude that the detection of the\nglobal 21 cm signal below 100 MHz is best done from above the Earth's\natmosphere in orbit of the Moon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2014 19:23:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2015 19:16:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 18:37:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 21:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-11"}

Because\ngravitational waves (GWs) are almost impossible to obscure via dust absorption\nor other astrophysical processes, the strength of the detected signal is\ndictated solely by the emission strength and the distance to the source.\nAssuming that the space density of an arbitrary population of GW sources does\nnot evolve, we show explicitly that the distribution of detected\nsignal-to-noise (SNR) values depends solely on the detection threshold; it is\nindependent of the detector network (interferometer or pulsar timing array),\nthe individual detector noise curves (initial or Advanced LIGO), the nature of\nthe GW sources (compact binary coalescence, supernova, or some other discrete\nsource), and the distributions of source variables (only non-spinning neutron\nstars of mass exactly $1.4\\,M_\\odot$ or a complicated distribution of masses\nand spins).

A natural question arises, whether such an impressive\nenhancement persists when one takes into account the decoherence effects that\nare unavoidable in any real-life implementation. In this thesis, we resolve a\nmajor part of this issue by describing general techniques that allow to\nquantify the attainable precision in metrological schemes in the presence of\nuncorrelated noise. We show that the abstract geometrical structure of a\nquantum channel describing the noisy evolution of a single particle dictates\nthen critical bounds on the ultimate quantum enhancement.

The overall\ncomputational scheme is put in relationship with alternative approximation\nalgorithms in the literature, and finally its performance is practically\nassessed over a benchmark case study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2014 20:03:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2015 20:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-11"}

A set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate the\nphysical soundness of the results. Each methodology is judged against the\nbenchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameter\nspace. The final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from the\nindividual methods.

One issue associated with NADEs is that they rely on a\nparticular order of factorization for $P(\\mathbf{x})$. This issue has been\nrecently addressed by a variant of NADE called Orderless NADEs and its deeper\nversion, Deep Orderless NADE. Orderless NADEs are trained based on a criterion\nthat stochastically maximizes $P(\\mathbf{x})$ with all possible orders of\nfactorizations. Unfortunately, ancestral sampling from deep NADE is very\nexpensive, corresponding to running through a neural net separately predicting\neach of the visible variables given some others.

Two different\nversions of the method are described; a time-constant model error treatment\nwhere the same model error statistical description is time-invariant, and a\ntime-varying treatment where the assumed model error statistics is randomly\nsampled at each analysis step. We compare both methods with the standard method\nof dealing with model error through inflation and localization, and illustrate\nour results with numerical simulations on a low order nonlinear system\nexhibiting chaotic dynamics. The results show that the filter skill is\nsignificantly improved through the proposed model error treatments, and that\nboth methods require far less parameter tuning than the standard approach.\nFurthermore, the proposed approach is simple to implement within a pre-existing\nensemble based scheme. The general implications for the use of the proposed\napproach in the framework of square-root filters such as the ETKF are also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 01:51:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-03"}

A full understanding\nof the physical mechanisms which govern the kinetic plasma dynamics at these\nscales can provide important clues on the problem of the turbulent dissipation\nand heating in collisionless systems.

The\nmain objects of interest are the closely related concepts of excitation\nspectrum and quasiparticles.

In the first\npart of this thesis we discuss the concepts of excitation spectrum and\nquasiparticles. We provide an overview of physical motivations and based on\nthat we propose a spectral and Hamiltonian-based approach towards these terms.\nBased on that, we formulate definitions and propositions related to these\nconcepts. In the second part we recall the Bogoliubov and\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximations, which in the physics literature are\nused to obtain the quasiparticle picture. We show how these two approaches fit\ninto a universal scheme which allows us to arrive at a quasiparticle picture in\na more general setup.

Our analysis is based on the approach we have\npreviously applied to individual decision makers, which we now generalize to\nthe case of decision makers that are members of a society. The approach employs\nthe mathematical techniques that are common in quantum theory, justifying our\nnaming as Quantum Decision Theory. However, we do not assume that decision\nmakers are quantum objects. The techniques of quantum theory are needed only\nfor defining the prospect probabilities taking into account such hidden\nvariables as behavioral biases and other subconscious feelings. The approach\ndescribes an agent's choice as a probabilistic event occurring with a\nprobability that is the sum of a utility factor and of an attraction factor.\nThe attraction factor embodies subjective and unconscious dimensions in the\nmind of the decision maker. We show that the typical aggregate amplitude of the\nattraction factor is $1/4$, and it can be either positive or negative depending\non the relative attraction of the competing choices. The most efficient way of\nvarying the decision makers choice is realized by influencing the attraction\nfactor. This can be done in two ways. One method is to arrange in a special\nmanner the payoff weights, which induces the required changes of the values of\nattraction factors. We show that a slight variation of the payoff weights can\ninvert the sign of the attraction factors and reverse the decision preferences,\neven when the prospect utilities remain unchanged. The second method of\ninfluencing the decision makers choice is by providing information to decision\nmakers. The methods of influencing decision making are illustrated by several\nexperiments, whose outcomes are compared quantitatively with the predictions of\nour approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 08:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-03"}

The orbit of a\nplanet around a binary stellar system poses several dynamic constraints. The\neffects that radiation from the host stars may have on the planet atmospheres\nmust be considered. Because of the configuration of a close binary system,\nthese stars have a high rotation rate, which causes a permanent state of high\nstellar activity and copious XUV radiation. The accumulated effects are\nstronger than for exoplanets around single stars, and cause a faster\nevaporation of their atmospheres. We evaluate the effects that stellar\nradiation has on the evaporation of exoplanets around binary systems and on the\nsurvival of these planets. We considered the XUV spectral range to account for\nthe photons that are easily absorbed by a planet atmosphere that is mainly\ncomposed of hydrogen. A more complex atmospheric composition is expected to\nabsorb this radiation more efficiently. We used direct X-ray observations to\nevaluate the energy in the X-rays range and coronal models to calculate the\n(nondetectable) EUV part of the spectrum. The simulations show that exoplanets\nin a close orbit will suffer strong photoevaporation that may cause a total\nloss of atmosphere in a short time. A binary system of two solar-like stars\nwill be highly efficient in evaporating the atmosphere of the planet. These\nsystems will be difficult to find, even if they are dynamically stable. Still,\nplanets may orbit around binary systems of low mass stars for wider orbits.\nCurrently known circumbinary planets are not substantially affected by thermal\nphotoevaporation processes, unless Kepler-47 b has an inflated atmosphere. The\ndistribution of the orbital periods of circumbinary planets is shifted to much\nlonger periods than the average of Kepler planets, which supports a scenario of\nstrong photoevaporation in close-in circumbinary planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 09:24:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-15"}

It turns out that all ingredients entering the\ncomponent action can be obtained almost algorithmically by using the nonlinear\nrealizations approach. Within this approach, properly adapted to the\nconstruction of on-shell component actions, we pay much attention to broken\nsupersymmetry. Doing so, we were able to write the action in terms of purely\ngeometric objects (vielbeins and covariant derivatives of the physical bosonic\ncomponents), covariant with respect to broken supersymmetry. It turns out that\nall terms of the higher orders in the fermions, are hidden inside these\ncovariant derivatives and vielbeins. Moreover, the main part of the component\naction just mimics its bosonic cousin in which the ordinary space-time\nderivatives and the bosonic world volume are replaced by their covariant\nsupersymmetric analogs. The Wess-Zumino term in the action, which does not\nexist in the bosonic case, can be also easily constructed in terms of reduced\nCartan forms.

The galaxy was observed in imaging mode with an angular\nresolution of 0.24 arcsec (54 pc) in the Si-2 filter (8.7 micron). The image\nreveals a series of star-forming knots within the central ~400 pc, after\nsubtracting the dominant active galactic nucleus (AGN) component. We also\nsubtracted this AGN unresolved component from the 8-13 micron spectra of the\nknots and the nucleus, and measured equivalent widths (EWs) of the 11.3 micron\nPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) feature which are typical of pure\nstarburst galaxies. This EW is larger in the nucleus than in the knots,\nconfirming that, at least in the case of Mrk 1066, the AGN dilutes, rather than\ndestroys, the molecules responsible for the 11.3 micron PAH emission. By\ncomparing the nuclear GTC/CC spectrum with the Spitzer/IRS spectrum of the\ngalaxy, we find that the AGN component that dominates the continuum emission at\nwavelengths below 15 micron on scales of ~60 pc (90-100%) decreases to 35-50%\nwhen the emission of the central ~830 pc is considered.

It is still challenging due to the common presence\nof outlier channels and the large solution space. To address the above two\nissues, we propose a novel model by emphasizing both robust representation and\nlearning-based sparsity. Specifically, we apply the $\\ell_{2,1}$-norm to\nmeasure the representation error, preventing outlier channels from dominating\nour objective. In this way, the side effects of outlier channels are greatly\nrelieved. Besides, we observe that the mixed level of each pixel varies over\nimage grids. Based on this observation, we exploit a learning-based sparsity\nmethod to simultaneously learn the HU results and a sparse guidance map. Via\nthis guidance map, the sparsity constraint in the $\\ell_{p}\\!\\left(\\!0\\!<\\!\np\\!\\leq\\!1\\right)$-norm is adaptively imposed according to the learnt mixed\nlevel of each pixel. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model is\nbetter suited to the real situation, thus expected to achieve better HU\nresults. The resulted objective is highly non-convex and non-smooth, and so it\nis hard to optimize. As a profound theoretical contribution, we propose an\nefficient algorithm to solve it. Meanwhile, the convergence proof and the\ncomputational complexity analysis are systematically provided. Extensive\nevaluations verify that our method is highly promising for the HU task---it\nachieves very accurate guidance maps and much better HU results compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 12:36:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 04:13:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 08:10:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 26 Aug 2017 17:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

AW UMa appears to be a very tight,\nsemi-detached binary; the mass transfer takes place from the more massive to\nthe less massive component. The primary, a fast-rotating star with V sin i =\n181.4+\\-2.5 km s^-1, is covered by inhomogeneities: very slowly drifting spots\nand a dense network of ripples more closely participating in its rotation. The\nspectral lines of the primary show an additional broadening component (called\nthe \"pedestal\") which originates either in the equatorial regions which rotate\nfaster than the rest of the star by about 50 km s^-1 or in an external\ndisk-like structure. The secondary component appears to be smaller than\npredicted by the contact model. The radial velocity field around the secondary\nis dominated by accretion of matter transferred from (and possibly partly\nreturned to) the primary component. The parameters of the binary are: A sin i =\n2.73 +/- 0.11 R_odot and M_1 sin^3 i = 1.29 +/- 0.15 M_odot, M_2 sin^3 i =\n0.128 +/- 0.016 M_odot.

The purpose of this paper is to revisit the morphology of the almost\nedge-on debris disk around HD 15115.\n  Methods. We analyzed data from the Gemini science archive obtained in 2009\nand 2011 with the Near-Infrared Coronagraphic Imager instrument in the H and Ks\nbands using coronagraphy and angular differential imaging tech- niques.\n  Results. We resolved the disk in both the H and Ks bands.

The inner part is likely depleted of\ndust. The fainter side of the disk is suspected but not firmly detected, which\nalso indicates a large anisotropic scattering factor.\n  Conclusions. The morphological symmetry of the disk contrasts with the\nobvious brightness asymmetry. This asymmetry may be explained by the\ncoexistence of several types of grains in this disk and/or variable dust\ndensity.

It shows the primary and secondary eclipses of a close binary of 0.258d\nas well as complex dipping events that last for about 1.5d at a time and recur\non a 204d period. The dips are thought to result when the close binary passes\nacross the face of a third star. In this paper we present an attempt to model\nthe dips. Despite the apparent simplicity of the system and strenuous efforts\nto find a solution, we find that we cannot match the dips with a triple star\nwhile satisfying Kepler's laws. The problem is that to match the dips the\nseparation of the close binary has to be larger than possible relative to the\nouter orbit given the orbital periods. Quadruple star models can get round this\nproblem but require the addition of a so-far undetected intermediate period of\norder 5 -- 20d that has be a near-perfect integer divisor of the outer 204d\nperiod. Although we have no good explanation for KIC 2856960, using the full\nset of Kepler data we are able to update several of its parameters.

This allows the\nejected gas to reach larger radii in higher-mass clusters than would be\npossible had a fixed heating temperature been used. Such a model also\nsuccessfully reduces the star formation rate in brightest cluster galaxies and\nbroadly reproduces a number of other observational properties at low redshift,\nincluding baryon, gas and star fractions; entropy profiles outside the core;\nand the X-ray luminosity-mass relation.

Our results show that it is possible to obtain\nequivalent models that implement the same mechanisms; however, the incapacity\nof the Gillespie algorithm to retain individual memory of past events affects\nthe similarity of some results.

Consensus trees often provide\nlimited information about a sample, and so methods such as consensus networks,\nclustering and multidimensional scaling have been developed and applied to tree\nsamples. This paper describes a stochastic algorithm for constructing a\nprincipal geodesic or line through treespace which is analogous to the first\nprincipal component in standard Principal Components Analysis. A principal\ngeodesic summarizes the most variable features of a sample of trees, in terms\nof both tree topology and branch lengths, and it can be visualized as an\nanimation of smoothly changing trees. The algorithm performs a stochastic\nsearch through parameter space for a geodesic which minimises the sum of\nsquared projected distances of the data points. This procedure aims to identify\nthe globally optimal principal geodesic, though convergence to locally optimal\ngeodesics is possible. The methodology is illustrated by constructing principal\ngeodesics for experimental and simulated data sets, demonstrating the insight\ninto samples of trees that can be gained and how the method improves on a\npreviously published approach.

In each case, a subset of the available data is used for training\nto establish thresholds, limits or likelihoods of class membership for each\nattribute, and hence create mass functions that establish probability of class\nmembership for each attribute of the test data. Classification of each data\nitem is achieved by combination of these probabilities via Dempster's Rule of\nCombination. Results for the first two datasets show extremely high\nclassification accuracy that is competitive with other popular methods.

In\naddition, there is significant evidence for a strong self-interaction of dark\nmatter. QUD is a unique massless SU(5) field theory with an anomaly-generated\nbound-state S-Matrix that could be an unconventional origin for the Standard\nModel. The electroweak scale color sextet quark enhanced QCD interaction is the\nonly new physics. Production of multiple vector bosons, that acquire masses via\nsextet quark pions, will give the AMS positron and electron cross-sections -\nrelated vector boson pair production having been seen at the LHC. Stable sextet\nquark neutrons (neusons) provide a novel form of very strongly interacting dark\nmatter that has the desired experimental properties. Large rapidity hadronic\nproduction of neusons will produce the knee.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 01:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-23"}

From\nthe modulated stream, the two channels can be recovered with minimal processing\nand no cross-talk. Notably, demultiplexing does not affect the sample-depth so\nthat, after it, one still has a data stream suitable for directly driving a\npower bridge and convertible into analog by mere low-pass filtering.\nFurthermore, the approach is very flexible and if one channel is unused, it\nlets the other get improved dynamic range and SNR. The approach can take\nadvantage of recent techniques for the design of {\\Delta}{\\Sigma} modulators,\nincluding methods for psychoacoustically optimal distribution of quantization\nnoise.

If ${{R_{il}}=0}$ (the space empty with\nmatter, but it can be occupied by gravitational waves) then\n${{R_{iklm}}={C_{iklm}}} $ . The tensor ${C_{iklm}}$ is the Weyl tensor, which\ndisappears by conversion:${{R_{il}}={g^{km}}{R_{iklm}}}$ and we lose all\ninformation about the space structure, which is described by ${C_{iklm}}$ .The\nsymmetry of ${R_{il}}$ provides the existents of gravitational waves with the\nspin s=2. We show that ${C_{iklm}}$ describes gravitational waves with s=1.\nSuch gravitational waves can be created in inhomogeneous media, where the\nselected directions are determined by derivates of the energy-momentum tensor\n${T^m}_{i,k}$ of matter. It is taken into account that gravitation is described\nnot only by the metric tensor $g^{ik} = (1/2)(\\gamma^i \\gamma^k + \\gamma^k\n\\gamma^i)$, but also by the anti-symmetric tensor $\\sigma^{ik} =\n(i/2)({\\gamma^i}{\\gamma^k} - {\\gamma^k}{\\gamma^i})$, where ${\\gamma^k}(x)$ are\nClifford matrices. We show that the tensor ${K_{ik}} = (1/4){\\sigma^{lm}}\n{R_{iklm}}$, is the anty-simmetric analog to the Ricci tensor. The ${K_{lm}}$\ndescribes various kinds of space metrics, not described by the Ricci tensor.
