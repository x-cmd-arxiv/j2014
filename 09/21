The spectral feature may originate from the pulsar wind\nnebula and may be partly caused by the reprocessed X-ray radiation by the\nfallback disk.

In order to\ncharacterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physical\nconditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of the\nentire sample of 61 galaxies from Key Insights into Nearby Galaxies:\nFar-Infrared Survey with Herschel (KINGFISH). The main goal of our work is the\ncharacterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellar\nradiation fields responsible for heating the dust. After fitting the dust and\nstellar radial profiles with exponential functions, we fit the far-infrared\nspectral energy distribution (SED) in each annular region with\nsingle-temperature modified black bodies using both variable (MBBV) and fixed\n(MBBF) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dust\nmodels. Results show that while most SED parameters decrease with radius, the\nemissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but in\nothers is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outer\nones. Despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of the\nphysically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectral\nslopes with beta<= 1. We find that flatter slopes (beta<= 1.5) are associated\nwith cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usual\nTdust-beta degeneracy. This trend is related to variations in Umin since beta\nand Umin are very closely linked over the entire range in Umin sampled by the\nKINGFISH galaxies: low Umin is associated with flat beta<=1. Both these results\nstrongly suggest that the low apparent \\beta values (flat slopes) in MBBV fits\nare caused by temperature mixing along the line-of-sight, rather than by\nintrinsic variations in grain properties.

When\nthe portfolio is built using noisy data, the expected value of the signal-noise\nratio is bounded from above via a Cramer-Rao bound, for the case of Gaussian\nreturns. The bound holds for `biased' estimators, thus there appears to be no\nbias-variance tradeoff for the problem of maximizing the signal-noise ratio. An\napproximate distribution of the signal-noise ratio for the Markowitz portfolio\nis given, and shown to be fairly accurate via Monte Carlo simulations, for\nGaussian returns as well as more exotic returns distributions.

More precisely, even in presence of the most adversarial\noutlier distribution over computing nodes, DRL still achieves a breakdown point\nof at least $ \\lambda^*/2 $, where $ \\lambda^* $ is the break down point of\ncorresponding centralized algorithm. This is in stark contrast with naive\ndivision-and-averaging implementation, which may reduce the breakdown point by\na factor of $ k $ when $ k $ computing nodes are used. We then specialize the\nDRL framework for two concrete cases: distributed robust principal component\nanalysis and distributed robust regression.

This\ncharacteristic is no less relevant when attempting to simulate such phenomena,\ngiven that the outcome is not always a foregone conclusion. The present survey\nfocuses on several simple model systems that exhibit surprisingly rich emergent\nbehavior, all studied by MD simulation. The examples are taken from the\ndisparate fields of fluid dynamics, granular matter and supramolecular\nself-assembly. In studies of fluids modeled at the detailed microscopic level\nusing discrete particles, the simulations demonstrate that complex hydrodynamic\nphenomena in rotating and convecting fluids, the Taylor-Couette and\nRayleigh-B\\'enard instabilities, can not only be observed within the limited\nlength and time scales accessible to MD, but even quantitative agreement can be\nachieved. Simulation of highly counterintuitive segregation phenomena in\ngranular mixtures, again using MD methods, but now augmented by forces\nproducing damping and friction, leads to results that resemble experimentally\nobserved axial and radial segregation in the case of a rotating cylinder, and\nto a novel form of horizontal segregation in a vertically vibrated layer.\nFinally, when modeling self-assembly processes analogous to the formation of\nthe polyhedral shells that package spherical viruses, simulation of suitably\nshaped particles reveals the ability to produce complete, error-free assembly,\nand leads to the important general observation that reversible growth steps\ncontribute to the high yield. While there are limitations to the MD approach,\nboth computational and conceptual, the results offer a tantalizing hint of the\nkinds of phenomena that can be explored, and what might be discovered when\nsufficient resources are brought to bear on a problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Sep 2014 09:44:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 16:42:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

An extremal h-basis A_k is one for which n is as large as\npossible, and then we write n = n_h(k).\n  The \"local\" Postage Stamp Problem is concerned with properties of particular\nsets A_k, and it is clear that sets where n_h(A_k) does not exceed a_k are of\nlittle interest. We define h_0(k) to be the smallest value of h for which\nn_h(A_k) exceeds a_k; such sets are called \"admissible\".\n  We say that a value n can be \"generated\" by A_k if it can be expressed as the\nsum of no more than h values a_i, or - equivalently - if it can be expressed as\nthe sum of exactly h values a_i from the set A'_k = {0, a_1, a_2, ... a_k}.

Here we are\ninterested in the pattern of missing values for values that lie between h_0 and\nh_2.\n  On page 7.8 of Selmer [5] he conjectures that the sequence of differences\nm_h(A_k) - m_(h+1)(A_k) is non-increasing as h runs from h_0 to h_2. When I\ncame across this conjecture I could not convince myself that it was likely to\nbe true, having found a possible error in Selmer's justification.

For general systems the average phase-space volume ratio\nexpanded to second order delivers a q parameter related to the heat capacity\nand to the variance of the temperature. However, q differing from one leads to\nnon-additivity of the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. We demonstrate that a deformed\nentropy, K(S), can be constructed and used for demanding additivity. This\nrequirement leads to a second order differential equation for K(S). Finally,\nthe generalized q-entropy formula contains the Tsallis, Renyi and\nBoltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon expressions as particular cases. For diverging\ntemperature variance we obtain a novel entropy formula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Sep 2014 11:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

Specifically, we establish sharp\nasymptotic zero-one laws for $k$-connectivity and $k$-robustness, as well as\nthe asymptotically exact probability of $k$-connectivity, for any positive\ninteger $k$. The $k$-connectivity property quantifies how resilient is the\nconnectivity of a graph against node or edge failures. On the other hand,\n$k$-robustness measures the effectiveness of local diffusion strategies (that\ndo not use global graph topology information) in spreading information over the\ngraph in the presence of misbehaving nodes. In addition to presenting the\nresults under the general random intersection graph model, we consider two\nspecial cases of the general model, a binomial random intersection graph and a\nuniform random intersection graph, which both have numerous applications as\nwell. For these two specialized graphs, our results on asymptotically exact\nprobabilities of $k$-connectivity and asymptotic zero-one laws for\n$k$-robustness are also novel in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Sep 2014 15:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Transitions in the other three systems do not show CP violation so\nfar and therefore neither T nor CPT violation.

The user\ndemands are progressively rampant, while application requirements continue to\nexpand in both range and diversity. Future wireless networks, therefore, must\nbe equipped with the ability to handle numerous, albeit challenging\nrequirements. Network reconfiguration, considered as a prominent network\nparadigm, is envisioned to play a key role in leveraging future network\nperformance and considerably advancing current user experiences. This paper\npresents a comprehensive overview of reconfigurable wireless networks and an\nin-depth analysis of reconfiguration at all layers of the protocol stack. Such\nnetworks characteristically possess the ability to reconfigure and adapt their\nhardware and software components and architectures, thus enabling flexible\ndelivery of broad services, as well as sustaining robust operation under highly\ndynamic conditions. The paper offers a unifying framework for research in\nreconfigurable wireless networks. This should provide the reader with a\nholistic view of concepts, methods, and strategies in reconfigurable wireless\nnetworks. Focus is given to reconfigurable systems in relatively new and\nemerging research areas such as cognitive radio networks, cross-layer\nreconfiguration and software-defined networks. In addition, modern networks\nhave to be intelligent and capable of self-organization. Thus, this paper\ndiscusses the concept of network intelligence as a means to enable\nreconfiguration in highly complex and dynamic networks. Finally, the paper is\nsupported with several examples and case studies showing the tremendous impact\nof reconfiguration on wireless networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Sep 2014 15:58:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}
