In order\nto put constraints on formation scenarios we search for signatures in the orbit\ndynamics of the systems. We are specifically interested in the eccentricities\nand inclinations since those parameters might tell us about the dynamic history\nof the systems and where to look for additional low-mass sub-stellar\ncompanions. For this purpose we utilized VLT/NACO to take several well\ncalibrated high resolution images of 6 target systems and analyze them together\nwith available literature data points of those systems as well as Hubble Space\nTelescope archival data. We used a statistical Least-Squares Monte-Carlo\napproach to constrain the orbit elements of all systems that showed significant\ndifferential motion of the primary star and companion. We show for the first\ntime that the GQ Lup system shows significant change in both separation and\nposition angle. Our analysis yields best fitting orbits for this system, which\nare eccentric (e between 0.21 and 0.69), but can not rule out circular orbits\nat high inclinations. Given our astrometry we discuss formation scenarios of\nthe GQ Lup system. In addition, we detected an even fainter new companion\ncandidate to GQ Lup, which is most likely a background object. We also updated\nthe orbit constraints of the PZ Tel system, confirming that the companion is on\na highly eccentric orbit with e > 0.62. Finally we show with a high\nsignificance, that there is no orbital motion observed in the cases of the DH\nTau, HD 203030 and 1RXS J160929.1-210524 systems and give the most precise\nrelative astrometric measurement of the UScoCTIO 108 system to date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 16:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We present high accuracy radiative forcings for CO2, CH4 and 26 other\ngases, performing the radiative transfer calculations at line-by-line\nresolution and using HITRAN 2012 line data for background pressures of 0.5, 1,\nand 2 bar of atmospheric N2. For CO2 to resolve the FYSP alone at 2.8 Gyr BP\n(80% of present solar luminosity), 0.32 bar is needed with 0.5 bar of\natmospheric N2, 0.20 bar with 1 bar of atmospheric N2, or 0.11 bar with 2 bar\nof atmospheric N2. For CH4, we find that near-infrared absorption is much\nstronger than previously thought, arising from updates to the HITRAN database.\nCH4 radiative forcing peaks at 10.3, 9, or 8.3 Wm-2 for background pressures of\n0.5, 1 or 2 bar, likely limiting the utility of CH4 for warming the Archean.\nFor the other 26 HITRAN gases, radiative forcings of up to a few to 10 Wm-2 are\nobtained from concentrations of 0.1-1 ppmv for many gases.

We consider the partonic\nprocesses $gggZZ$ and $gq \\bar{q} ZZ$ in which interference between signal and\nbackground diagrams first occurs. Since interference is primarily an\noff-resonant effect for the Higgs boson, we treat the Z-bosons as on-shell.\nThus our analysis is limited to the region above threshold, where the invariant\nmass of the Z-pair, $m_{ZZ}$, satisfies the condition $m_{ZZ}>2m_Z$. In the\nregion $m_{ZZ} > 300$ GeV we find that the interference in the ZZ + jet channel\nis qualitatively similar to interference in the inclusive ZZ channel.

However technological applications are currently limited by\nthe low mobility of the charge carriers associated with the disorder in these\nmaterials [5-8]. Much effort over the past decades has therefore been focused\non optimizing the organisation of the material or the devices to improve\ncarrier mobility. Here we take a radically different path to solving this\nproblem, namely by injecting carriers into states that are hybridized to the\nvacuum electromagnetic field. These are coherent states that can extend over as\nmany as 10^5 molecules and should thereby favour conductivity in such\nmaterials. To test this idea, organic semiconductors were strongly coupled to\nthe vacuum electromagnetic field on plasmonic structures to form polaritonic\nstates with large Rabi splittings ca. 0.7 eV. Conductivity experiments show\nthat indeed the current does increase by an order of magnitude at resonance in\nthe coupled state, reflecting mostly a change in field-effect mobility as\nrevealed when the structure is gated in a transistor configuration. A\ntheoretical quantum model is presented that confirms the delocalization of the\nwave-functions of the hybridized states and the consequences on the\nconductivity. While this is a proof-of-principle study, in practice\nconductivity mediated by light-matter hybridized states is easy to implement\nand we therefore expect that it will be used to improve organic devices. More\nbroadly our findings illustrate the potential of engineering the vacuum\nelectromagnetic environment to modify and to improve properties of materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 18:51:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2015 10:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-30"}

Our model provides daily maps of\nthe distribution of the photospheric field and the TSI starting from 1878. We\nfirst calculate the magnetic flux on the solar surface emerging in active and\nephemeral regions. The evolution of the magnetic flux in active regions is\ncomputed using a surface flux transport model fed with the observed record of\nsunspot group areas and positions. The magnetic flux in ephemeral regions is\ntreated separately using the concept of overlapping cycles. To model the\nephemeral region cycles, we assume that their length and amplitude are related\nto that of the sunspot cycles. We then use a version of the SATIRE model to\ncompute the TSI. The area coverage and the distribution of different magnetic\nfeatures as a function of time, which are required by SATIRE, are extracted\nfrom the simulated magnetograms and the modelled ephemeral region magnetic\nflux. Previously computed intensity spectra of the various types of magnetic\nfeatures are employed. Our model reproduces the PMOD composite of TSI\nmeasurements starting from 1978 at daily and rotational timescales more\naccurately than the previous version of the SATIRE model computing TSI over\nthis period of time. The simulated magnetograms provide a more realistic\nrepresentation of the evolution of the magnetic field on the photosphere and\nalso allow us to make use of information on the spatial distribution of the\nmagnetic fields before the times when observed magnetograms were available. We\nfind that the secular increase in TSI since 1878 is fairly stable to\nmodifications of the treatment of the ephemeral region magnetic flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 20:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-15"}

At the same time, the Drosophila genome\nevolves under different rates of recombination, which results in partial\ngenetic linkage between alleles at neighboring genomic loci. Here we analyze\nhow linkage correlations affect adaptive evolution. We develop a new inference\nmethod for adaptation that takes into account the effect on an allele at a\nfocal site caused by neighboring deleterious alleles (background selection) and\nby neighboring adaptive substitutions (hitchhiking). Using complete genome\nsequence data and fine-scale recombination maps, we infer a highly\nheterogeneous scenario of adaptation in Drosophila. In high-recombining\nregions, about 50% of all amino acid substitutions are adaptive, together with\nabout 20% of all substitutions in proximal intergenic regions. In\nlow-recombining regions, only a small fraction of the amino acid substitutions\nare adaptive, while hitchhiking accounts for the majority of these changes.\nHitchhiking of deleterious alleles generates a substantial collateral cost of\nadaptation, leading to a fitness decline of about 30/2N per gene and per\nmillion years in the lowest-recombining regions. Our results show how\nrecombination shapes rate and efficacy of the adaptive dynamics in eukaryotic\ngenomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 21:09:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-09"}

Topics discussed\nin Part 1 of this review include computationally quantifying of tumor\nsubpopulations; clone-based network modeling, cancer hallmark-based networks\nand their high-order rewiring principles and the principles of cell survival\nnetworks of fast-growing clones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2014 02:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-09"}

If a principal and an agent enter into such a\ncontract, the principal can optimally manage its performance and risk with a\nguarantee that the agent's risk is less than or equal to a pre-specified level\nand that the agent's expected payoff is greater than or equal to another\npre-specified threshold. We achieve such risk-management capabilities by\nformulating the contract design problem as mean-variance constrained\nrisk-sensitive control. A dynamic programming-based method is developed to\nsolve the problem. The key idea of our proposed solution method is to\nreformulate the inequality constraints on the mean and the variance of the\nagent's payoff as dynamical system constraints by introducing new state and\ncontrol variables. The reformulations use the martingale representation\ntheorem. The proposed contract method enables us to develop a new direct load\ncontrol method that provides the load-serving entity with financial risk\nmanagement solutions in real-time electricity markets. We also propose an\napproximate decomposition of the optimal contract design problem for multiple\ncustomers into multiple low-dimensional contract problems for one customer.\nThis allows the direct load control program to work with a large number of\ncustomers without any scalability issues. Furthermore, the contract design\nprocedure can be completely parallelized. The performance and usefulness of the\nproposed contract method and its application to direct load control are\ndemonstrated using data on the electric energy consumption of customers in\nAustin, Texas as well as the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas'\nlocational marginal price data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2014 07:55:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Sep 2014 01:32:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Oct 2014 01:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-10"}

While many previous studies investigate their rheological\nproperties in laminar flows, little is known on the behaviour of these\nsuspensions in the turbulent/inertial regime. The present study aims to fill\nthis gap by investigating the turbulent flow of a Newtonian fluid laden with\nsolid neutrally-buoyant spheres at relatively high volume fractions in a plane\nchannel. Direct Numerical Simulation are performed in the range of volume\nfractions Phi=0-0.2 with an Immersed Boundary Method used to account for the\ndispersed phase. The results show that the mean velocity profiles are\nsignificantly altered by the presence of a solid phase with a decrease of the\nvon Karman constant in the log-law. The overall drag is found to increase with\nthe volume fraction, more than one would expect just considering the increase\nof the system viscosity due to the presence of the particles. At the highest\nvolume fraction here investigated, Phi=0.2, the velocity fluctuation\nintensities and the Reynolds shear stress are found to decrease. The analysis\nof the mean momentum balance shows that the particle-induced stresses govern\nthe dynamics at high Phi and are the main responsible of the overall drag\nincrease. In the dense limit, we therefore find a decrease of the turbulence\nactivity and a growth of the particle induced stress, where the latter\ndominates for the Reynolds numbers considered here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2014 08:10:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 11:49:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2015 09:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-15"}

However, it does not include the effects of surface\nstress, which has recently been shown to control many processes in soft\nmaterials such as gels, elastomers and biological tissue. To extend Eshelby's\ntheory of inclusions to soft materials, we consider liquid inclusions within an\nisotropic, compressible, linear-elastic solid. We solve for the displacement\nand stress fields around individual stretched inclusions, accounting for the\nbulk elasticity of the solid and the surface tension (\\textit{i.e.} isotropic\nstrain-independent surface stress) of the solid-liquid interface. Surface\ntension significantly alters the inclusion's shape and stiffness as well as its\nnear- and far-field stress fields. These phenomenon depend strongly on the\nratio of inclusion radius, $R$, to an elastocapillary length, $L$. Surface\ntension is significant whenever inclusions are smaller than $100L$. While\nEshelby theory predicts that liquid inclusions generically reduce the stiffness\nof an elastic solid, our results show that liquid inclusions can actually\nstiffen a solid when $R<3L/2$. Intriguingly, surface tension cloaks the\nfar-field signature of liquid inclusions when $R=3L/2$. These results are have\nfar-reaching applications from measuring local stresses in biological tissue,\nto determining the failure strength of soft composites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2014 09:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-09"}

These techniques are (a) from defining a local set of\nEulerian coordinates embedded into the Lagrangian frame; (b) from performing a\nspecific gauge transformation; and (c) from a fully non-perturbative approach\nbased on the ADM split. The latter approach shows that this decomposition is\nnot tied to a specific perturbative formulation for the solution of the\nEinstein equations. Rather, it can be defined at the level of the\nnon-perturbative coordinate change from the Lagrangian to the Eulerian\ndescription. Studying such different techniques is useful because it allows us\nto compare and develop further the various approximation techniques available\nin the Lagrangian formulation.

Then the pathway idea is described where\none can switch to different functional forms of the probability density\nfunction) through a parameter called the pathway parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2014 06:12:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-10"}

The 2D model of the substructure is a rigid central mass\nsupported by $J$ axisymmetrically placed linear springs. The response of the\nshell-spring-mass system is quite different from a fluid filled shell or that\nof a solid cylinder due to the discrete number of contact points which couple\nthe displacement of the shell at different locations. Exterior acoustic\nscattering due to normal plane wave incidence is solved in closed form for\narbitrary $J$. The scattering matrix associated with the normal mode solution\ndisplays a simple structure, composed of distinct sub-matrices which decouple\nthe incident and scattered fields into $J$ families. The presence of a\nsprings-mass substructure causes resonances which are shown to be related to\nthe subsonic shell flexural waves, and an approximate analytic expression is\nderived for the quasi-flexural resonance frequencies. Numerical simulations\nindicate that the new solution for $J\\ge 3$ springs results in a complicated\nscattering response for plane wave incidence. As the number of springs becomes\nlarge enough, the total scattering cross-section is asymptotically zero at low\nfrequencies and slightly increased compared to the empty shell at moderate\nfrequencies due to the added stiffness and mass. It is also observed that the\nsensitivity to the angle of incidence diminishes as the number of springs is\nincreased. This system can be tuned by selecting the shell thickness, spring\nstiffness and added mass to yield desired quasi-static effective properties\nmaking it a candidate element for graded index sonic crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 16:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}
