Side effects that occur in\nmore than one in a thousand patients are likely to be signalled efficiently by\ncurrent drug surveillance methods, however, these same methods may take decades\nbefore generating signals for rarer side effects, risking medical morbidity or\nmortality in patients prescribed the drug while the rare side effect is\nundiscovered. In this paper we propose a novel computational meta-analysis\nframework for signalling rare side effects that integrates existing methods,\nknowledge from the web, metric learning and semi-supervised clustering. The\nnovel framework was able to signal many known rare and serious side effects for\nthe selection of drugs investigated, such as tendon rupture when prescribed\nCiprofloxacin or Levofloxacin, renal failure with Naproxen and depression\nassociated with Rimonabant. Furthermore, for the majority of the drug\ninvestigated it generated signals for rare side effects at a more stringent\nsignalling threshold than existing methods and shows the potential to become a\nfundamental part of post marketing surveillance to detect rare side effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 16:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

The main reason this safety knowledge is lacking is due to\nethical restrictions that prevent children from being included in the majority\nof clinical trials. Objective: The objective of this paper is to investigate\nwhether an ensemble of simple study designs can be implemented to signal\nacutely occurring side effects effectively within the paediatric population by\nusing historical longitudinal data. The majority of pharmacovigilance\ntechniques are unsupervised, but this research presents a supervised framework.\nMethods: Multiple measures of association are calculated for each drug and\nmedical event pair and these are used as features that are fed into a\nclassiffier to determine the likelihood of the drug and medical event pair\ncorresponding to an adverse drug reaction. The classiffier is trained using\nknown adverse drug reactions or known non-adverse drug reaction relationships.\nResults: The novel ensemble framework obtained a false positive rate of 0:149,\na sensitivity of 0:547 and a specificity of 0:851 when implemented on a\nreference set of drug and medical event pairs.

We make the simplest\nassumption that the probability for explosion is constant in time for up to\nabout 10^5 yrs after the merger of the core with the white dwarf (WD) in the\nframe of the core-degenerate scenario.

In this study we make use of a novel approach to find a best fit\nmodel that follows the published orbit. Instead of using trial and error, we\nuse a systematic approach in order to find a model that fits multiple\nobservables simultaneously. As such, we investigate a much wider parameter\nrange of initial conditions and ensure we have found the best match possible.\nUsing a dark matter free progenitor that undergoes tidal disruption, our\nbest-fit model can simultaneously match the observed luminosity, central\nsurface brightness, effective radius, velocity dispersion, and velocity\ngradient of Hercules. However, we find it is impossible to reproduce the\nobserved elongation and the position angle of Hercules at the same time in our\nmodels. This failure persists even when we vary the duration of the simulation\nsignificantly, and consider a more cuspy density distribution for the\nprogenitor.

The most interesting among them both in terms\nof elegance of the setup and of the richness of the emerging phenomenology is\nthe Randall-Sundrum II model where one infinite extra spacelike dimension is\nconsidered with an AdS topology, characterized by the warping effect caused by\nthe presence of a negative cosmological constant in the bulk.

Using these axioms, we extend the nonabelian\nPoincar\\'e duality of Salvatore and Lurie to the setting of stratified spaces\n-- this is a nonabelian version of the Poincar\\'e duality given by intersection\nhomology. We pay special attention to the simple case of singular manifolds\nwhose singularity datum is a properly embedded submanifold and give a further\nsimplified algebraic characterization of these homology theories. In the case\nof 3-manifolds with 1-dimensional submanifolds, these structure gives rise to\nknot and link homology theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 19:57:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 03:49:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2016 21:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-10"}

Here, we propose a Bayesian model averaging method to properly\nquantify the relationship between radiation dose and disease outcomes by\naccounting for shared and unshared uncertainty in estimated dose. Our Bayesian\nrisk analysis method utilizes multiple realizations of sets (vectors) of doses\ngenerated by a two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation method that properly\nseparates shared and unshared errors in dose estimation. The exposure model\nused in this work is taken from a study of the risk of thyroid nodules among a\ncohort of 2,376 subjects following exposure to fallout resulting from nuclear\ntesting in Kazakhstan. We assessed the performance of our method through an\nextensive series of simulation tests and comparisons against conventional\nregression risk analysis methods. We conclude that when estimated doses contain\nrelatively small amounts of uncertainty, the Bayesian method using multiple\nrealizations of possibly true dose vectors gave similar results to the\nconventional regression-based methods of dose-response analysis. However, when\nlarge and complex mixtures of shared and unshared uncertainties are present,\nthe Bayesian method using multiple dose vectors had significantly lower\nrelative bias than conventional regression-based risk analysis methods as well\nas a markedly increased capability to include the pre-established 'true' risk\ncoefficient within the credible interval of the Bayesian-based risk estimate.\nAn evaluation of the dose-response using our method is presented for an\nepidemiological study of thyroid disease following radiation exposure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 19:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

This cannot be explained by\nusing general relativity without dark matter. So far, dark matter particles\nhave not been detected in laboratory measurements or at the LHC. We demonstrate\nthat enhanced structure growth can happen in a modified gravity theory (MOG).\nThe vector field and particle introduced in the theory to explain galaxy and\ncluster dynamics plays an important role in generating the required structure\ngrowth. The particle called the phion (a light hidden photon) is neutral and is\na dominant, pressureless component in the MOG Friedmann equations, before the\ntime of decoupling. The dominant energy density of the phion particle in the\nearly universe, generates an explanation for the growth of density\nperturbations. The angular acoustical power spectrum due to baryon-photon\npressure waves is in agreement with the Planck 2013 data.

Some ingredients reflecting this viewpoint are (1) the use of\n(discrete) differential forms of various degrees to represent fields, currents,\nand charged particles and provide localization rules for the degrees of freedom\nthereof on the various grid elements (nodes, edges, facets), (2) use of Whitney\nforms as basic interpolants from discrete differential forms to continuum\nspace, and (3) use of a Galerkin formula for the discrete Hodge star operators\n(i.e., \"mass matrices\" incorporating the metric datum of the grid) applicable\nto generally irregular, unstructured grids. The expressions obtained for the\nscatter charges and scatter currents are very concise and do not involve\nnumerical quadrature rules. Appropriate fractional areas within each grid\nelement are identified that represent scatter charges and scatter currents\nwithin the element, and a simple geometric representation for the (exact)\ncharge conservation mechanism is obtained by such identification. The field\nupdate is based on the coupled first-order Maxwell's curl equations to avoid\nspurious modes with secular growth (otherwise present in formulations that\ndiscretize the second-order wave equation).

Observations\nof this emission, which could subtend >10 arcmin$^2$ on the sky, would\ndefinitively demonstrate the presence of a neutral intergalactic medium at the\nobserved epoch, placing valuable constraints on the progress of reionization.\nWe find that the expected Lyman-alpha surface brightness is significantly\nweaker than previously determined and may be impossible to observe with current\nand near-future instruments.

The high densities of these winds means that their\nembedded shocks quickly cool by local radiative emission, while cooling by\nexpansion should be negligible. Ignoring for simplicity any non-radiative\nmixing or conductive cooling, the method presented here exploits the idea that\nthe cooling post-shock plasma systematically passes through the temperature\ncharacteristic of distinct emission lines in the X-ray spectrum. In this way,\nthe observed flux distribution among these X-ray lines can be used to construct\nthe cumulative probability distribution of shock strengths that a typical wind\nparcel encounters as it advects through the wind.

Calculating accurate covariances\nis extremely challenging with increasing number of statistics used. Here we\nintroduce a formalism for achieving efficient data compression, based on a\nlocal expansion of statistical measures around a fiducial cosmological model.\nWe specifically apply and test this approach for the case of cosmic shear\nstatistics. We demonstrate the performance of our approach, using a Fisher\nanalysis on cosmic shear tomography described in terms of E-/B-mode separating\nstatistics (COSEBIs). We show that our data compression is highly effective in\nextracting essentially the full cosmological information from a strongly\nreduced number of observables. Specifically, the number of statistics needed\ndecreases by at least one order of magnitude relative to the COSEBIs, which\nalready compress the data substantially compared to the shear two-point\ncorrelation functions. The efficiency appears to be affected only slightly if a\nhighly inaccurate covariance is used for defining the compressed statistics,\nshowing the robustness of the method. We conclude that an efficient data\ncompression is achievable and that the number of compressed statistics depends\non the number of model parameters.\n  In addition, we study how well band powers can be obtained from measuring\nshear correlation functions over a finite interval of separations. We show the\nstrong limitations on the possibility to construct top-hat filters in Fourier\nspace, for which the real-space analog has a finite support, yielding strong\nbounds on the accuracy of band power estimates.

In almost all models\nwe find that significant numbers of black holes (up to $\\sim10^3$) are retained\nall the way to the present. This is in contrast to previous theoretical\nexpectations that most black holes should be ejected dynamically within a few\nGyr. The main reason for this difference is that core collapse driven by black\nholes (through the Spitzer \"mass segregation instability\") is easily reverted\nthrough three-body processes, and involves only a small number of the most\nmassive black holes, while lower-mass black holes remain well-mixed with\nordinary stars far from the central cusp. Thus the rapid segregation of stellar\nblack holes does not lead to a long-term physical separation of most black\nholes into a dynamically decoupled inner core, as often assumed previously.\nCombined with the recent detections of several black hole X-ray binary\ncandidates in Galactic globular clusters, our results suggest that stellar\nblack holes could still be present in large numbers in many globular clusters\ntoday, and that they may play a significant role in shaping the long-term\ndynamical evolution and the present-day dynamical structure of many clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 20:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 21:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

At small\ngalactocentric distances Rgc, a non-zero inclination results in increased mass\nloss rates. Tidal heating and disk shocking, the latter sometimes consisting of\ntwo shocking events as the cluster moves towards and away from the disk, help\nremove stars from the cluster. Clusters with inclined orbits at large Rgc have\ndecreased mass loss rates than the non-inclined case, since the strength the\ndisk potential decreases with Rgc. Clusters with inclined and eccentric orbits\nexperience increased tidal heating due to a constantly changing potential,\nweaker disk shocks since passages occur at higher Rgc, and an additional tidal\nshock at perigalacticon. The effects of orbital inclination decrease with\norbital eccentricity, as a highly eccentric cluster spends the majority of its\nlifetime at a large Rgc. The limiting radii of clusters with inclined orbits\nare best represented by the rt of the cluster when at its maximum height above\nthe disk, where the cluster spends the majority of its lifetime and the rate of\nchange in rt is a minimum. Conversely, the effective radius is independent of\ninclination in all cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 20:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

These structures are seen in maps derived\nfrom spectroscopic surveys that reveal networks of structure that are\ninterconnected with no clear boundaries. Extended regions with a high\nconcentration of galaxies are called 'superclusters', although this term is not\nprecise. There is, however, another way to analyse the structure. If the\ndistance to each galaxy from Earth is directly measured, then the peculiar\nvelocity can be derived from the subtraction of the mean cosmic expansion, the\nproduct of distance times the Hubble constant, from observed velocity. The\npeculiar velocity is the line-of-sight departure from the cosmic expansion and\narises from gravitational perturbations; a map of peculiar velocities can be\ntranslated into a map of the distribution of matter. Here we report a map of\nstructure made using a catalogue of peculiar velocities. We find locations\nwhere peculiar velocity flows diverge, as water does at watershed divides, and\nwe trace the surface of divergent points that surrounds us. Within the volume\nenclosed by this surface, the motions of galaxies are inward after removal of\nthe mean cosmic expansion and long range flows. We define a supercluster to be\nthe volume within such a surface, and so we are defining the extent of our home\nsupercluster, which we call Laniakea.

Each controller is\naffiliated with one station. Each station has an infinite size buffer.\nExogenous customer arrivals at each station occur with rate $\\lambda$. Service\ntimes at each station have rate $\\mu$. At any time, a controller can route one\nof the customers waiting in its own station to the other station. Each\ncontroller knows perfectly the queue length in its own station and observes the\nexogenous arrivals to its own station as well as the arrivals of customers sent\nfrom the other station. At the beginning, each controller has a probability\nmass function (PMF) on the number of customers in the other station. These PMFs\nare common knowledge between the two controllers. At each time a holding cost\nis incurred at each station due to the customers waiting at that station. The\nobjective is to determine routing policies for the two controllers that\nminimize either the total expected holding cost over a finite horizon or the\naverage cost per unit time over an infinite horizon. In this problem there is\nimplicit communication between the two controllers; whenever a controller\ndecides to send or not to send a customer from its own station to the other\nstation it communicates information about its queue length to the other\nstation. This implicit communication through control actions is referred to as\nsignaling in decentralized control. Signaling results in complex communication\nand decision problems. In spite of the complexity of signaling involved, it is\nshown that an optimal signaling strategy is described by a threshold policy\nwhich depends on the common information between the two controllers; this\nthreshold policy is explicitly determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 20:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-04"}

We study the impact of the presence of planets on the lithium abundance\nof host stars and evaluate the previous claim that planet hosts exhibit lithium\ndepletion when compared to their non-host counterparts.\n  Methods. Using previously published lithium abundances, we remove the\nconfounding effect of the different fundamental stellar parameters by applying\na multivariable regression on our dataset. In doing so, we explicitly make an\nassumption made implicitly by different authors: that lithium abundance depends\nlinearly on fundamental stellar parameters. Using a moderator variable to\ndistinguish stars with planets from those without, we evaluate the existence of\nan offset in lithium abundances between the two groups. We perform this\nanalysis first for stars that present a clear lithium detection exclusively and\ninclude in a second analysis upper lithium measurements.\n  Results. Our analysis shows that under the above-mentioned assumption of\nlinearity, a statistically significant negative offset in lithium abundance\nbetween planet hosts and non-hosts is recovered. We concluded that an inflation\non the lithium uncertainty estimations by a factor of larger than 5 is required\nto render the measured offset compatible with zero at less than 3-4 {\\sigma}\nand make it non-significant. We demonstrated that the offset as delivered by\nour method depends on the different nature of the stars in the two samples. We\ndid so by showing that the offset is reduced down to zero if the planet-host\nstars are replaced by comparison stars. Moreover, the measured depletion is\nstill significant when one imposes different constraints on the dataset, such\nas a limit in planetary mass or constrain the host temperature to around solar\nvalue. We conclude then that planet-host stars exhibit enhanced lithium\ndepletion when compared with non-host stars.

Inference of phylogeny from these data demands that we adequately\nmodel the underlying process heterogeneity; failure to do so can lead to biased\nestimates of phylogeny and other parameters. Traditionally, process\nheterogeneity has been accommodated by first assigning sites to data subsets\nbased on relevant prior information (reflecting codon positions in\nprotein-coding DNA, stem and loop regions of ribosomal DNA, etc.), and then\nestimating the phylogeny and other model parameters under the resulting mixed\nmodel. Here, we consider an alternative approach for accommodating process\nheterogeneity that is similar in spirit to this conventional mixed-model\napproach. However, rather than treating the partitioning scheme as a fixed\nassumption of the analysis, we treat the process partition as a random variable\nusing a Dirichlet process prior model, where the phylogeny is estimated by\nintegrating over all possible process partitions for the specified data\nsubsets.

To\ndeal with outliers, robust variants of SVM have been proposed, such as the\nrobust outlier detection algorithm and an SVM with a bounded loss called the\nramp loss. In this paper, we propose a robust variant of SVM and investigate\nits robustness in terms of the breakdown point.

While the log-normal shape and dispersion of its column density PDF is\nstrikingly similar to those of solar neighbourhood clouds, there is one\nimportant quantitative difference: its mean column density is 1--2 orders of\nmagnitude higher. Both the similarity and difference in the PDF compared to\nthose derived from solar neighbourhood clouds match predictions of turbulent\ncloud models given the high-pressure environment of the CMZ. The PDF shows a\nsmall deviation from log-normal at high column densities confirming the youth\nof G0.253+0.016.

Finally, an explicit\nconstruction for LRCs attaining this upper bound is presented over the finite\nfield $\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$, where $m\\geq n_1r$. Based on these results, the\nlargest possible minimum distance for all LRCs with $r \\le \\sqrt{n}-1$ has been\ndefinitely determined, which is of great significance in practical use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 05:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-04"}

We\nattempt to characterize the influence of pore shape for capillary infiltration\nby means of Lattice Boltzmann simulations in 2D with reactive boundaries\nleading to surface growth and ultimately to pore closure. The systems under\ninvestigation consist of single channels with different simplified\nmorphologies: namely, periodic profiles with sinusoidal, step-shaped and\nzig-zag walls, as well as constrictions and expansions with rectangular, convex\nand concave steps. This is a useful way to decompose the complexity of typical\nporous media into basic structures. The simulations show that the minimum\nradius alone fails to characterize properly the infiltration dynamics. The\nstructure of the channels emerge as the dominant property controlling the\nprocess. A factor responsible for this behavior is identified as being the\noccurrence of pinning of the contact line. It turns out that the optimal\nconfiguration for the pore structure arises from the packing of large particles\nwith round shapes. In this case, the probability to have flow paths wide and\nstraight is higher. Faceted surfaces presenting sharp edges should be avoided\nbecause of the phenomenon of pinning near narrow-to-wide parts.

While many\ndifferent variants of the reaction-diffusion idea have been published over the\nyears, the most commonly used recent models are based on non-dispersive\nreaction rates and non- dispersive diffusion. The other class of models is\nbased on the idea that degradation is controlled by first-order reactions with\nwidely distributed (dispersive) reaction rates. We demonstrate that these two\nclasses give fundamentally different predictions for the stochastic degradation\nand recovery of nanoscale devices, therefore providing the ultimate modeling\nbenchmark. Using de- tailed experimental time-dependent defect spectroscopy\n(TDDS) data obtained on such nanoscale devices, we investigate the\ncompatibility of these models with experiment. Our results show that the\ndiffusion of hydrogen (or any other species) is unlikely to be the limiting\naspect that determines degradation. On the other hand, the data are fully\nconsistent with reaction-limited models. We finally argue that only the correct\nunderstanding of the physical mechanisms leading to the significant\ndevice-to-device variation observed in the degradation in nanoscale devices\nwill enable accurate reliability projections and device optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 08:15:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

While it is possible to predict its position\nby using effective models specifically built to reproduce some of the features\nof the underlying theory (QCD), the quality of the predictions (\\textit{e.g.},\nthe CEP position) obtained by such effective models, depends on whether solving\nthe model equations constitute a well- or ill-posed inverse problem.\n  Considering these predictions as being inverse problems provides tools to\nevaluate if the problem is ill-conditioned, meaning that infinitesimal\nvariations of the inputs of the model can cause comparatively large variations\nof the predictions. If it is ill-conditioned, it has major consequences because\nof finite variations that could come from experimental and/or theoretical\nerrors.\n  In the following, we shall apply such a reasoning on the predictions of a\nparticular Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model within the mean field + ring\napproximations, with special attention to the prediction of the chiral CEP\nposition in the $(T-\\mu)$ plane.

We proved how the\ndefinition of passive galaxy depends on the IMF adopted in the models and on\nthe assumed sSFR threshold. We find that ETGs cannot be distinguished from the\nother morphological classes on the basis of their low sSFR, irrespective of the\nIMF adopted in the models. Using the sample of 1302 galaxies morphologically\nclassified into spheroidal galaxies (ETGs) and not spheroidal galaxies (LTGs),\nwe find that their fractions are constant over the redshift range 0.6<z<2.5\n(20-30% ETGs vs 70-80% LTGs). However, at z<1 these fractions change among the\npopulation of the most massive (M*>=10^(11) M_sol) galaxies, with the fraction\nof massive ETGs rising up to 40% and the fraction of massive LTGs decreasing\ndown to 60%. Moreover, we find that the number density and the stellar mass\ndensity of the whole population of massive galaxies increase almost by a factor\nof ~10 between 0.6<z<2.5, with a faster increase of these densities for the\nETGs than for the LTGs. Finally, we find that the number density of the\nhighest-mass galaxies (M*>3-4x10^(11) M_sol) both ETGs and LTGs do not increase\nsince z~2.5, contrary to the lower mass galaxies. This suggests that the\npopulation of the most massive galaxies formed at z>2.5-3 and that the assembly\nof such high-mass galaxies is not effective at lower redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 10:46:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 13:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}

Ages derived\nfrom the two different indices by means of the comparison with stellar\npopulation synthesis models, are not consistent with each other for at least\nnine galaxies (60 per cent of the sample), while for the remaining six\ngalaxies, the ages derived from their global spectral energy distribution (SED)\nfitting are not consistent with those derived from the two indices. We then\nhypothesized that the stellar content of many galaxies is made of two stellar\ncomponents with different ages. The double-component analysis, performed by\ntaking into account both the index values and the observed SED, fully explains\nthe observational data and improves the results of the standard one-component\nSED fitting in 9 out of the 15 objects, i.e. those for which the two indices\npoint towards two different ages. In all of them, the bulk of the mass belongs\nto rather evolved stars, while a small mass fraction is many Gyr younger. In\nsome cases, thanks to the sensitivity of the H+K(CaII) index, we find that the\nminor younger component reveals signs of recent star formation. The\ndistribution of the ages of the younger stellar components appears uniformly in\ntime and this suggests that small amounts of star formation could be common\nduring the evolution of high-z ETGs. We argue the possibility that these new\nstar formation episodes could be frequently triggered by internal causes due to\nthe presence of small gas reservoir.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 10:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Applying Gaussian fitting\nprocedures to the observed line profiles, Doppler velocity, intensity, line\nwidth (FWHM) and electron density have been estimated over CH and adjacent QS\nregion of a North Polar Coronal Hole (NPCH). The aim of this study is to\nidentify the coronal funnels based on spectral signatures. Excess width regions\n(excess FWHM above a threshold level) have been identified in QS and CH. The\nplasma flow inversion (average red-shifts changing to blue-shifts at a specific\nheight) in CH and excess width regions of QS take place at ~\n5.01$\\times$10$^{5}$ K. Furthermore, high density concentration in excess width\nregions of QS provides an indication that these regions are the footprints of\ncoronal funnels.

In terms\nof the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit criterion, although all of the eight\nhazard maps differ significantly from the distribution of the observed ground\nshaking reported in the available Italian databases, the NDSHA approach appears\nto outscore significantly the PSHA one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 12:02:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 12:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

We give a quantitative account of how\nthis mobility enhancement is due to the non-degeneracy of the two-dimensional\nelectron gas system in SLM at accessible temperatures. Using our charged\nimpurity scattering model [Ong and Fischetti, Phys. Rev.

The\ngalaxies used in this first method were selected from the SDSS-DR9, among those\nhaving reliable photometry and accurate estimation of photometric redshifts.\nThe results are largely independent of the galactic cut applied. At |b|>20\ndeg., the sample contains 56,985 clusters in the redshift range 0.05<z<0.68\n(the mean redshift is 0.30) and ~5.3x10^6 galaxies. The second method computes\nthe contribution of dust in clusters of galaxies to the far infrared sky. That\nis estimated indirectly by measuring the effect of clusters in the E(B-V)\nextinction map.\n  Using the first method, we did not find any dependence with clustercentric\ndistance in the colours of background galaxies. This allows us to constrain the\nmass of dust in the intracluster media, M_dust<8.4x10^9 M_sun (95% C.L.) within\na cluster radius of 3 Mpc. With the second method, which averages the\nextinction of all clusters, we find a surface integral of the excess of colour\ng-i of 3.4+/-0.1 millimag Mpc^2. This is equivalent to ~60 times the far\ninfrared luminosity of a Milky Way-like galaxy. By assumming similar properties\nfor the dust, we can estimate a total dust mass per cluster of ~2x10^9 M_sun,\nwhich is compatible with the hypothesis that the dust is within the spiral\ngalaxies of a cluster. Separating the clusters in 5x5 bins in redshift and\nrichness, we confirm previous findings of a clear increase in luminosity with a\nredshift that agrees with the trend expected from current models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 15:27:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 14:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

With Spitzer data and 2MASS\nphotometry, we identify and classify young stellar objects (YSOs) with dusty\ncircumstellar disks and/or envelopes in Mon OB1 East by their infrared-excess\nemission and study their distribution with respect to cloud material. We find a\ncorrelation between the local surface density of YSOs and column density of\nmolecular gas as traced by dust extinction that is roughly described as a power\nlaw in these quantities. NGC 2264 follows a power law index of ~2.7, exhibiting\na large YSO surface density for a given gas column density.

Our hypothesis is that the robustness and\nfragility of the Internet can be attributed to the inherent dynamics of the PSN\nfeedback mechanism called the congestion window size, or \\textit{cwnd}. By\nvarying the data input into the PSN system, we investigate the possible\nself-organization of attractors in cwnd temporal dynamics and discuss the\nadaptability and robustness of PSNs. The present study provides an example of\nAshby's Law of Requisite Variety in action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 00:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

These changes\nmay cause systematic bias in eGFR reported in routinely collected data; even\nthough laboratory reported eGFR values have a correction factor applied.\n  Design: An algorithm to detect changes in SCr which affect eGFR calculation\nmethod by comparing the mapping of SCr values on to eGFR values across a\ntime-series of paired eGFR and SCr measurements.\n  Setting: Routinely collected primary care data from 20,000 people with the\nrichest renal function data from the Quality Improvement in Chronic Kidney\nDisease (QICKD) trial.\n  Results: The algorithm identified a change in eGFR calculation method in 80\n(63%) of the 127 included practices. This change was identified in 4,736\n(23.7%) patient time series analysed. This change in calibration method was\nfound to cause a significant step change in reported eGFR values producing a\nsystematic bias. eGFR values could not be recalibrated by applying the\nModification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation to the laboratory\nreported SCr values.\n  Conclusions: This algorithm can identify laboratory changes in eGFR\ncalculation methods and changes in SCr assay. Failure to account for these\nchanges may misconstrue renal function changes over time. Researchers using\nroutine eGFR data should account for these effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 09:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

Unfortunately the majority of existing post marketing\nsurveillance algorithms measure how dependant or associated an event is on the\npresence of a drug rather than measuring causality. In this paper we\ninvestigate potential attributes that can be used in causal inference to\nidentify side effects based on the Bradford-Hill causality criteria. Potential\nattributes are developed by considering five of the causality criteria and\nfeature selection is applied to identify the most suitable of these attributes\nfor detecting side effects.

The dimensionality effects of\nthe blackbody radiation has been the subject of considerable research activity\nin recent years. These studies are still somewhat fragmentary, pos- ing\nformidable qualitative and quantitative problems for various scientific and\ntechnological areas. In this work we carry out an information-theoretical\nanalysis of the spectral energy density of a d-dimensional blackbody at\ntemperature T by means of various entropy-like quantities (disequilibrium,\nShannon entropy, Fisher information) as well as by three (dimensionless)\ncomplexity measures (Cr\\'amer-Rao, Fisher-Shannon and LMC). All these\nfrequency-functional quantities are calculated and discussed in terms of\ntemperature and dimensionality. It is shown that all three measures of\ncomplexity have an universal character in the sense that they depend neither on\ntemperature nor on the Planck and Boltzmann constants, but only on the the\nspace dimensionality d. Moreover, they decrease when d is increasing; in\nparticular, the values 2.28415, 1.90979 and 1.17685 are found for the\nCr\\'amer-Rao, Fisher-Shannon and LMC measures of complexity of the\n3-dimensional blackbody radiation, respectively. In addition, beyond the\nfrequency at which the spectral density is maximum (which follows the\nwell-known Wien displacement law), three further characteristic frequencies are\ndefined in terms of the previous entropy quantities; they are shown to obey\nWien-like laws. The potential usefulness of these distinctive features of the\nblackbody spectrum is physically discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 13:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}
