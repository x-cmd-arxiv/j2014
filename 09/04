We test the performance of our new methodology\nwith the PDFs provided by the ALHAMBRA photometric survey. The merger fractions\nand rates from the ALHAMBRA survey are in excellent agreement with those from\nspectroscopic work, both for the general population and for red and blue\ngalaxies. With the merger rate of bright (M_B <= -20 - 1.1z) galaxies evolving\nas (1+z)^n, the power-law index n is larger for blue galaxies (n = 2.7 +- 0.5)\nthan for red galaxies (n = 1.3 +- 0.4), confirming previous results.\nIntegrating the merger rate over cosmic time, we find that the average number\nof mergers per galaxy since z = 1 is N_m = 0.57 +- 0.05 for red galaxies and\nN_m = 0.26 +- 0.02 for blue galaxies.

We constrain the\nscaling relations of molecular gas depletion time scale (tdepl) and gas to\nstellar mass ratio (Mmolgas/M*) of SFGs near the star formation main-sequence\nwith redshift, specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass (M*). The\nCO- and dust-based scaling relations agree remarkably well. This suggests that\nthe CO-H2 mass conversion factor varies little within 0.6dex of the main\nsequence (sSFR(ms,z,M*)), and less than 0.3dex throughout this redshift range.\nThis study builds on and strengthens the results of earlier work. We find that\ntdepl scales as (1+z)^-0.3 *(sSFR/sSFR(ms,z,M*))^-0.5, with little dependence\non M*. The resulting steep redshift dependence of Mmolgas/M* ~(1+z)^3 mirrors\nthat of the sSFR and probably reflects the gas supply rate. The decreasing gas\nfractions at high M* are driven by the flattening of the SFR-M* relation.\nThroughout the redshift range probed a larger sSFR at constant M* is due to a\ncombination of an increasing gas fraction and a decreasing depletion time\nscale. As a result galaxy integrated samples of the Mmolgas-SFR rate relation\nexhibit a super-linear slope, which increases with the range of sSFR. With\nthese new relations it is now possible to determine Mmolgas with an accuracy of\n0.1dex in relative terms, and 0.2dex including systematic uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 17:07:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Dec 2014 17:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The key to this formalism is a set of correspondence relations that\nmaps all the field degrees of freedom in the Horava-Lifshitz gravity theory to\nexternal background (source) fields among others in the effective action of the\nquantum Hall effect, according to their symmetry transformation properties. We\noriginally derive the map as a holographic dictionary, but its form is\nindependent of the existence of holographic duality. This paves the way for the\napplication of Horava-Lifshitz holography on fractional quantum Hall effect.\nUsing the simplest holographic Chern-Simons model, we compute the low energy\neffective action at leading orders and show that it captures universal\nelectromagnetic and geometric properties of quantum Hall states, including the\nWen-Zee shift, Hall viscosity, angular momentum density and their relations. We\nidentify the shift function in Horava-Lifshitz gravity theory as minus of\nguiding center velocity and conjugate to guiding center momentum. This enables\nus to distinguish guiding center angular momentum density from the internal\none, which is the sum of Landau orbit spin and intrinsic (topological) spin of\nthe composite particles. Our effective action shows that Hall viscosity is\nminus half of the internal angular momentum density and proportional to Wen-Zee\nshift, and Hall bulk viscosity is half of the guiding center angular momentum\ndensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 17:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

When the stability requirements are fulfilled, the\nprotection against a quench must still be considered. A main factor in the\ndesign of quench protection systems is the resistance growth rate in the magnet\nfollowing a quench. The usual method for determining the resistance growth in\nimpregnated coils is to calculate the longitudinal velocity with which the\nnormal zone propagates in the conductor along the coil windings.\n  Here, we present a 2D numerical model for predicting the normal zone\npropagation velocity in Al stabilized Rutherford NbTi cables with large cross\nsection. By solving two coupled differential equations under adiabatic\nconditions, the model takes into account the thermal diffusion and the current\nredistribution process following a quench. Both the temperature and magnetic\nfield dependencies of the superconductor and the metal cladding materials\nproperties are included. Unlike common normal zone propagation analyses, we\nstudy the influence of the thickness of the cladding on the propagation\nvelocity for varying operating current and magnetic field.\n  To assist in the comprehension of the numerical results, we also introduce an\nanalytical formula for the longitudinal normal zone propagation. The analysis\ndistinguishes between low-current and high-current regimes of normal zone\npropagation, depending on the ratio between the characteristic times of thermal\nand magnetic diffusion. We show that above a certain thickness, the cladding\nacts as a heat sink with a limited contribution to the acceleration of the\npropagation velocity with respect to the cladding geometry. Both numerical and\nanalytical results show good agreement with experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 18:15:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-04"}

The input distributions of the two domains are significantly\ndifferent. The problem is to learn a predictor for the target domain to predict\nthe structured outputs from the input. Due to the limited number of outputs\navailable for the samples form the target domain, it is difficult to directly\nlearn the predictor from the target domain, thus it is necessary to use the\noutput information available in source domain. We propose to learn the target\ndomain predictor by adapting a auxiliary predictor trained by using source\ndomain data to the target domain. The adaptation is implemented by adding a\ndelta function on the basis of the auxiliary predictor.

For models that\nincorporate AGB yields, we find that intermediate-mass yields (with a $^{22}$Ne\nneutron source) alone do not reproduce the light-to-heavy $s$-element ratios\nfor M4 and M22, and that a small contribution from models with a $^{13}$C\npocket is required. With our assumption that $^{13}$C pockets form for initial\nmasses below a transition range between 3.0 and 3.5 M$_\\odot$, we match the\nlight-to-heavy s-element ratio in the s-process residual of M22 and predict a\nminimum enrichment timescale of between 240 and 360 Myr. Our predicted value is\nconsistent with the 300 Myr upper limit age difference between the two groups\nderived from isochrone fitting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 20:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

We formulate a criterion for the existence\nof such conducting edge states at the domain walls. For example, for a\nspontaneously layer polarized state at filling factor $\\nu=2$, domain walls\nbetween regions of opposite polarization carry conducting edge modes. A\nmicroscopic analysis shows that lattice-scale interactions can favor such a\nlayer polarized state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 20:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 08:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

The results of our 3-D dynamical models reveal certain aspects of high\nresolution transmission spectra that are not present in simple 1-D models. We\nfind that the hottest planets experience strong substellar to anti-stellar\n(SSAS) winds, resulting in transmission spectra with net blue shifts of up to 3\nkm s$^{-1}$, whereas less irradiated planets show almost no net Doppler shifts.\nCompared to 1-D models, peak line strengths are significantly reduced for the\nhottest atmospheres owing to Doppler broadening from a combination of rotation\n(which is faster for close-in planets under the assumption of tidal locking)\nand atmospheric winds. Finally, high resolution transmission spectra may be\nuseful in studying the atmospheres of exoplanets with optically thick clouds\nsince line cores for very strong transitions should remain optically thick to\nvery high altitude.

We consider both uniform density surroundings, and a cluster\nembedded in a 10^8 solar mass NFW halo. HMXBs in a constant density environment\nproduce negligible enhanced ionization because of their high-energy SEDs and\nshort lifetimes.

These effects have been widely observed\nin topological insulators. In this article, we review recent progresses in both\ntheory and experiment of weak (anti-)localization in topological insulators,\nwhere the quasiparticles are described as Dirac fermions.

The bulk states in a\ntopological insulator thin film can exhibit the weak localization effect, quite\ndifferent from other system with strong spin-orbit interaction.

The widely accepted rotating vector model (RVM) is an\napproximation in which the line of sight is fixed and the field line is not\nstrictly tangent to it. We refer to an exact treatment (Gangadhara 2004) as the\ntangent model. In the tangent model (but not in the RVM) the visible point\nchanges as a function of pulsar rotational phase, $\\psi$, defining a trajectory\non a sphere of radius $r$. We solve for the trajectory and for the angular\nvelocity of the visible point around it. We note the recent claim that this\nmotion is observable using interstellar holography (Pen et al. 2014). We\nestimate the error introduced by use of the RVM and find that it is significant\nfor pulsars with emission over a wide range of $\\psi$.

Using H-alpha\nDoppler observations, we derive the three-dimensional oscillation velocities at\ndifferent heights along the prominence axis. The results indicate that the\nprominence has a larger oscillation amplitude and damping time at higher\naltitude, but the periods at different heights are the same (i.e., 13.5\nminutes). This suggests that the prominence oscillates like a linear vertical\nrigid body with one end anchored on the Sun. One of the filaments shows weak\ntransverse oscillation after the passing of the shock, which is possibly due to\nthe low altitude of the filament and the weakening (due to reflection) of the\nshock wave before the interaction. Large amplitude longitudinal oscillation is\nobserved in the other filament after the passing of the shock wave. The\nvelocity amplitude and period are about 26.8 km/s and 80.3 minutes,\nrespectively. We propose that the orientation of a filament or prominence\nrelative to the normal vector of the incoming shock should be an important\nfactor for launching transverse or longitudinal filament oscillations. In\naddition, the restoring forces of the transverse prominence are most likely due\nto the coupling of gravity and magnetic tension of the supporting magnetic\nfield, while that for the longitudinal filament oscillation is probably the\nresultant force of gravity and magnetic pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 02:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We applied the MEGNO\ntechnique to identify regions in the phase space where a third planet can\nmaintain quasi-periodic orbits, and assessed the long-term stability of the\nthree-planet system by integrating the entire 5 bodies (binary + planets) for\n10 Myr. We identified several stable regions between the two known planets as\nwell as a region beyond the orbit of Kepler-47c where the orbit of the third\nplanet could be stable. To constrain the orbit of this planet, we used the\nmeasured duration of the unexplained transit event ($\\sim 4.15$ hours) and\ncompared that with the transit duration of the third planet in an ensemble of\nstable orbits. To remove the degeneracy among the orbits with similar transit\ndurations, we considered the planet to be in a circular orbit and calculated\nits period analytically. The latter places an upper limit of 424 days on the\norbital period of the third planet.

We investigate the dynamical\ndark energy models which can produce the same CMB angular power spectra as that\nof the LCDM model with less than a sub-percent level accuracy. If one adopts\nthe dynamical DE models using the so-called Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL)\nparametrization, w = w0 + wa(1-a), then one obtains models (w0,wa)=\n(-0.8,-0.767), (-0.9,-0.375), (-1.1,0.355), (-1.2,0.688) named as M8, M9, M11,\nand M12, respectively. The differences of the growth rate, f which is related\nto the redshift space distortions (RSD) between different DE models and the\nLCDM model are about 0.2% only at z=0. The difference of f between M8 (M9, M11,\nM12) and the LCDM model becomes maximum at z ~ 0.25 with -2.4 (-1.2, 1.2,\n2.5)%. This is a scale-independent quantity. One can investigate the one-loop\ncorrection of the matter power spectrum of each model using the standard\nperturbation theory in order to probe the scale-dependent quantity in the\nquasi-linear regime ({\\it i.e.} k < 0.4 h/Mpc).

Charge conjugation $C$ is presented by a\npseudoautomorphism of the complex Clifford algebra. This description of the\noperation $C$ allows one to distinguish charged and neutral particles including\nparticle-antiparticle interchange and truly neutral particles. Spin and charge\nmultiplets, based on the interlocking representations of the Lorentz group, are\nintroduced. A central point of the work is a correspondence between Wigner\ndefinition of elementary particle as an irreducible representation of the\nPoincar\\'{e} group and $SU(3)$-description (quark scheme) of the particle as a\nvector of the supermultiplet (irreducible representation of $SU(3)$). This\ncorrespondence is realized on the ground of a spin-charge Hilbert space. Basic\nhadron supermultiplets of $SU(3)$-theory (baryon octet and two meson octets)\nare studied in this framework. It is shown that quark phenomenologies are\nnaturally incorporated into presented scheme. The relationship between mass and\nspin is established.

Specifically, the $J'-J_2$ plane of this model,\nwhich connects the $J_1-J_2$ chain and the anisotropic triangular lattice\nHeisenberg model, is explored using these quantities. Through the use of a\nquantum fidelity associated with the first excited-state, in addition to the\nconventional ground-state fidelity, the BKT-type transition and Majumdar-Ghosh\npoint of the $J_1-J_2$ chain ($J'=0$) are found to extend into the $J'-J_2$\nplane and connect with points on the $J_2=0$ axis thereby forming bounded\nregions in the phase diagram.

In this work we explore the possibility of having such a\ndark matter candidate within the framework of a radiative neutrino mass model.\nThe model is a simple extension of the standard model by an additional $U(1)_X$\ngauge symmetry where the standard model neutrino masses arise both at tree\nlevel as well as radiatively by the anomaly free addition of one singlet\nfermion $N_R$ and two triplet fermions $\\Sigma_{1R}, \\Sigma_{2R}$ with suitable\nHiggs scalars. The spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking is achieved in such a\nway which results in a residual $Z_2$ symmetry and hence providing a stable\ncold dark matter candidate. We show that the singlet fermionic dark matter\ncandidate in our model can give rise to the galactic center gamma ray excess.\nThe parameter space which simultaneously satisfy the constraints on relic\ndensity, direct detection scattering as well as collider bounds essentially\ncorresponds to an s-wave resonance where the gauge boson mass $m_X$ is\napproximately twice that of dark matter mass $m_{\\chi}$. We also discuss the\ncompatibility of such a light fermion singlet dark matter with light neutrino\nmass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 11:38:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 14:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

We propose a test procedure based on a U-statistic of order 2 which\nis weighted in an optimal way.

We start with the following notion due to N.Thi\\'ery and the second\nauthor. A \\emph{monomorphic decomposition} of a relational structure $R$ is a\npartition of its domain $V(R)$ into a family of sets $(V_x)_{x\\in X}$ such that\nthe restrictions of $R$ to two finite subsets $A$ and $A'$ of $V(R)$ are\nisomorphic provided that the traces $A\\cap V_x$ and $A'\\cap V_x$ have the same\nsize for each $x\\in X$.

Some quantitative and qualitative measures describe the pattern of a\nmusic signal, vary from one to another. Same musical recital, when played by\ndifferent instrumentalists, generates different types of music patterns. The\nreason behind various patterns is the psychoacoustic measures - Dynamics,\nTimber, Tonality and Rhythm, varies in each time. However, the psycho-acoustic\nstudy of the music signals does not reveal any idea about the similarity\nbetween the signals. For such cases, study of synchronization of long-term\nnonlinear dynamics may provide effective results. In this context, phase\nsynchronization (PS) is one of the measures to show synchronization between two\nnon-identical signals. In fact, it is very critical to investigate any other\nkind of synchronization for experimental condition, because those are\ncompletely non identical signals. Also, there exists equivalence between the\nphases and the distances of the diagonal line in Recurrence plot (RP) of the\nsignals, which is quantifiable by the recurrence quantification measure\ntau-recurrence rate. This paper considers two nonlinear music signals based on\nsame raga played by two eminent sitar instrumentalists as two non-identical\nsources. The psycho-acoustic study shows how the Dynamics, Timber, Tonality and\nRhythm vary for the two music signals. Then, long term analysis in the form of\nphase space reconstruction is performed, which reveals the chaotic phase spaces\nfor both the signals. From the RP of both the phase spaces, tau-recurrence rate\nis calculated. Finally by the correlation of normalized tau-recurrence rate of\ntheir 3D phase spaces and the PS of the two music signals has been established.\nThe numerical results well support the analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 13:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The detailed\nmechanism for the frustration is investigated via an analysis of the\nanisotropic pair distributions of the confined fluid, as obtained from integral\nequation theory for inhomogeneous fluids at pair correlation level within the\nanisotropic Percus-Yevick approximation. By examining the mean forces that\narise from interparticle collisions around the periphery of each particle in\nthe slit, we calculate the principal components of the mean force for the\ndensity profile - each component being the sum of collisional forces on a\nparticle's hemisphere facing either surface. The variations of these components\nwith the slit width give rise to rather intricate changes in the layer\nstructure between the surfaces, but, as shown in this paper, the basis of these\nvariations can be easily understood qualitatively and often also\nsemi-quantitatively. It is found that the ordering of the fluid is in essence\ngoverned locally by the packing constraints at each single solid-fluid\ninterface. A simple superposition of forces due to the presence of each surface\ngives surprisingly good estimates of the density profiles, but there remain\nnontrivial confinement effects that cannot be explained by superposition, most\nnotably the magnitude of the excess adsorption of particles in the slit\nrelative to bulk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 14:13:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

In this scenario, there is an\nincreasing interest in both multi-patch and multi-group models for such\ndiseases. In this work, we study the dynamics of a vector borne disease within\na class of multi-group models that extends the classical Bailey-Dietz model.\nThis class includes many of the proposed models in the literature, and it can\naccommodate various functional forms of the infection force. For such models,\nthe vector-host/host-vector contact network topology gives rise to a bipartite\ngraph which has different properties from the ones usually found in directly\ntransmitted diseases. Under the assumption that the contact network is strongly\nconnected, we can define the basic reproductive number $\\mathcal{R}_0$ and show\nthat this system has only two equilibria: the so called disease free\nequilibrium (DFE); and a unique interior equilibrium---usually termed the\nendemic equilibrium (EE)---that exists if, and only if, $\\mathcal{R}_0>1$.
