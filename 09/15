However it suffers from low conversion efficiencies as the control of\nthe HHG spectral and temporal characteristics requires manipulating electron\ntrajectories on attosecond time scale. The phase matching mechanism has been\nemployed to selectively enhance specific quantum paths leading to HHG. A few\nimportant fundamental questions remain open, among those how much of the\nenhancement can be achieved by the single-emitter and what is the role of\ncorrelations (or the electronic structure) in the selectivity and control of\nHHG generation. Here we address those questions by examining computationally\nthe possibility of optimizing the HHG spectrum of isolated Hydrogen and Helium\natoms by shaping the slowly varying envelope of a 800 nm, 200-cycles long laser\npulse. The spectra are computed with a fully quantum mechanical description, by\nexplicitly computing the time-dependent dipole moment of the systems using a\nfirst-principles time-dependent density-functional approach (exact for the case\nof H). The sought optimization corresponds to the selective enhancement of\nsingle harmonics, which we find to be significant. This selectivity is entirely\ndue to the single atom response, and not due to any propagation or\nphase-matching effect. In fact, this single-emitter enhancement adds to the\nphase-matching techniques to achieving even larger HHG enhancement factors.\nMoreover, we see that the electronic correlation plays a role in the\ndetermining the degree of optimization that can be obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Sep 2014 16:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}

In this work, we apply DCNs as\nframe-based recognizers for video recognition. Our preliminary studies,\nhowever, show that video corpora with complete ground truth are usually not\nlarge and diverse enough to learn a robust model. The networks trained directly\non the video data set suffer from significant overfitting and have poor\nrecognition rate on the test set. The same lack-of-training-sample problem\nlimits the usage of deep models on a wide range of computer vision problems\nwhere obtaining training data are difficult. To overcome the problem, we\nperform transfer learning from images to videos to utilize the knowledge in the\nweakly labeled image corpus for video recognition. The image corpus help to\nlearn important visual patterns for natural images, while these patterns are\nignored by models trained only on the video corpus. Therefore, the resultant\nnetworks have better generalizability and better recognition rate. We show that\nby means of transfer learning from image to video, we can learn a frame-based\nrecognizer with only 4k videos. Because the image corpus is weakly labeled, the\nentire learning process requires only 4k annotated instances, which is far less\nthan the million scale image data sets required by previous works. The same\napproach may be applied to other visual recognition tasks where only scarce\ntraining data is available, and it improves the applicability of DCNs in\nvarious computer vision problems.

The II term is computed from Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations on\nthe basis of the implicit solvent model of electrolytes using hard sphere ions\nwith Pauling radii. The IW term is computed on the basis of Born's treatment of\nsolvation using experimental hydration free energies. The two terms are coupled\nthrough the concentration-dependent dielectric constant of the electrolyte.\nWith this approach we are able to reproduce the nonmonotonic concentration\ndependence of the mean activity coefficient of pure electrolytes qualitatively\nwithout using adjustable parameters.

The difference of the excess chemical potentials of cations and anions\n(the ratio of activity coefficients) is determined by asymmetries in the\nproperties of the two ions: charge, radius, and hydration free energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 07:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}

Previous studies suggested\nthat the SiO abundance decreases with the evolution of a massive young stellar\nobject probably because of a decay of jet activity, as witnessed in low-mass\nstar-forming regions. We investigate the SiO excitation conditions and its\nabundance in outflows from a sample of massive young stellar objects through\nobservations of the SiO(8-7) and CO(4-3) lines with the APEX telescope. Through\na non-LTE analysis, we find that the excitation conditions of SiO increase with\nthe velocity of the emitting gas.

For the sources in our\nsample we find no significant variation of the SiO abundance with evolution for\na bolometric luminosity-to-mass ratio of between 4 and 50 $L_\\odot/M_\\odot$. We\nalso find a weak increase of the SiO(8-7) luminosity with the bolometric\nluminosity-to-mass ratio.

We use the LPCODE stellar\nevolution code with the GNA generalized version of the mixing length theory to\ncompute Red Giant models and we introduce fingering convection using the BGS\nprescription. The results show that, although the fingering zone now reaches\nthe outer dynamical convective zone, the efficiency of the mixing is not enough\nto account for the observations. The fingering mixing coefficient should be\nincreased by two orders of magnitude for the needed surface abundances to be\nreached.

In the standard cold dark matter\n(CDM) model, spheroids are formed through mergers in a strongly hierarchical\nscenario, and also in the early universe through dynamical friction in clumpy\ngalaxies. More secularly, pseudo-bulges are formed by the inner vertical\nresonance with bars. The high efficiency of bulge formation is in tension with\nobservations in the local universe of a large amount of bulge-less spiral\ngalaxies. In the present work, the formation of bulges in very gas-rich\ngalaxies, as those in the early universe, is studied in the Milgrom's MOdified\nNewtonian Dynamics (MOND), through multi-grid simulations of the non-linear\ngravity, including the gas dissipation, star formation and feedback.\n  Clumpy disks are rapidly formed, as in their Newtonian equivalent systems.\nHowever, the dynamical friction is not as efficient, in the absence of dark\nmatter halos, and the clumps have no time to coalesce into the center to form\nbulges, before they are eroded by stellar feedback and shear forces. Previous\nwork has established that mergers are less frequent in MOND, and classical\nbulges are expected less massive. It is now shown that gas-rich clumpy galaxies\nin the early universe do not form bulges.\n  Since pseudo-bulges are formed with a similar rate as in the Newtonian\nequivalent systems, it can be expected that the contribution of pseudo-bulges\nis significantly higher in MOND.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 11:44:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 11:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

This issue is compounded by a severe lack of\nnew antibiotics reaching the market. The significant rise in clinical\nresistance to antibiotics is especially problematic in nosocomial infections,\nwhere already vulnerable patients may fail to respond to treatment, causing\neven greater health concern. A recent focus has been on the development of\nanti-virulence drugs as a second line of defence in the treatment of\nantibiotic-resistant infections. This treatment, which weakens bacteria by\nreducing their virulence rather than killing them, should allow infections to\nbe cleared through the body's natural defence mechanisms. In this way there\nshould be little to no selective pressure exerted on the organism and, as such,\na predominantly resistant population would be unlikely to emerge. However, much\ncontroversy surrounds this approach with many believing it would not be\npowerful enough to clear existing infections, restricting its potential\napplication to prophylaxis. We have developed a mathematical model that\nprovides a theoretical framework to reveal the circumstances under which\nanti-virulence drugs may or may not be successful. We demonstrate that by\nharnessing and combining the advantages of antibiotics with those provided by\nanti-virulence drugs, given infection-specific parameters, it is possible to\nidentify treatment strategies that would efficiently clear bacterial\ninfections, while preventing the emergence of resistant subpopulations. Our\nfindings strongly support the continuation of research into anti-virulence\ndrugs and demonstrate that their applicability may reach beyond infection\nprevention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 13:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}

In the present manuscript, a new approach is\nconsidered in the framework of greedy algorithms. The noise is split into two\ncomponents: a) the inlier bounded noise and b) the outliers, which are\nexplicitly modeled by employing sparsity arguments. Based on this scheme, a\nnovel efficient algorithm (Greedy Algorithm for Robust Denoising - GARD), is\nderived. GARD alternates between a least square optimization criterion and an\nOrthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) selection step that identifies the outliers.\nThe case where only outliers are present has been studied separately, where\nbounds on the \\textit{Restricted Isometry Property} guarantee that the recovery\nof the signal via GARD is exact.

At very low kinetic\nenergies, both an accurate description of the long-range (LR) region in the\npotential energy surface (PES), and long dynamical propagations, up to\ndistances of 10$^{5}$ a0, are required. Accordingly, calculations have been\ncarried out on the PES by Velilla et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 2008, 129,084307]\nwhich accurately reproduces the LR interactions. Hyperspherical methodology was\nrecently modified in order to allow the accurate inclusion of LR interactions\nwhile minimizing the computational expense. Such implementation is shown\nparticularly suitable for systems involving ions, where the $R^{-4}$ behavior\nlargely extends the range of the potential. We find a reaction rate coefficient\nwhich remains almost constant in a kinetic energy range of more than ten orders\nof magnitude. In particular, the value reached in the Wigner regime, where only\none partial wave is open, is paradoxically the Langevin classical value (within\na few percent) expected at high energies. Results are discussed in terms of\n{\\em universality} and related to the recently published quantum defect theory\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 2013, 110, 213202]. Since the system has small exothermicity\nand a low number of channels, it is possible to test such model in a case where\nthe loss probability at short range is appreciably far from unity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 15:41:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Oct 2014 11:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-07"}

Similar fibril radii and\ntwist-angles at the surface are observed in vitro, suggesting that these\nfeatures are controlled by a similar self-assembly process. In this work, we\npropose a physical mechanism of equilibrium radius control for collagen fibrils\nbased on a radially varying double-twist alignment of tropocollagen within a\ncollagen fibril. The free-energy of alignment is similar to that of liquid\ncrystalline blue phases, and we employ an analytic Euler-Lagrange and numerical\nfree energy minimization to determine the twist-angle between the molecular\naxis and the fibril axis along the radial direction. Competition between the\ndifferent elastic energy components, together with a surface energy, determines\nthe equilibrium radius and twist-angle at the fibril surface. A simplified\nmodel with a twist-angle that is linear with radius is a reasonable\napproximation in some parameter regimes, and explains a power-law dependence of\nradius and twist-angle at the surface as parameters are varied. Fibril radius\nand twist-angle at the surface corresponding to an equilibrium free-energy\nminimum are consistent with existing experimental measurements of collagen\nfibrils.

For correlated preferences, we propose and study a\ngeneral class of hedonic coalition formation games that we call coalition\nformation games with constraints.

Finally,\nwe identify conditions under which the minimum of two possibility measures is a\ncoherent upper probability, or in other words, conditions under which the\nminimum of two possibility measures is an exact upper bound for the\nintersection of the credal sets of those two possibility measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 11:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-12"}

Interestingly, the language comes\nwith a way to represent probability theory concepts and also programming\nstatements. With this language, questions and processes in medicine can be\nrepresented as systems of equations; and solutions to these equations are\nviewed as treatments or previously unknown processes. This language can serve\nas the framework for the creation of a large interactive open-access scientific\ndatabase that allows extensive mathematical medicine computations. It can also\nserve as a basis for exploring ideas related to what could be called\nmetascience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 03:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-18"}

It can collect full spatial diversity and each transmitter transmits\nsignals with the same frequency band, i.e., the range resolution is not\nreduced. However, it needs to transmit multiple OFDM pulses consecutively to\nobtain range profiles for a single swath, which may be too long in time for a\nreasonable swath width. In this letter, we propose a CP based MIMO-OFDM\nsynthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, where each transmitter transmits only a\nsingle OFDM pulse to obtain range profiles for a swath and has the same\nfrequency band, thus the range resolution is not reduced. It is IRCI free and\ncan collect the full spatial diversity if the transmit antennas are\ndistributed. Our main idea is to use circularly shifted Zadoff-Chu sequences as\nthe weighting coefficients in the OFDM pulses for different transmit antennas\nand apply spatial filters with multiple receive antennas to divide the whole\nswath into multiple subswaths, and then each subswath is reconstructed/imaged\nusing our proposed IRCI free range reconstruction method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Sep 2014 20:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}
