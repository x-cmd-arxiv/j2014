Therefore computing exact betweenness\nvalues is impractical in large networks. For static networks, approximation\nbased on randomly sampled paths has been shown to be significantly faster in\npractice. However, for dynamic networks, no approximation algorithm for\nbetweenness centrality is known that improves on static recomputation. We\naddress this deficit by proposing two incremental approximation algorithms (for\nweighted and unweighted connected graphs) which provide a provable guarantee on\nthe absolute approximation error. Processing batches of edge insertions, our\nalgorithms yield significant speedups up to a factor of $10^4$ compared to\nrestarting the approximation. This is enabled by investing memory to store and\nefficiently update shortest paths. As a building block, we also propose an\nasymptotically faster algorithm for updating the SSSP problem in unweighted\ngraphs. Our experimental study shows that our algorithms are the first to make\nin-memory computation of a betweenness ranking practical for million-edge\nsemi-dynamic networks. Moreover, our results show that the accuracy is even\nbetter than the theoretical guarantees in terms of absolutes errors and the\nrank of nodes is well preserved, in particular for those with high betweenness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 16:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-23"}

We acquired at the\nESO VLT high-resolution spectroscopic observations of comets C/2002 T7\n(LINEAR), 73P-C/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, 8P/Tuttle, and, 103P/Hartley 2 when\nthey were close to the Earth (< 0.6 au). Using the observed spectra, we\ndetermined the intensities and the widths of the three [OI] lines. We have\nspatially extracted the spectra in order to achieve the best possible\nresolution of about 1-2\", i.e., nucleocentric projected distances of 100 to 400\nkm depending on the geocentric distance of the comet. We have decontaminated\nthe [OI] green line from C2 lines blends. It is found that the observed G/R\nratio on all four comets varies as a function of nucleocentric projected\ndistance. This is mainly due to the collisional quenching of O(1S) and O(1D) by\nwater molecules in the inner coma. The observed green emission line width is\nabout 2.5 km/s and decreases as the distance from the nucleus increases which\ncan be explained by the varying contribution of CO2 to the O(1S) production in\nthe innermost coma. The photodissociation of CO2 molecules seems to produce\nO(1S) closer to the nucleus while the water molecule forms all the O(1S) and\nO(1D) atoms beyond 1000 km. Thus we conclude that the main parent species\nproducing O(1S) and O(1D) in the inner coma is not always the same. The\nobservations have been interpreted in the framework of the\ncoupled-chemistry-emission model of Bhardwaj & Raghuram (2012) and the upper\nlimits of CO2 relative abundances are derived from the observed G/R ratios.\nMeasuring the [OI] lines could indeed provide a new way to determine the CO2\nrelative abundance in comets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 17:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Such behaviour has been reported before for individual\nsources, but here we demonstrate that very likely most (if not all)\nneutron-star systems behave in a similar manner and possibly even follow a\nuniversal relation. When comparing the neutron-star systems with black-hole\nsystems, it is clear that most black-hole binaries have significantly harder\nspectra at luminosities of 1E34 - 1E35 erg/s. Despite a limited number of data\npoints, there are indications that these spectral differences also extend to\nthe 1E35 - 1E36 erg/s range. This observed difference between the neutron-star\nbinaries and black-hole ones suggests that the spectral properties (between\n0.5-10 keV) at 1E34 - 1E35 erg/s can be used to tentatively determine the\nnature of the accretor in unclassified X-ray binaries.

In this paper, we suggest that a fundamental\nissue has received insufficient exploration: the fact that in science, we don't\njust use math, we make meaning with it in a different way than mathematicians\ndo. In this reflective essay, we explore math as a language and consider the\nlanguage of math in physics through the lens of cognitive linguistics. We begin\nby offering a number of examples that show how the use of math in physics\ndiffers from the use of math as typically found in math classes. We then\nexplore basic concepts in cognitive semantics to show how humans make meaning\nwith language in general. The critical elements are the roles of embodied\ncognition and interpretation in context. Then we show how a theoretical\nframework commonly used in physics education research, resources, is coherent\nwith and extends the ideas of cognitive semantics by connecting embodiment to\nphenomenological primitives and contextual interpretation to the dynamics of\nmeaning making with conceptual resources, epistemological resources, and\naffect. We present these ideas with illustrative case studies of students\nworking on physics problems with math and demonstrate the dynamical nature of\nstudent reasoning with math in physics.

We use analytic and\ncomputational techniques to study the impact on shape measurements of two\natmospheric chromatic effects for ground-based surveys such as the Dark Energy\nSurvey and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST): (i) atmospheric\ndifferential chromatic refraction and (ii) wavelength dependence of seeing. We\ninvestigate the effects of using the point spread function (PSF) measured with\nstars to determine the shapes of galaxies that have different spectral energy\ndistributions than the stars. We find that both chromatic effects lead to\nsignificant biases in galaxy shape measurements for current and future surveys,\nif not corrected. Using simulated galaxy images, we find a form of chromatic\n`model bias' that arises when fitting a galaxy image with a model that has been\nconvolved with a stellar, instead of galactic, point spread function. We show\nthat both forms of atmospheric chromatic biases can be predicted (and\ncorrected) with minimal model bias by applying an ordered set of perturbative\nPSF-level corrections based on machine-learning techniques applied to six-band\nphotometry. Catalog-level corrections do not address the model bias.

In particular, we solve the\nlinearised time dependent Kompaneets equation and consider the oscillatory\nperturbation to be either in the soft photon source or in the heating rate of\nthe plasma. For each case, we self consistently consider the energy balance of\nthe plasma and the soft photon source. The model incorporates the possibility\nof a fraction of the Comptonized photons impinging back into the soft photon\nsource. We find that when the oscillation is due to the soft photon source, the\nvariation of the fractional root mean sqaure (r.m.s) is nearly constant with\nenergy and the time-lags are hard. However, for the case when the oscillation\nis due to variation in the heating rate of the corona, and when a significant\nfraction of the photons impinge back into the soft photon source, the r.m.s\nincreases with energy and the time lags are soft. As an example, we compare the\nresults with the $\\sim 850$ Hz oscillation observed on March 3, 1996 for 4U\n1608-52 and show that both the observed soft time-lags as well as the r.m.s\nversus energy can be well described by such a model where the size of the\nComptonizing plasma is $\\sim 1$ km.

A status update on the data\ndistributions or the compute nodes may have significant repercussions on the\nchoice of which query plan should be running. Ideally, new system architectures\nwould be able to make cost-based decisions about reallocating work, migrating\ndata, etc., and react quickly as real-time status information becomes\navailable. Existing cost-based query optimizers are not incremental in nature,\nand must be run \"from scratch\" upon each status or cost update. Hence, they\ngenerally result in adaptive schemes that can only react slowly to updates.\n  An open question has been whether it is possible to build a cost-based\nre-optimization architecture for adaptive query processing in a streaming or\nrepeated query execution environment, e.g., by incrementally updating optimizer\nstate given new cost information. We show that this can be achieved\nbeneficially, especially for stream processing workloads. Our techniques build\nupon the recently proposed approach of formulating query plan enumeration as a\nset of recursive datalog queries; we develop a variety of novel optimization\napproaches to ensure effective pruning in both static and incremental cases.

Nevertheless, companions at separations between 1 and 100\nmas remain mostly unknown due to intrinsic observational limitations. [...] The\nSouthern MAssive Stars at High angular resolution survey (SMASH+) was designed\nto fill this gap by providing the first systematic interferometric survey of\nGalactic massive stars. We observed 117 O-type stars with VLTI/PIONIER and 162\nO-type stars with NACO/SAM, respectively probing the separation ranges 1-45 and\n30-250mas and brightness contrasts of Delta H < 4 and Delta H < 5. Taking\nadvantage of NACO's field-of-view, we further uniformly searched for visual\ncompanions in an 8''-radius down to Delta H = 8. This paper describes the\nobservations and data analysis, reports the discovery of almost 200 new\ncompanions in the separation range from 1mas to 8'' and presents the catalog of\ndetections, including the first resolved measurements of over a dozen known\nlong-period spectroscopic binaries.\n  Excluding known runaway stars for which no companions are detected, 96\nobjects in our main sample (DEC < 0 deg; H<7.5) were observed both with PIONIER\nand NACO/SAM. The fraction of these stars with at least one resolved companion\nwithin 200mas is 0.53. Accounting for known but unresolved spectroscopic or\neclipsing companions, the multiplicity fraction at separation < 8'' increases\nto f_m = 0.91 +/- 0.03. The fraction of luminosity class V stars that have a\nbound companion reaches 100% at 30mas while their average number of physically\nconnected companions within 8'' is f_c = 2.2 +/- 0.3. This demonstrates that\nmassive stars form nearly exclusively in multiple systems.

Very different, non-classical behavior was observed\nwhen a genetic algorithm (GA) was used to minimize the ion signal at some\npre-determined target time, T. Two qualitatively different control mechanisms\nwere identified for early (T$<1.5$ ps) and late (T$>1.5$ ps) target times.

At present, a\ncomplete census of obscured AGN is still missing. The purpose of this work is\nto assess the reliability of the [NeV] emission line at 3426 A to pick up\nobscured AGN up to z~1 by assuming that [NeV] is a reliable proxy of the\nintrinsic AGN luminosity and using moderately deep X-ray data to characterize\nthe amount of obscuration. A sample of 69 narrow-line (Type 2) AGN at\nz=0.65-1.20 were selected from the 20k-zCOSMOS Bright galaxy sample on the\nbasis of the presence of the [NeV] emission. The X-ray properties of these\ngalaxies were then derived using the Chandra-COSMOS coverage of the field; the\nX-ray-to-[NeV] flux ratio, coupled with X-ray spectral and stacking analyses,\nwas then used to infer whether Compton-thin or Compton-thick absorption were\npresent in these sources. Then the [NeV] luminosity function was computed to\nestimate the space density of Compton-thick (CT) AGN at z~0.8. Twenty-three\nsources were detected by Chandra, and their properties are consistent with\nmoderate obscuration (on average, ~a few 10^{22} cm^-2). The X-ray properties\nof the remaining 46 X-ray undetected Type 2 AGN were derived using X-ray\nstacking analysis. Current data indicate that a fraction as high as ~40% of the\npresent sample is likely to be CT. The space density of CT AGN with\nlogL_2-10keV>43.5 at z=0.83 is (9.1+/-2.1) 10^{-6} Mpc^{-3}, in good agreement\nwith both XRB model expectations and the previously measured space density for\nobjects in a similar redshift and luminosity range. We regard our selection\ntechnique for CT AGN as clean but not complete, since even a mild extinction in\nthe NLR can suppress [NeV] emission. Therefore, our estimate of their space\ndensity should be considered as a lower limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 22:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}

An interesting question to\nanswer is: what is the common functionality genes of a collection of species,\nor conversely, to determine what is specific to a given species when compared\nto other ones belonging in the same genus, family, etc. Investigating such\nproblem means to find both core and pan genomes of a collection of species,\n\\textit{i.e.}, genes in common to all the species vs. the set of all genes in\nall species under consideration. However, obtaining trustworthy core and pan\ngenomes is not an easy task, leading to a large amount of computation, and\nrequiring a rigorous methodology. Surprisingly, as far as we know, this\nmethodology in finding core and pan genomes has not really been deeply\ninvestigated. This research work tries to fill this gap by focusing only on\nchloroplastic genomes, whose reasonable sizes allow a deep study. To achieve\nthis goal, a collection of 99 chloroplasts are considered in this article. Two\nmethodologies have been investigated, respectively based on sequence\nsimilarities and genes names taken from annotation tools.

A constitutive law accounting for\nmechanically-driven collagen fiber reorientation is proposed.

Thus, if simulated annealing with slow temperature change does not\nencounter a difficulty caused by an exponentially long relaxation time at a\nfirst-order phase transition, the same is true for the corresponding process of\nquantum annealing in the adiabatic limit. One of the important differences\nbetween the classical-to-quantum mapping and the converse quantum-to-classical\nmapping is that the Markovian dynamics of a short-range Ising model is mapped\nto a short-range quantum system, but the converse mapping from a short-range\nquantum system to a classical one results in long-range interactions.

We\nfirst focus on the intricacies associated with astrometric estimation using the\ncombination of an Extreme Adaptive Optics system (PALM-3000), a coronagraph and\nan IFS. We introduce two new algorithms. The first one retrieves the stellar\nfocal plane position when the star is occulted by a coronagraphic stop. The\nsecond one yields precise astrometric and spectro-photometric estimates of\nfaint point sources even when they are initially buried in the speckle noise.\nThe second part of our paper is devoted to studying orbital motion in this\nsystem. In order to complement the orbital architectures discussed in the\nliterature, we determine an ensemble of likely Keplerian orbits for HR8799bcde,\nusing a Bayesian analysis with maximally vague priors regarding the overall\nconfiguration of the system. While the astrometric history is currently too\nscarce to formally rule out coplanarity, HR8799d appears to be misaligned with\nrespect to the most likely planes of HR8799bce orbits. This misalignment is\nsufficient to question the strictly coplanar assumption made by various authors\nwhen identifying a Laplace resonance as a potential architecture.

We also show that the solution of\nthe local feasibility tests can be used to synthesize a receding horizon like\ncontroller that achieves the desired closed loop response in a localized manner\nas well. Finally, we formulate the Localized LQR (LLQR) optimal control problem\nand derive an analytic solution for the optimal controller. Through a numerical\nexample, we show that the LLQR optimal controller, with its constraints on\nlocality, settling time, and communication delay, can achieve similar\nperformance as an unconstrained H2 optimal controller, but can be designed and\nimplemented in a localized and distributed way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 03:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-24"}

For the first time a EE is found to be associated with very\nsmall-scale ($\\sim$120 km wide) plasma ejection followed by retraction in the\nchromosphere. These small-scale jets originate from a compact bright-point-like\nstructure of $\\sim$1.5\" size as seen in the IRIS 1330 \\AA\\ images. SDO/AIA and\nSDO/HMI co-observations show that the EE lies in the footpoint of a complex\nloop-like brightening system. The EE is detected in the higher temperature\nchannels of AIA 171 \\AA, 193 \\AA\\ and 131 \\AA\\ suggesting that it reaches a\nhigher temperature of log T$=5.36\\pm0.06$ (K). Brightenings observed in the AIA\nchannels with durations 90--120 seconds are probably caused by the plasma\nejections seen in the chromosphere. The wings of the C II line behave in a\nsimilar manner as the Si IV's indicating close formation temperatures, while\nthe Mg II k wings show additional Doppler-shifted emission. Magnetic\nconvergence or emergence followed by cancellation at a rate of $5\\times10^{14}$\nMx s$^{-1}$ is associated with the EE region. The combined changes of the\nlocations and the flux of different magnetic patches suggest that magnetic\nreconnection must have taken place. Our results challenge several theories put\nforward in the past to explain non-Gaussian line profiles, i.e. EEs. Our case\nstudy on its own, however, cannot reject these theories, thus further in-depth\nstudies on the phenomena producing EEs are required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 06:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

By employing hierarchical feature selection, we can compress the scale\nand dimension of global dictionary, which directly contributes to the decrease\nof computational cost in sparse representation that our approach is strongly\nrooted in. It consists of Gabor wavelets and Extreme Learning Machine\nAuto-Encoder (ELM-AE) hierarchically. For Gabor wavelets part, local features\ncan be extracted at multiple scales and orientations to form Gabor-feature\nbased image, which in turn improves the recognition rate. Besides, in the\npresence of occluded face image, the scale of Gabor-feature based global\ndictionary can be compressed accordingly because redundancies exist in\nGabor-feature based occlusion dictionary. For ELM-AE part, the dimension of\nGabor-feature based global dictionary can be compressed because\nhigh-dimensional face images can be rapidly represented by low-dimensional\nfeature. By introducing L1/2 regularization, our approach can produce sparser\nand more robust representation compared to regularized Sparse Representation\nbased Classification (SRC), which also contributes to the decrease of the\ncomputational cost in sparse representation. In comparison with related work\nsuch as SRC and Gabor-feature based SRC (GSRC), experimental results on a\nvariety of face databases demonstrate the great advantage of our method for\ncomputational cost. Moreover, we also achieve approximate or even better\nrecognition rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 08:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-29"}

During strong outbursts regularly\nobserved from some X-ray pulsars, the X-ray luminosity can be so high, that the\nemerging radiation is able to stop the accreting matter above the surface via\nradiation-dominated shock, and the accretion column begins to rise. This border\nluminosity is usually called the \"critical luminosity\". Here we calculate the\ncritical luminosity as a function of the NS magnetic field strength $B$ using\nexact Compton scattering cross section in strong magnetic field. Influence of\nthe resonant scattering and photon polarization is taken into account for the\nfirst time. We show that the critical luminosity is not a monotonic function of\nthe B-field.

The keys to reproduce this result are a low initial\nwater ice abundance after the pre-collapse phase together with the fact that\natomic oxygen cannot freeze-out and form water ice in regions with T(dust)>15\nK. This requires short prestellar core lifetimes of less than about 0.1Myr. The\nwater vapour profile is shaped through the interplay of FUV photodesorption,\nphotodissociation, and freeze-out. The water vapour line profiles are an\ninvaluable tracer for the FUV photon flux and envelope kinematics.\n  Conclusions: The finding that only a fraction of the oxygen budget is locked\nin water ice can be explained either by a short pre-collapse time of less than\n0.1 Myr at densities of n(H)~1e4 cm-3, or by some other process that resets the\ninitial water ice abundance for the post-collapse phase.

Precise\nband gap engineering is achieved by controlling the bond angles through the\nsteric size of the molecular cation.

The presence of a band gap also gives rise to current saturation, allowing\npower and voltage gain, all in the gigahertz range. This shows that MoS2 could\nbe an interesting material for realizing high-speed amplifiers and logic\ncircuits with device scaling expected to result in further improvement of\nperformance. Our work represents the first step in the realization of\nhigh-frequency analog and digital circuits based on two-dimensional\nsemiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 11:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-24"}

This metric bracket generates dissipative\nforces.\n  The metriplectic algebra includes the conserved total Hamiltonian $H$,\ngenerating the non-dissipative part of dynamics, and the entropy $S$ of those\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom draining energy irreversibly, that generates\ndissipation. This $S$ is a Casimir of the Poisson algebra to which the\nmetriplectic algebra reduces in the frictionless limit.\n  In the present paper, the metriplectic framework for viscous fluids is\nre-written in the Lagrangian Formulation, where the system is described through\nmaterial variables: this is a way to describe the continuum much closer to the\ndiscrete system dynamics than the Eulerian fields. Accordingly, the full\nmetriplectic algebra is constructed in material variables, and this will render\nit possible to apply it in all those cases in which the Lagrangian Formulation\nis preferred.\n  The role of the entropy $S$ of a metriplectic system is as paramount as that\nof the Hamiltonian $H$, but this fact may be underestimated in the Eulerian\nformulation because $S$ is not the only Casimir of the symplectic non-canonical\npart of the algebra. Instead, when the dynamics of the non-ideal fluid is\nwritten through the parcel variables of the Lagrangian formulation, the fact\nthat entropy is symplectically invariant appears to be more clearly related to\nits dependence on the microscopic degrees of freedom of the fluid, that do not\nparticipate at all to the symplectic canonical part of the algebra (which,\nindeed, involves and evolves only the macroscopic degrees of freedom of the\nfluid parcel).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 14:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Methods: All available XMM-Newton data\n(exposure times of 420 ks EPIC-pn, 556 ks EPIC-MOS1, 614 ks EPIC-MOS2) were\nused to characterise the thermal X-ray emission in the region. An analysis of\nthe non-thermal X-rays is also presented and discussed in the context of\nemission mechanisms previously suggested in the literature.

Results: The brightest thermal emission was found to\nbe associated with a new supernova remnant, MCSNR J0536-6913. X-ray spectral\nanalysis of MCSNR J0536-6913 suggested an ejecta-dominated remnant with lines\nof O, Ne, Mg, and Si, and a total 0.3-10 keV luminosity of ~8E+34 erg/s.

The thermal emission from the SB exhibited enrichment by alpha-process\nelements, evidence for a recent core-collapse SNR interaction with the SB\nshell. We detected non-thermal X-ray emission throughout 30 Dor C, with the\nbrightest regions being highly correlated with the H-alpha and radio shells.

Furthermore, based on the scalable\nnumber of the most suitable local representatives, the global clustering can be\ndone very effectively and efficiently.

In the framework of tight-binding simulation and perturbation theory,\nwe show that the energy splitting of the topological qubits in a finite length\nnanowire is still robust against local perturbations, which is ensured not only\nby topology, but also by the particle-hole symmetry.

The recently\ndiscovered pressure-induced superconductor CrAs, as a rare example of a\nnon-collinear helimagnetic superconductor, has therefore generated great\ninterest in understanding microscopic magnetic properties and their interplay\nwith superconductivity [6-8]. Unlike cuprates and iron based superconductors\nwhere the magnetic moment direction barely changes upon doping, here we show\nthat CrAs exhibits a spin reorientation from the ab plane to the ac plane,\nalong with an abrupt drop of the magnetic propagation vector at a critical\npressure (Pc~0.6 GPa). This magnetic phase transition coincides with the\nemergence of bulk superconductivity, indicating a direct connection between\nmagnetism and superconductivity. With further increasing pressure, the magnetic\norder completely disappears near the optimal Tc regime (P~0.94 GPa). Moreover,\nthe Cr magnetic moments between nearest neighbors tend to be aligned\nantiparallel with increasing pressure toward the optimal superconductivity\nregime.

It is powerful to estimate the\nmagnetostriction coefficient of ferromagnetic thin films and can be used to\ndetermine the effective magnetoelectric coefficient of the whole\nheterostructures in addition to the piezoelectric coefficient related to the\nin-plane voltage-induced strains. This methodology can be applied to system for\nwhich the strains are well transmitted at the different interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 15:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-26"}
