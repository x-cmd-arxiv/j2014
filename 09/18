This\nis obtained by dimensional reduction of a five dimension massive two form, or\nKalb-Ramond field, giving a Kalb-Ramond and an emergent vector field in four\ndimensions. A geometrical coupling with the Ricci scalar is proposed and the\ncoupling constant is fixed such that the components of the fields are\nlocalized. The solution is obtained by decomposing the fields in transversal\nand longitudinal parts and showing that this give decoupled equations of motion\nfor the transverse vector and KR fields in four dimensions. We also prove some\nidentities satisfied by the transverse components of the fields. With this is\npossible to fix the coupling constant in a way that a localized zero mode for\nboth components on the brane is obtained. Then, all the above results are\ngeneralized to the massive $p-$form field. It is also shown that in general an\neffective $p$ and $(p-1)-$forms can not be localized on the brane and we have\nto sort one of them to localize. Therefore, we can not have a vector and a\nscalar field localized by dimensional reduction of the five dimensional vector\nfield. In fact we find the expression $p=(d-1)/2$ which determines what forms\nwill give rise to both fields localized. For $D=5$, as expected, this is valid\nonly for the KR field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 16:02:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Dec 2014 19:13:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

As used to describe experiments, both\ndensity operators and detection operators depend on parameters expressing\nexperimental choices, so the probabilities they generate also depend on these\nparameters. The trace rule answers the question: \"what parametrized\nprobabilities are generated by a given parametrized density operator and given\nparametrized detection operator?\"\n  Recognizing that the accessibility of operators to experimental tests is only\nindirect, via probabilities, we ask what probabilities tell about operators,\nor, put more precisely: \"what combinations of a parametrized density operator\nand parametrized detection operators generate any given set of parametrized\nprobabilities?\"\n  We show that any parametrized probability measure can be explained by many\ninequivalent models expressed by density operators and detection operators. so\nthat a parametrized probability measure, detached from any of the (infinitely\nmany) parametrized operators that generate it, becomes an interesting object in\nits own right.

Here we present a suite of\nthree-dimensional atmospheric circulation models for HAT-P-2b that investigate\nthe effects of assumed atmospheric composition and rotation rate on global\nscale winds and thermal patterns. We compare and contrast atmospheric models\nfor HAT-P-2b, which assume one and five times solar metallicity, both with and\nwithout TiO/VO as atmospheric constituents. Additionally we compare models that\nassume a rotation period of half, one, and two times the nominal\npseudo-synchronous rotation period. We find that changes in assumed atmospheric\nmetallicity and rotation rate do not significantly affect model predictions of\nthe planetary flux as a function of orbital phase. However, models in which\nTiO/VO are present in the atmosphere develop a transient temperature inversion\nbetween the transit and secondary eclipse events that results in significant\nvariations in the timing and magnitude of the peak of the planetary flux\ncompared with models in which TiO/VO are omitted from the opacity tables. We\nfind that no one single atmospheric model can reproduce the recently observed\nfull orbit phase curves at 3.6, 4.5 and 8.0 microns, which is likely due to a\nchemical process not captured by our current atmospheric models for HAT-P-2b.\nFurther modeling and observational efforts focused on understanding the\nchemistry of HAT-P-2b's atmosphere are needed and could provide key insights\ninto the interplay between radiative, dynamical, and chemical processes in a\nwide range of exoplanet atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 19:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Brook's\nTheorem states that every graph with maximum degree k is k-colorable unless it\ncontains a subgraph isomorphic to K_{k+1} (or an odd cycle for k=2).\nEquivalently, for all k>=4, the only k-critical graph of maximum degree k-1 is\nK_k. A natural generalization of Brook's theorem is to consider the Ore-degree\nof a graph, which is the maximum of d(u)+d(v) over all edges uv. Kierstead and\nKostochka proved that for all k>=6 the only k-critical graph with Ore-degree at\nmost 2k-1 is K_k. Kostochka, Rabern and Steibitz proved that the only\n5-critical graphs with Ore-degree at most 9 are K_5 and a graph they called\nO_5.\n  A different generalization of Brook's theorem, motivated by Hajos'\nconstruction, is Gallai's conjectured bound on the minimum density of a\nk-critical graph. Recently, Kostochka and Yancey proved Gallai's conjecture.\nTheir proof for k>=5 implies the above results on Ore-degree. However, the case\nfor k=4 remains open, which is the subject of this paper.\n  Kostochka and Yancey's short but beautiful proof for the case k=4 says that\nif $G$ is a $4$-critical graph, then |E(G)|>= (5|V(G)|-2)/3. We prove the\nfollowing bound which is better when there exists a large independent set of\ndegree three vertices: if G is a 4-critical graph G, then |E(G)|>= 1.6 |V(G)| +\n.2 alpha(D_3(G)) - .6, where D_3(G) is the graph induced by the degree three\nvertices of G. As a corollary, we characterize the 4-critical graphs with\nOre-degree at most seven as precisely the graphs of Ore-degree seven in the\nfamily of graphs obtained from K_4 and Ore compositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 19:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-18"}

Two formation scenarios were suggested for their\norigin: (1) Build-up of NSCs from consecutive infall of stellar cluster and (2)\nContinuous in-situ star-formation. Though the cluster-infall scenario has been\nextensively studied in recent years, the in-situ formation scenario have been\nhardly explored. Here we use Fokker-Planck (FP) calculations to study the\neffects of star formation on the build-up of NSCs and its implications for\ntheir long term evolution and their resulting structure. We use the FP equation\nto describe the evolution of several stellar populations, and add appropriate\nsource terms to account for the effects of newly formed stars.

However, its younger stellar population do not\nyet achieve a steady state. In particular, formed/evolved NSCs with in-situ\nstar-formation contain differential age-segregated stellar populations which\nare not yet fully mixed. Younger stellar populations formed in the outer\nregions of the NSC have a cuspy structure towards the NSC outskirts, while\nshowing a core-like distribution inwards; with younger populations having\nlarger core sizes. In principal, such a structure can give rise to an apparent\ncore-like radial distribution of younger (up to 2-3 Gyrs) stars, as observed in\nthe Galactic center.

We simulate\nsurface brightness profiles of these S0-like remnants in the K-band, mimicking\ntypical observational conditions, to perform bulge-disc decompositions\nanalogous to those carried out in real S0s. The global bulge-disc structure of\nthese remnants has been compared with real data, and they distribute in the B/T\n- r_e - h_d parameter space consistently with real bright S0s, where B/T is the\nbulge-to-total luminosity ratio, r_e is the bulge effective radius, and h_d is\nthe disc scalelength. Major mergers can rebuild a bulge-disc coupling in the\nremnants after having destroyed the structures of the progenitors, whereas\nminor mergers directly preserve them. Remnants exhibit B/T and r_e/h_d spanning\na wide range of values, and their distribution is consistent with observations.\nMany remnants have bulge Sersic indices ranging 1<n<2, flat appearance, and\ncontain residual star formation in embedded discs, a result which agrees with\nthe presence of pseudobulges in real S0s. Contrary to the popular view, mergers\n(and in particular, major events) can result in S0 remnants with realistically\ncoupled bulge-disc structures in less than ~3 Gyr. In conclusion, the\nbulge-disc coupling and the presence of pseudobulges in real S0s cannot be used\nas an argument against the possible major-merger origin of these galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 20:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 2014 22:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

However\nat low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), LP decoding is observed to have worse\nerror performance than belief propagation (BP) decoding. In this paper, we seek\nto improve LP decoding at low SNRs while still achieving good high SNR\nperformance. We first present a new decoding framework obtained by trying to\nsolve a non-convex optimization problem using the alternating direction method\nof multipliers (ADMM). This non-convex problem is constructed by adding a\npenalty term to the LP decoding objective. The goal of the penalty term is to\nmake \"pseudocodewords\", which are the non-integer vertices of the LP relaxation\nto which the LP decoder fails, more costly. We name this decoder class the\n\"ADMM penalized decoder\". In our simulation results, the ADMM penalized decoder\nwith $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ penalties outperforms both BP and LP decoding at all\nSNRs. For high SNR regimes where it is infeasible to simulate, we use an\ninstanton analysis and show that the ADMM penalized decoder has better high SNR\nperformance than BP decoding. We also develop a reweighted LP decoder using\nlinear approximations to the objective with an $\\ell_1$ penalty. We show that\nthis decoder has an improved theoretical recovery threshold compared to LP\ndecoding. In addition, we show that the empirical gain of the reweighted LP\ndecoder is significant at low SNRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 20:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

We apply ADMM to two decoding problems. The first problem is linear\nprogramming (LP) decoding. In order to develop an efficient algorithm, we focus\non non-binary codes in fields of characteristic two. This allows us to\ntransform each constraint in $\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ to a set of constraints in\n$\\mathbb{F}_{2}$ that has a factor graph representation. Applying ADMM to the\nLP decoding problem results in two types of non-trivial sub-routines. The first\ntype requires us to solve an unconstrained quadratic program. We solve this\nproblem efficiently by leveraging new results obtained from studying the above\nfactor graphs. The second type requires Euclidean projection onto polytopes\nthat are studied in the literature, a projection that can be solved efficiently\nusing off-the-shelf techniques, which scale linearly in the dimension of the\nvector to project. ADMM LP decoding scales linearly with block length, linearly\nwith check degree, and quadratically with field size. The second problem we\nconsider is a penalized LP decoding problem. This problem is obtained by\nincorporating a penalty term into the LP decoding objective. The purpose of the\npenalty term is to make non-integer solutions (pseudocodewords) more expensive\nand hence to improve decoding performance. The ADMM algorithm for the penalized\nLP problem requires Euclidean projection onto a polytope formed by embedding\nthe constraints specified by the non-binary single parity-check code, which can\nbe solved by applying the ADMM technique to the resulting quadratic program.\nEmpirically, this decoder achieves a much reduced error rate than LP decoding\nat low signal-to-noise ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 20:40:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 03:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

In the MPISP, each inspector is scheduled to perform a route\nin a given multi-period planning horizon. At the end of each period, each\ninspector is not required to return to the depot but has to stay at one of the\nvertices for recuperation. If the remaining time of the current period is\ninsufficient for an inspector to travel from his/her current vertex $A$ to a\ncertain vertex B, he/she can choose either waiting at vertex A until the start\nof the next period or traveling to a vertex C that is closer to vertex B.\nTherefore, the shortest transit time between any vertex pair is affected by the\nlength of the period and the departure time. We first describe an approach of\ncomputing the shortest transit time between any pair of vertices with an\narbitrary departure time. To solve the MPISP, we then propose several local\nsearch operators adapted from classical operators for the VRPTW and integrate\nthem into a tabu search framework. In addition, we present a constrained\nknapsack model that is able to produce an upper bound for the problem. Finally,\nwe evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm with extensive experiments based\non a set of test instances. Our computational results indicate that our\napproach generates high-quality solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 23:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-19"}

Various algorithms\nof kernel Bayesian inference have been developed by combining kernelized basic\nprobabilistic operations such as the kernel sum rule and kernel Bayes' rule.\nHowever, the current framework is fully nonparametric, and it does not allow a\nuser to flexibly combine nonparametric and model-based inferences. This is\ninefficient when there are good probabilistic models (or simulation models)\navailable for some parts of a graphical model; this is in particular true in\nscientific fields where \"models\" are the central topic of study. Our\ncontribution in this paper is to introduce a novel approach, termed the {\\em\nmodel-based kernel sum rule} (Mb-KSR), to combine a probabilistic model and\nkernel Bayesian inference. By combining the Mb-KSR with the existing kernelized\nprobabilistic rules, one can develop various algorithms for hybrid (i.e.,\nnonparametric and model-based) inferences. As an illustrative example, we\nconsider Bayesian filtering in a state space model, where typically there\nexists an accurate probabilistic model for the state transition process.

Importantly, the\nscreening of the MoS2 substrate can be tuned by changing the position of the\nFermi energy with relatively low gate voltages.

The system relaxes relatively slowly (time-constant ~ 45\nminutes) which is attributed to the flow properties of the LC layers embedded\nin the elastomer network. At high strains, the equilibration time (~ 4 - 8\nminutes) conforms to a faster relaxation and appears to have its origin in the\npolymer components of the system. Due to misaligned microdomains at small\nstrains, the value of global orientational order parameter S for the mesogenic\nparts is initially small (~ 0.15). With increasing strain, the local\ndomain-directors, the mesogens, and the polymer chains, all tend to align\nparallel to the stretch direction giving rise to a higher measured value of S ~\n0.83 at a strain of 4.0.

It consists in combining the method of\nmultipliers with an infeasible active-set method. Our approach is iterative. In\neach step we calculate an augmented Lagrange function. Then we minimize this\nfunction using an infeasible active-set method that was already successfully\napplied to similar problems. After this we update the Lagrange multiplier for\nthe equality constraints. Finally we try to solve convex quadratic program\ndirectly, again with the infeasible active-set method, starting from the\noptimal solution of the actual Lagrange function. Computational experience with\nour method indicates that typically only few (most of the time only one) outer\niterations (multiplier-updates) and also only few (most of the time less than\nten) inner iterations (minimization of the Lagrange function) are required to\nreach the optimal solution.\n  The diploma thesis is organized as follows. We close this chapter with some\nnota- tion used throughout. In Chapter 2 we show the equivalence of different\nQP problem formulations and present some important so-called direct methods for\nsolving equality-constrained QPs. We cover the most important aspects for\npractically successful interior point methods for linear and convex quadratic\nprogramming in Chapter 3.

To this end, Horner's method\ncan be used. Finding suitable Horner schemes is assumed to be hard, due to the\nlack of local heuristics. Recently, MCTS was reported to be able to find near\noptimal schemes. However, several parameters had to be fine-tuned manually. In\nthis work, we investigate the state space properties of Horner schemes and find\nthat the domain is relatively flat and contains only a few local minima. As a\nresult, the Horner space is appropriate to be explored by Stochastic Local\nSearch (SLS), which has only two parameters: the number of iterations\n(computation time) and the neighborhood structure. We found a suitable\nneighborhood structure, leaving only the allowed computation time as a\nparameter. We performed a range of experiments. The results obtained by SLS are\nsimilar or better than those obtained by MCTS. Furthermore, we show that SLS\nobtains the good results at least 10 times faster. Using SLS, we can speed up\nnumerical integration of many real-world large expressions by at least a factor\nof 24. For High Energy Physics this means that numerical integrations that took\nweeks can now be done in hours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-19"}

Light curves were Fourier-decomposed and\ncoefficients from WASP were transformed to the ASAS standard using 24 common\nstars. Coefficients were then compared with similar data from Galactic globular\nclusters, the Galactic bulge and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and\nSMC). Using Fourier coefficients, we also calculated physical parameters via\nstandard equations from the literature. We confirmed the results of previous\nauthors, including lower amplitudes and longer rise times for Blazhko stars. It\nwas found that in the $R_{31}$ vs. $R_{21}$ plot the location of a star depends\nmainly on its metallicity and that Blazhko stars prefer a different location\nthan modulation-free stars. Field and globular-cluster RR Lyrae variables have\na different $\\phi_{21}$ and $\\phi_{31}$ than stars in the LMC, SMC and in\nGalactic bulge. Although there are some weak indications that Blazhko stars\ncould prefer a slightly lower metallicity and shorter periods, no convincing\nproof was found. The most interesting highlight is the identification of a very\nrecently proposed new group of metal-rich RR Lyrae type stars. These\nlow-luminous, metal-strong variables, which comprise both Blazhko and regular\nstars, have shorter periods and about a 180 K higher temperature at constant\n$(B-V)_{0}$ than the rest of the stars in the sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 09:19:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 05:43:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 13:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

In the simplest case, such dependencies are measured via\ncorrelation-based metrics: we show that this is equivalent to the use of\ncompletely homogeneous benchmarks specifying only global constraints, such as\nthe total number of links in each layer. However, these approaches do not take\ninto account the heterogeneity in the degree and strength distributions, which\nare instead a fundamental feature of real-world multiplexes. In this work, we\ncompare the observed dependencies between layers with the expected values\nobtained from reference models that appropriately control for the observed\nheterogeneity in the degree and strength distributions. This leads to novel\nmultiplexity measures that we test on different datasets, i.e. the\nInternational Trade Network (ITN) and the European Airport Network (EAN). Our\nfindings confirm that the use of homogeneous benchmarks can lead to misleading\nresults, and furthermore highlight the important role played by the\ndistribution of hubs across layers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 10:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-31"}

It is based on a protocol\nheader inserted between the Network and Transport layers, therefore it can be\nseen as a layer 3.5 solution. Technically, GVN is proposed as a new transport\nlayer protocol in the TCP/IP protocol suite. An IP router that is not GVN\ncapable will simply process the IP destination address as usual. Similar\nconcepts have been proposed in other works, and referred to as Service Oriented\nNetworking, Service Centric Networking, Application Delivery Networking, but\nthey are now generalized in the proposed GVN framework. In this respect, the\nGVN header is a generic container that can be adapted to serve the needs of\narbitrary service level routing solutions. The GVN header can be managed by GVN\ncapable end-hosts and applications or can be pushed/popped at the edge of a GVN\ncapable network (like a VLAN tag). In this position paper, we show that\nGeneralized Virtual Networking is a powerful enabler for SCN (Service Centric\nNetworking) and NFV (Network Function Virtualization) and how it couples with\nthe SDN (Software Defined Networking) paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 11:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-19"}

Such families of parametric polyhedra appear in\nmany areas of combinatorics, convex geometry, algebra and number theory. The\nkey themes of this paper are: (1) A structure theory that characterizes\nprecisely the subset $\\mbox{ Sg}_{\\geq k}(A)$ of all vectors $b \\in \\mbox{\nSg}(A)$ such that $P_A(b) \\cap {\\mathbb Z}^n $ has at least $k$ solutions.

Related results can be derived for those right-hand-side vectors\n$b$ for which $P_A(b) \\cap {\\mathbb Z}^n$ has exactly $k$ solutions or fewer\nthan $k$ solutions. (2) A computational complexity theory. We show that, when\n$n$, $k$ are fixed natural numbers, one can compute in polynomial time an\nencoding of $\\mbox{ Sg}_{\\geq k}(A)$ as a multivariate generating function,\nusing a short sum of rational functions. As a consequence, one can identify all\nright-hand-side vectors of bounded norm that have at least $k$ solutions. (3)\nApplications and computation for the $k$-Frobenius numbers. Using Generating\nfunctions we prove that for fixed $n,k$ the $k$-Frobenius number can be\ncomputed in polynomial time. This generalizes a well-known result for $k=1$ by\nR. Kannan. Using some adaptation of dynamic programming we show some practical\ncomputations of $k$-Frobenius numbers and their relatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 11:09:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2015 13:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-27"}

In this paper, we present an\nanalysis of 32 GRB X-ray flares that are simultaneously observed by both BAT\nand XRT on board the Swift mission, so a joint spectral analysis with a wider\nspectral coverage is possible. Our results show that the joint spectra of 19\nflares are fitted with the absorbed single power-law or the Band function\nmodels. More interestingly, the joint spectra of the other 13 X-ray flares are\nfitted with the absorbed single power-law model plus a black body (BB)\ncomponent. Phenomenally, the observed spectra of these 13 flares are analogous\nto several GRBs with a thermal component, but only with a much lower\ntemperature of $kT=1\\sim 3$ keV. Assuming that the thermal emission is the\nphotosphere emission of the GRB fireball, we derive the fireball properties of\nthe 13 flares that have redshift measurements, such as the bulk Lorentz factor\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm ph}$ of the outflow. The derived $\\Gamma_{\\rm ph}$ range from $50$\nto $150$ and a relation of $\\Gamma_{\\rm ph}$ to the thermal emission luminosity\nis found.

An alternative strategy could be to study deviations of network\narchitectures from regular graphs (rings, lattices) and consider the\nimplications of such deviations for self-organized dynamic patterns on the\nnetwork.

The degree of a node in a network is the number of\nconnections it has to other nodes and the degree distribution is the\nprobability distribution of these degrees over the whole network. Therefore,\nthe degree is very important structural parameter of network topology. However,\ngiven the number of nodes and the degree of each node in a network, the\ntopology of the network cannot be determined. Therefore, we propose the\ndegree-layer theory of network topology to describe deeply the network\ntopology. First, we propose the concept of degree-tree with the breadth-first\nsearch tree. The degrees of all nodes are layered and have a hierarchical\nstructure. Second,the degree-layer theory is described in detail. Two new\nconcepts are defined in the theory.

It is known, however, that the expression of gap\njunctions increases dramatically in the approach to parturition, which results\nin a significant increase in inter-cellular electrical coupling. In this paper,\nwe build upon previous studies of the activity of electrically excitable smooth\nmuscle cells (myocytes) and investigate the mechanism through which the\ncoupling of these cells to electrically passive cells results in the generation\nof spontaneous activity in the uterus. Using a recently developed, realistic\nmodel of uterine muscle cell dynamics, we investigate a system consisting of a\nmyocyte coupled to passive cells. We then extend our analysis to a simple\ntwo-dimensional lattice model of the tissue, with each myocyte being coupled to\nits neighbors, as well as to a random number of passive cells. We observe that\ndifferent dynamical regimes can be observed over a range of gap junction\nconductances: at low coupling strength, the activity is confined to cell\nclusters, while the activity for high coupling may spread across the entire\ntissue. Additionally, we find that the system supports the spontaneous\ngeneration of spiral wave activity. Our results are both qualitatively and\nquantitatively consistent with observations from in vitro experiments.

The path constraint for player 1 could be qualitative, i.e., the\nmean-payoff is the maximal reward, or arbitrarily close to it; or quantitative,\ni.e., a given threshold between the minimal and maximal reward. We consider the\ncomputation of the almost-sure (resp. positive) winning sets, where player 1\ncan ensure that the path constraint is satisfied with probability 1 (resp.\npositive probability). Our main results for qualitative path constraints are as\nfollows: (1) we establish qualitative determinacy results that show that for\nevery state either player 1 has a strategy to ensure almost-sure (resp.\npositive) winning against all player-2 strategies, or player 2 has a spoiling\nstrategy to falsify almost-sure (resp. positive) winning against all player-1\nstrategies; (2) we present optimal strategy complexity results that precisely\ncharacterize the classes of strategies required for almost-sure and positive\nwinning for both players; and (3) we present quadratic time algorithms to\ncompute the almost-sure and the positive winning sets, matching the best known\nbound of algorithms for much simpler problems (such as reachability\nobjectives).

Hence, many\nimplementations rely on repeated incremental validation of every read of the\ntransaction to always guarantee for a consistent view of shared data. Because\nthis eager validation technique generates significant processing costs several\nproposals have been published to establish a sandbox for transactions, which\ntransparently prevents or suppresses those errors and thereby allows to reduce\nthe frequency of in-flight validations.\n  The most comprehensive sandboxing concept of transactions in software\ntransactional memory based on deferred updates and considering unmanaged\nlanguages, integrates multiple techniques such as signal interposition,\nout-of-band validation and static and dynamic instrumentation. The latter\ncomprises the insertion of a validation barrier in front of every direct write\nwhich addresses the execution stack of the thread and potentially results from\nunvalidated reads.\n  This paper basically results from a review of this sandboxing approach, which\nrevealed some improvements for sandboxing on C/C++. Based on knowledge about\nthe runtime environment and the compiler an error model has been developed to\nidentify critical paths to application visible errors. This analysis lead to a\nconcept for stack protection with less frequent validation, an alternative\nout-of-band validation technique and revealed additional risks of so-called\nwaivered regions without instrumentation inside transactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 14:26:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 17:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-23"}

We wish to connect string-scale\nphysics as closely as possible to observables accessible to current or\nnear-future experiments. Our possible best hope to do so is a description of\ninflation in string theory. The energy scale of inflation can be as high as\nthat of Grand Unification (GUT). If this is the case, this is the closest we\ncan possibly get in energy scales to string-scale physics. Hence, GUT-scale\ninflation may be our best candidate phenomenon to preserve traces of\nstring-scale dynamics. Our chance to look for such traces is the primordial\ngravitational wave, or tensor mode signal produced during inflation. For\nGUT-scale inflation this is strong enough to be potentially visible as a B-mode\npolarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Moreover, a GUT-scale\ninflation model has a trans-Planckian excursion of the inflaton scalar field\nduring the observable amount of inflation. Such large-field models of inflation\nhave a clear need for symmetry protection against quantum corrections. This\nmakes them ideal candidates for a description in a candidate fundamental theory\nlike string theory. At the same time the need of large-field inflation models\nfor UV completion makes them particularly susceptible to preserve imprints of\ntheir string-scale dynamics in the inflationary observables, the spectral index\n$n_s$ and the fractional tensor mode power $r$.

Independent mean-field evolutions are performed with each set of\ninitial values followed by averaging over the resulting ensemble. This approach\nhas been recently shown to be rather versatile and accurate in describing the\ncorrelated dynamics beyond the independent particle picture. In the original\nformulation of SMF, it was proposed to use a Gaussian assumption for the\nphase-space distribution. This assumption turns out to be rather effective when\nthe dynamics of an initially uncorrelated state is considered, which was the\ncase in all applications of this approach up to now. Using the\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, we show that such an assumption might not be\nadequate if the quantum system under interest is initially correlated and\npresents configuration mixing between several Slater determinants. In this\ncase, a more realistic description of the initial phase-space is necessary. We\nshow that the SMF approach can be advantageously combined with standard methods\nto describe phase-space in quantum mechanics. As an illustration, the Husimi\ndistribution function is used here to obtain a realistic representation of the\nphase-space of a quantum many-body system. This method greatly improves the\ndescription of initially correlated fermionic many-body states. In the LMG\nmodel, while the Gaussian approximation failed to describe these systems in all\ninteraction strength range, the novel approach gives a perfect agreement with\nthe exact evolution in the weak coupling regime and significantly improves the\ndescription of correlated systems in the strong coupling regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 13:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}
