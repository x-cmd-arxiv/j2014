Most graphene devices are\nfabricated on doped Si substrates with SiO2 dielectric used for back gating.\nHere, we demonstrate photodetection in graphene field effect phototransistors\nfabricated on undoped semiconductor (SiC) substrates.

How\ncan we search for water and oxygen in those nontransiting planets? We show that\na combination of high-dispersion spectroscopic and coronagraphic techniques is\na promising technique to detect molecular lines imprinted in the scattered\nlight of Earth-like planets (ELPs). In this method, the planetary signals are\nspectroscopically separated from telluric absorption by using the Doppler\nshift. Assuming a long observing campaign (a 10-day exposure) using a\nhigh-dispersion spectrometer (R=50,000) with speckle suppression on a 30-m\ntelescope, we simulate the spectra from ELPs around M dwarfs (whose stellar\neffective temperature is 2750-3750 K) at 5 pc. Performing a cross-correlation\nanalysis with the spectral template of the molecular lines, we find that raw\ncontrasts of $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-5}$ (using Y, J, and H bands) are required to\ndetect water vapor at the 3 $\\sigma$ and 16 $\\sigma$ levels, respectively, for\n$T_\\star$=3000 K. The raw contrast of $10^{-5}$ is required for a 6 $\\sigma$\ndetection of the oxygen 1.27 $\\mu$m band. We also examine possible systematics,\nincomplete speckle subtraction, and the correction for telluric lines. When\nthose are not perfect, a telluric water signal appears in the cross-correlation\nfunction. However, we find the planetary signal is separated from that\nresulting from the velocity difference. We also find that the intrinsic water\nlines in the Phoenix spectra are too weak to affect the results for water\ndetection.

Our\nintuitive, two-phases cross-correlation based scheme relies on a switched beam\nantenna array, which is used to collect an omni-directional signal using few\nelements of the antenna array in the first phase. In the second phase, the\nscheme switches the main beam of the antenna array to scan the angular region\nof interest. The collected signal from each beam (direction or angle) is cross\ncorrelated with the omni-directional signal. The cross-correlation coefficient\nwill be the highest at the correct AoA and relatively negligible elsewhere. The\nproposed scheme simplicity stems from its low computational complexity (only\ncross-correlation and comparison operations are required) and its independence\nof the transmitted signal structure (does not require information about the\ntransmitted signal). The proposed scheme requires a receiver with switched beam\nantenna array, which can be attached to a single radio frequency chain through\nphase shifters, hence, its hardware friendliness. The high efficiency of our\nsystem can be observed by comparing its performance with the literature's best\nperforming MUSIC algorithm. The comparison demonstrates that our scheme\noutperforms the MUSIC algorithm, specially at low SNR levels. Moreover, the\nnumber of sources that can be detected using our scheme is bound by the number\nof switched beams, rather than the number of antenna elements in the case of\nthe MUSIC algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 18:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-22"}

We show\nthat if the dispersion measures resulted from propagation through the\nintergalactic medium at cosmological distances and the pulse widths were a\nconsequence of scattering by single thin screens, then the screens' electron\ndensities were $\\gtrsim 20$/cm$^3$, $10^8$ times the mean intergalactic\ndensity. This problem is resolved if the radiation scattered close to its\nsource, where high densities are possible. Observation of dispersion indices\nclose to their low density limit of $-2$ sets a model-independent upper bound\non the electron density and a lower bound on the size of the dispersive plasma\ncloud, excluding terrestrial or Solar System origin. The scattering and much of\nthe dispersion measures may be attributed to scattering regions about 1 AU from\nthe sources, with electron densities $\\sim 3 \\times 10^8$/cm$^3$.

Traditional inclusive measurements on\nnuclear targets are limited by dilution from scattering on protons, Fermi\nmotion and binding effects, final-state interactions, and nuclear shadowing at\nx << 0.1. An Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) would enable next-generation\nmeasurements of neutron structure with polarized deuteron beams and detection\nof forward-moving spectator protons over a wide range of recoil momenta (0 <\np_R < several 100 MeV in the nucleus rest frame). The free neutron structure\nfunctions could be obtained by extrapolating the measured recoil momentum\ndistributions to the on-shell point. The method eliminates nuclear\nmodifications and can be applied to polarized scattering, as well as to\nsemi-inclusive and exclusive final states. We review the prospects for neutron\nstructure measurements with spectator tagging at EIC, the status of R&D\nefforts, and the accelerator and detector requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 19:16:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-03"}

Measuring star formation across the Universe is key to constrain\nmodels of galaxy formation and evolution. Yet, determining the SFR (star\nformation rate) of galaxies remains a challenge. Aims. In this paper we\ninvestigate in isolation the impact of a variable star formation history on the\nmeasurement of the SFR. Methods. We combine 23 state-of-the-art hydrodynamical\nsimulations of 1<z<2 galaxies on the main sequence with the cigale spectral\nenergy distribution modelling code. This allows us to generate synthetic\nspectra every 1 Myr for each simulation, taking the stellar populations and the\nnebular emission into account. Using these spectra, we estimate the SFR from\nclassical estimators which we compare with the true SFR we know from the\nsimulations. Results. We find that except for the Lyman continuum, classical\nSFR estimators calibrated over 100 Myr overestimate the SFR from ~25% in the\nFUV band to ~65% in the U band. Such biases are due 1) to the contribution of\nstars living longer than 100 Myr, and 2) to variations of the SFR on timescales\nlonger than a few tens of Myr. Rapid variations of the SFR increase the\nuncertainty on the determination of the instantaneous SFR but have no long term\neffect. Conclusions.

We also analyze four previously-known\nr-process-enhanced metal-poor red giants. From this sample of 13 stars, we draw\nthe following conclusions. (1) High levels of r-process enhancement are found\nin a broad range of stellar evolutionary states, reaffirming that this\nphenomenon is not associated with a chemical peculiarity of red giant\natmospheres. (2) Only 1 of 10 stars observed at multiple epochs shows radial\nvelocity variations, reaffirming that stars with high levels of r-process\nenhancement are not preferentially found among binaries. (3) Only 2 of the 13\nstars are highly-enhanced in C and N, indicating that there is no connection\nbetween high levels of r-process enhancement and high levels of C and N. (4)\nThe dispersions in [Sr/Ba] and [Sr/Eu] are larger than the dispersions in\n[Ba/Eu] and [Yb/Eu], suggesting that the elements below the second r-process\npeak do not always scale with those in the rare earth domain, even within the\nclass of highly-r-process-enhanced stars. (5) The light-element (12<Z<30)\nabundances of highly-r-process-enhanced stars are indistinguishable from those\nwith normal levels of r-process material at the limit of our data, 3.5 per cent\n(0.015 dex) on average. The nucleosynthetic sites responsible for the large\nr-process enhancements did not produce any detectable light-element abundance\nsignatures distinct from normal core-collapse supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 20:32:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This is typically done by maximizing a score\nfunction on the space of labels, which decomposes as a sum of pairwise\nelements, each depending on two specific labels. Intuitively, the more pairwise\nterms are used, the better the expected accuracy. However, there is currently\nno theoretical account of this intuition. This paper takes a significant step\nin this direction.\n  We formulate the problem as classifying the vertices of a known graph\n$G=(V,E)$, where the vertices and edges of the graph are labelled and correlate\nsemi-randomly with the ground truth. We show that the prospects for achieving\nlow expected Hamming error depend on the structure of the graph $G$ in\ninteresting ways. For example, if $G$ is a very poor expander, like a path,\nthen large expected Hamming error is inevitable. Our main positive result shows\nthat, for a wide class of graphs including 2D grid graphs common in machine\nvision applications, there is a polynomial-time algorithm with small and\ninformation-theoretically near-optimal expected error. Our results provide a\nfirst step toward a theoretical justification for the empirical success of the\nefficient approximate inference algorithms that are used for structured\nprediction in models where exact inference is intractable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 23:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-23"}

Perfect state transfer occurs\nbetween vertices $u$ and $v$ at time $\\tau$ if the $(u,v)$-entry of $U(\\tau)$\nhas unit magnitude. This paper studies quantum walks relative to graph\nLaplacians. Some main observations include the following closure properties for\nperfect state transfer:\n  (1) If a $n$-vertex graph has perfect state transfer at time $\\tau$ relative\nto the Laplacian, then so does its complement if $n\\tau$ is an integer multiple\nof $2\\pi$. As a corollary, the double cone over any $m$-vertex graph has\nperfect state transfer relative to the Laplacian if and only if $m \\equiv 2\n\\pmod{4}$. This was previously known for a double cone over a clique (S. Bose,\nA. Casaccino, S. Mancini, S. Severini, Int. J. Quant. Inf., 7:11, 2009).\n  (2) If a graph $G$ has perfect state transfer at time $\\tau$ relative to the\nnormalized Laplacian, then so does the weak product $G \\times H$ if for any\nnormalized Laplacian eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $G$ and $\\mu$ of $H$, we have\n$\\mu(\\lambda-1)\\tau$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. As a corollary, a weak\nproduct of $P_{3}$ with an even clique or an odd cube has perfect state\ntransfer relative to the normalized Laplacian. It was known earlier that a weak\nproduct of a circulant with odd integer eigenvalues and an even cube or a\nCartesian power of $P_{3}$ has perfect state transfer relative to the adjacency\nmatrix.\n  As for negative results, no path with four vertices or more has antipodal\nperfect state transfer relative to the normalized Laplacian. This almost\nmatches the state of affairs under the adjacency matrix (C. Godsil, Discrete\nMath., 312:1, 2011).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Sep 2014 01:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

To identify the ground\nstate, we take four kinds of clusters into account; periodic, cylindrical, and\ntwo open ones. The hexagonal singlet solid (HSS) and triangular valence bond\nsolid (TVBS) states are artificially generated by modulating edge shapes of the\nopen clusters. We find that the energy par sites of the HSS state is $e_0=E_0/N\n=-1.41095$, which is readily lower than that of the TVBS state ($e_0=-1.3912\n\\pm 0.0025$). This agrees well with those of the cylindrical ($e_0=-1.40988$)\nand periodic ($e_0=-1.409 \\pm 0.005$) clusters, where no assumption as to the\nordering is posed. Thus, we conclude that the HSS picture is consistent to\ndescribe the ground state of the $S=1$ Kagome Heisenberg model.

Standard procedures to\nexplore the properties of lipid bilayer and hemifused states typically use\neither supported membranes or vesicles. Both techniques have several\nshortcoming in terms of bio relevance or accessibility for measurements. In\nthis article the formation of individual free standing hemifused states between\nmodel cell membranes is studied using an optimized microfluidic scheme which\nallows for simultaneous optical and electrophysiological measurements. In a\nfirst step, two model membranes are formed at a desired location within a\nmicrofluidic device using a variation of the droplet interface bilayer (DiB)\ntechnique. In a second step, the two model membranes are brought into contact\nforming a single hemifused state. For all tested lipids, the hemifused state\nbetween free standing membranes form within hundreds of milliseconds, i.e.\nseveral orders of magnitude faster than reported in literature. The formation\nof a hemifused state is observed as a two stage process, whereas the second\nstage can be explained as a dewetting process in no-slip boundary condition.\nThe formed hemifusion states are long living and a single fusion event can be\nobserved when triggered by an applied electric field as demonstrated for\nmonoolein.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Sep 2014 11:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

An important practical issue is the\nspecification of appropriate boundary conditions on this boundary, often\nconditions of complete transparency. Attention to this issue has been paid\nelsewhere, and here we consider a different, although related, issue: far-field\nsignal recovery. Namely, from smooth data recorded on the outer boundary we\nwish to recover the far-field signal which would reach arbitrarily large\ndistances. These signals encode information about interior scatterers and often\ncorrespond to actual measurements. This article expresses far-field signal\nrecovery in terms of time-domain convolutions, each between a solution\nmultipole moment recorded at the boundary and a sum-of-exponentials kernel.\nEach exponential corresponds to a pole term in the Laplace transform of the\nkernel, a finite sum of simple poles. Greengard, Hagstrom, and Jiang have\nderived the large-$\\ell$ (spherical-harmonic index) asymptotic expansion for\nthe pole residues, and their analysis shows that, when expressed in terms of\nthe exact sum-of-exponentials, large-$\\ell$ signal recovery is plagued by\ncancellation errors. Nevertheless, through an alternative integral\nrepresentation of the kernel and its subsequent approximation by a {\\em\nsmaller} number of exponential terms (kernel compression), we are able to\nalleviate these errors and achieve accurate signal recovery. We empirically\nexamine scaling relations between the parameters which determine a compressed\nkernel, and perform numerical tests of signal \"teleportation\" from one radial\nvalue $r_1$ to another $r_2$, including the case $r_2=\\infty$.

During sprouting, a highly motile type of\nendothelial cell, called the tip cell, migrates from the blood vessels followed\nby stalk cells, an endothelial cell type that forms the body of the sprout. To\nget more insight into how tip cells contribute to angiogenesis, we extended an\nexisting computational model of vascular network formation based on the\ncellular Potts model with tip and stalk differentiation, without making a\npriori assumptions about the differences between tip cells and stalk cells. To\npredict potential differences, we looked for parameter values that make tip\ncells (a) move to the sprout tip, and (b) change the morphology of the\nangiogenic networks. The screening predicted that if tip cells respond less\neffectively to an endothelial chemoattractant than stalk cells, they move to\nthe tips of the sprouts, which impacts the morphology of the networks. A\ncomparison of this model prediction with genes expressed differentially in tip\nand stalk cells revealed that the endothelial chemoattractant Apelin and its\nreceptor APJ may match the model prediction. To test the model prediction we\ninhibited Apelin signaling in our model and in an \\emph{in vitro} model of\nangiogenic sprouting, and found that in both cases inhibition of Apelin or of\nits receptor APJ reduces sprouting. Based on the prediction of the\ncomputational model, we propose that the differential expression of Apelin and\nAPJ yields a \"self-generated\" gradient mechanisms that accelerates the\nextension of the sprout.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Sep 2014 15:09:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 15:46:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 13:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-11"}

Next due to joint analysis with Stern+BAO and Stern+BAO+CMB\nobservations, we have also obtained the bounds of the parameters ($A,B$) by\nfixing some other parameters $\\alpha$, $w_{m}$ and $\\omega$. From the best fit\nvalues of the parameters, we have obtained the distance modulus $\\mu(z)$ for\nour theoretical GCCG model in LQC and from Supernovae Type Ia (union2 sample\n552 data from [\\cite{Amanullah}] \\& Riess 292 data from\n[\\cite{Riess1,Riess2,Astier}]), we have concluded that our model is in\nagreement with the Supernovae Type Ia sample data.
