One of the main channels of shock\npropagation among countries is the International Trade Network (ITN). Two\nimportant models for the ITN structure, the classical gravity model of trade\n(more popular among economists) and the fitness model (more popular among\nnetworks scientists), are both limited to the characterization of only one\nrepresentation of the ITN. The gravity model satisfactorily predicts the volume\nof trade between connected countries, but cannot reproduce the observed missing\nlinks (i.e. the topology). On the other hand, the fitness model can\nsuccessfully replicate the topology of the ITN, but cannot predict the volumes.\nThis paper tries to make an important step forward in the unification of those\ntwo frameworks, by proposing a new GDP-driven model which can simultaneously\nreproduce the binary and the weighted properties of the ITN. Specifically, we\nadopt a maximum-entropy approach where both the degree and the strength of each\nnode is preserved. We then identify strong nonlinear relationships between the\nGDP and the parameters of the model. This ultimately results in a weighted\ngeneralization of the fitness model of trade, where the GDP plays the role of a\n`macroeconomic fitness' shaping the binary and the weighted structure of the\nITN simultaneously. Our model mathematically highlights an important asymmetry\nin the role of binary and weighted network properties, namely the fact that\nbinary properties can be inferred without the knowledge of weighted ones, while\nthe opposite is not true.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 16:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-23"}

The present formulation constitutes a\ngeneralization also for the quantum thermodynamics framework. In the SEA\nmodeling principle a key role is played by the geometrical metric with respect\nto which to measure the length of a trajectory in state space. In the near\nequilibrium limit, the metric tensor is related to the Onsager's generalized\nresistivity tensor. Therefore, through the identification of a suitable metric\nfield which generalizes the Onsager generalized resistance to the arbitrarily\nfar non-equilibrium domain, most of the existing theories of non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics can be cast in such a way that the state exhibits a spontaneous\ntendency to evolve in state space along the path of SEA compatible with the\nconservation constraints and the boundary conditions. The resulting unified\nfamily of SEA dynamical models is intrinsically and strongly consistent with\nthe second law of thermodynamics. Non-negativity of the entropy production is a\nreadily proved general feature of SEA dynamics. In several of the different\napproaches to non-equilibrium description we consider here, the SEA concept has\nnot been investigated before. We believe it defines the precise meaning and the\ndomain of general validity of the so-called Maximum Entropy Production\nPrinciple. It is hoped that the present unifying approach may prove useful in\nproviding a fresh basis for effective, thermodynamically consistent, numerical\nmodels and theoretical treatments of irreversible conservative relaxation\ntowards equilibrium from far non-equilibrium states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 17:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-14"}

The measured ages and mass fraction of the young stellar\npopulations do not strongly trend with measurements of galaxy morphology. We\nnote that massive (log(M[$M_{\\odot}$])>10.5) recently star-forming ETGs appear\nto have larger sizes. Furthermore, high-mass, quiescent ETGs identified with\nlikely companions populate a distinct region in the size-mass parameter space,\nin comparison with the distribution of massive ETGs with evidence of RSF. We\nconclude that both mechanisms of the quenching of star-formation in disk-like\nETGs and (gas-rich, minor) merger activity contribute to the formation of young\nstars and the size-mass evolution of intermediate redshift ETGs. The number of\nETGs for which we have both HST WFC3 panchromatic (especially UV) imaging and\nspectroscopically-confirmed redshifts is relatively small, therefore a\nconclusion on the relative roles of both of these mechanisms remains an open\nquestion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 17:58:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

This establishes an order homomorphism from a\nbase poset to a poset over real intervals, and a standard (canonical) specific\ninterval rank function is available as an extreme case. Various ordering\nrelations are available over intervals, and we begin in this paper by\nconsidering conjugate orders which \"partition\" the space of pairwise\ncomparisons of order elements.

The standard LK mechanism\nconsists of large-amplitude oscillations in eccentricity and inclination of a\nbinary subject to the quadrupole potential from an outer perturber. Recent work\nhas shown that when the octupole terms are included in the potential, the inner\nbinary can reach more extreme eccentricities as well as undergo orientation\nflips. It is known that pericenter precessions due to short-range effects, such\nas General Relativity and tidal and rotational distortions, can limit the\ngrowth of eccentricity and even suppress standard (quadrupolar) LK\noscillations, but their effect on the octupole-level LK mechanism has not been\nfully explored. In this paper, we systematically study how these short-range\nforces affect the extreme orbital behaviour found in octupole LK cycles. In\ngeneral, the influence of the octupole potential is confined to a range of\ninitial mutual inclinations Itot centered around 90deg (when the inner binary\nmass ratio is <<1), with this range expanding with increasing octupole\nstrength. We find that, while the short-range forces do not change the width\nand location of this \"window of influence\", they impose a strict upper limit on\nthe maximum achievable eccentricity. This limiting eccentricity can be\ncalculated analytically, and its value holds even for strong octupole potential\nand for the general case of three comparable masses. Short-range forces also\naffect orbital flips, progressively reducing the range of Itot within which\nflips are possible as the intensity of these forces increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 22:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Such new fields are within\nreach of the LHC, at which they can be pair produced leaving a distinctive,\ndisplaced-vertex signature.

In analogy to missing energy searches for WIMP\ndark matter, the LHC is an excellent probe of these new long-lived particles\nresponsible for baryogenesis via the low-background displaced vertex channel.\nIn our paper, we estimate the limits on simplified models inspired by WIMP\nbaryogenesis from two of the most sensitive collider searches by CMS and ATLAS\nwith 8 TeV LHC data.

Using this survey-agnostic approach, I confirm that the Neptune\nTrojans are a dynamically excited population: at $>$95% confidence, the Neptune\nTrojans' inclination width must be $\\sigma_i > 11^\\circ$. For comparison and\nmotivation purposes, I also model the Jupiter Trojan orbit distributions in the\nsame basis and produce new estimates of their parameters (Jupiter Trojan\n$\\sigma_i=14.4^\\circ \\pm 0.5^\\circ$, $\\sigma_{L11} = 11.8^\\circ \\pm 0.5^\\circ$,\nand $\\sigma_e = 0.061\\pm 0.002$).

This is done by taking intersections of\nthe orbit of flow by a hyper-plane parallel to one of the coordinate\nhyper-planes of co-dimension one. Naturally for a 3D-attractor, the Poincare\nmap gives rise to 2D points, which can describe the dynamics of the attractor\nproperly. In a very special case, sometimes these 2D points are considered as\ntheir 1D-projections to obtain a 1D map. However, this is an artificial way of\nreducing the 2D map by dropping one of the variables. Sometimes it is found\nthat the two coordinates of the points on the Poincare section are functionally\nrelated. This also reduces the 2D Poincare map to a 1D map.

In fact, we find out some examples, which show that\neven this natural reduction of the 2D Poincare map is not always justified,\nbecause the resultant 1D map may fail to generate the original dynamics.

A number of chemical shift predictors\nbased on the relationship between structures resolved with X-ray\ncrystallography and the corresponding experimental chemical shifts have been\ndeveloped. These empirical predictors are very accurate on X-ray structures but\ntends to be insensitive to small structural changes. To overcome this\nlimitation it has been suggested to make chemical shift predictors based on\nquantum mechanical(QM) calculations. In this thesis the development of the QM\nderived chemical shift predictor Procs14 is presented. Procs14 is based on 2.35\nmillion density functional theory(DFT) calculations on tripeptides and contains\ncorrections for hydrogen bonding, ring current and the effect of the previous\nand following residue. Procs14 is capable at performing predictions for the\n13CA, 13CB, 13CO, 15NH, 1HN and 1HA backbone atoms. In order to benchmark\nProcs14, a number of QM NMR calculations are performed on full protein\nstructures. Of the tested empirical and QM derived predictors, Procs14\nreproduced the QM chemical shifts with the highest accuracy. A comparison with\nthe QM derived predictor CheShift-2 on X-ray structures and NMR ensembles with\nexperimental chemical shift data, showed that Procs14 predicted the chemical\nshifts with the best accuracy. The predictions on the NMR ensembles exhibited\nthe best performance. This suggests that future work might benefit from using\nensemble sampling when performing simulations of protein folding with chemical\nshifts. Procs14 is implemented in the markov chain monte carlo protein folding\nframework PHAISTOS. The computational efficient implementation of Procs14\nallows for rapid predictions and therefore potential use in refinement and\nfolding of protein structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 23:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-25"}

This radiation-induced softening (RIS) effect should be taken into\naccount both in the theory of radiation effects and in the engineering approach\nfor technological applications. In the present paper, the RIS is investigated\nexperimentally in polycrystalline technically pure iron (0.048%C) and in\ncommercial ferritic steel. The effect of the electron beam on plastic\ndeformation of bcc Fe is compared with that in fcc Al (99.5%). Electron energy\nranged from 0.5 to 0.8 MeV. Reversible drop of the yield stress and\nradiation-induced reduction of the elongation to fracture are measured as\nfunctions of the electron current and specimen thickness. Rate theory of RIS is\nproposed, which takes into account the radiation-induced excitation of moving\ndiscrete breathers (DBs), recently proven to exist in bcc Fe, and their\ninteraction with dislocations enhancing unpinning from structural defects. The\nbehavior of the DBs is studied using classical MD simulations providing input\nfor the modified rate theory, which eventually demonstrates a reasonable\nagreement with experimental data.

At a 3D point, HOPC is computed by\nprojecting the three scaled eigenvectors of the pointcloud within its local\nspatio-temporal support volume onto the vertices of a regular dodecahedron.\nHOPC is also used for the detection of Spatio-Temporal Keypoints (STK) in 3D\npointcloud sequences so that view-invariant STK descriptors (or Local HOPC\ndescriptors) at these key locations only are used for action recognition.

The atmospheres of brown dwarfs are relatively well understood, but\nsome problems remain, in particular the behavior of clouds at the L/T\ntransition.

Unlike the\nnearly rigidly rotating Sun, these evolved stars contain radiative cores that\nspin faster than their overlying convective envelopes, but slower than they\nwould in the absence of internal angular momentum transport. We investigate the\nrole of internal gravity waves in angular momentum transport in evolving low\nmass stars. In agreement with previous results, we find that convectively\nexcited gravity waves can prevent the development of strong differential\nrotation in the radiative cores of Sun-like stars. As stars evolve into\nsub-giants, however, low frequency gravity waves become strongly attenuated and\ncannot propagate below the hydrogen burning shell, allowing the spin of the\ncore to decouple from the convective envelope. This decoupling occurs at the\nbase of the sub-giant branch when stars have surface temperatures of roughly\n5500 K. However, gravity waves can still spin down the upper radiative region,\nimplying that the observed differential rotation is likely confined to the deep\ncore near the hydrogen burning shell. The torque on the upper radiative region\nmay also prevent the core from accreting high-angular momentum material and\nslow the rate of core spin-up. The observed spin-down of cores on the red giant\nbranch cannot be totally attributed to gravity waves, but the waves may enhance\nshear within the radiative region and thus increase the efficacy of\nviscous/magnetic torques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 05:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

Introducing magnetism into TI, which breaks the TRS, is expected to\ncreate exotic topological magnetoelectric effects. A particularly intriguing\nphenomenon in this case is the magnetic field dependence of electrical\nresistance, or magnetoresistance (MR). The intricate interplay between\ntopological protection and broken-TRS may lead to highly unconventional MR\nbehaviour that can find unique applications in magnetic sensing and data\nstorage. However, so far the MR of TI with spontaneously broken TRS is still\npoorly understood, mainly due to the lack of well-controlled experiments. In\nthis work, we investigate the magneto transport properties of a ferromagnetic\nTI thin film fabricated into a field effect transistor device. We observe an\nunusually complex evolution of MR when the Fermi level (EF) is tuned across the\nDirac point (DP) by gate voltage. In particular, MR tends to be positive when\nEF lies close to the DP but becomes negative at higher energies. This trend is\nopposite to that expected from the Berry phase picture for localization, but is\nintimately correlated with the gate-tuned magnetic order. We show that the\nunderlying physics is the competition between the topology-induced weak\nantilocalization and magnetism-induced negative MR.

The best\nscenario to explain this paradox is that there is another massive body in this\nsystem, Fom c, which drives the debris disk shape. The resulting planetary\nsystem is highly unstable, which hints at a dynamical scenario involving a\nrecent scattering of Fom b on its current orbit, potentially with the putative\nFom c.\n  Our goal is to give insights on the probability for Fom b to have been set on\nits highly eccentric orbit by a close-encounter with the putative Fom c. We aim\nto study in particular the part played by mean-motion resonances with Fom c,\nwhich could have brought Fom b sufficiently close to Fom c for it to be\nscattered on its current orbit, but also delay this scattering event.\n  Using N-body simulations, we found that the generation of orbits similar to\nthat of Fom b, either in term of dimensions or orientation, is a robust process\ninvolving a scattering event and a further secular evolution of inner material\nwith an eccentric massive body such as the putative Fom c. We found in\nparticular that mean-motion resonances can delay scattering events, and thus\nthe production of Fom b-like orbits, on timescales comparable to the age of the\nsystem, thus explaining the witnessing of an unstable configuration.\n  We conclude that Fom b probably originated from an inner resonance with Fom\nc, which is at least Neptune-Saturn size, and was set on its current orbit by a\nscattering event with Fom c. Since Fom b could not have formed from material in\nresonance, our scenario also hints at former migration processes in this\nplanetary system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 09:23:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 09:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

For instance, some analyses of cold clumps (7 K- 17 K) indicate\nthat the aggregation process is favored in dense environments. However,\nstudying warm (30 K-40 K) dust emission at long wavelength ($\\lambda$$>$300\n$\\mu$m) has been limited because it is difficult to combine far\ninfared-to-millimeter (FIR-to-mm) spectral coverage and high angular resolution\nfor observations of warm dust grains. Using Herschel data from 70 to 500\n$\\mu$m, which are part of the Herschel infrared Galactic (Hi-GAL) survey\ncombined with 1.1 mm data from the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), we\ncompared emission in two types of environments: ultra-compact HII (UCHII)\nregions, and cold molecular clumps (denoted as cold clumps). With this\ncomparison we tested dust emission models in the FIR-to-mm domain that\nreproduce emission in the diffuse medium, in these two environments (UCHII\nregions and cold clumps). We also investigated their ability to predict the\ndust emission in our Galaxy. We determined the emission spectra in twelve UCHII\nregions and twelve cold clumps, and derived the dust temperature (T) using the\nrecent two-level system (TLS) model with three sets of parameters and the\nso-called T-$\\beta$ (temperature-dust emissvity index) phenomenological models,\nwith $\\beta$ set to 1.5, 2 and 2.5. We tested the applicability of the TLS\nmodel in warm regions for the first time. This analysis indicates distinct\ntrends in the dust emission between cold and warm environments that are visible\nthrough changes in the dust emissivity index. However, with the use of standard\nparameters, the TLS model is able to reproduce the spectral behavior observed\nin cold and warm regions, from the change of the dust temperature alone,\nwhereas a T-$\\beta$ model requires $\\beta$ to be known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 10:49:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 12:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

In the context of these possible futures, we show\nthat the causal entropic principle, whereby agents follow behavioural rules\nthat maximise their entropy over all paths through the future, predicts many of\nthe observed features of social interactions between individuals in both human\nand animal groups. Our results indicate that agents are often able to maximise\ntheir future path entropy by remaining cohesive as a group, and that this\ncohesion leads to collectively intelligent outcomes that depend strongly on the\ndistribution of the number of future paths that are possible. We derive social\ninteraction rules that are consistent with maximum-entropy group behaviour for\nboth discrete and continuous decision spaces. Our analysis further predicts\nthat social interactions are likely to be fundamentally based on Weber's law of\nresponse to proportional stimuli, supporting many studies that find a\nneurological basis for this stimulus-response mechanism, and providing a novel\nbasis for the common assumption of linearly additive 'social forces' in\nsimulation studies of collective behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 10:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-20"}

We refine the theoretical description\nof tidal interactions (hitherto known only to the second post-Newtonian level)\nby extending our recently developed analytic self-force formalism, for extreme\nmass-ratio binary systems, to the computation of several tidal invariants.\nSpecifically, we compute, to linear order in the mass ratio and to the\n7.5$^{\\rm th}$ post-Newtonian order, the following tidal invariants: the square\nand the cube of the gravitoelectric quadrupolar tidal tensor, the square of the\ngravitomagnetic quadrupolar tidal tensor, and the square of the gravitoelectric\noctupolar tidal tensor. Our high-accuracy analytic results are compared to\nrecent numerical self-force tidal data by Dolan et al. \\cite{Dolan:2014pja},\nand, notably, provide an analytic understanding of the light ring asymptotic\nbehavior found by them. We transcribe our kinematical tidal-invariant results\nin the more dynamically significant effective one-body description of the tidal\ninteraction energy. By combining, in a synergetic manner, analytical and\nnumerical results, we provide simple, accurate analytic representations of the\nglobal, strong-field behavior of the gravitoelectric quadrupolar tidal factor.\nA striking finding is that the linear-in-mass-ratio piece in the latter tidal\nfactor changes sign in the strong-field domain, to become negative (while its\npreviously known second post-Newtonian approximant was always positive). We,\nhowever, argue that this will be more than compensated by a probable fast\ngrowth, in the strong-field domain, of the nonlinear-in-mass-ratio\ncontributions in the tidal factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 12:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-17"}

We use the magnetic\nDoppler imaging code, INVERS10, which allows us to derive the magnetic field\ngeometry and surface chemical abundance distributions simultaneously.\n  Results: We report magnetic maps of HD 24712 recovered from a selection of\nFeI, FeII, NdIII, and NaI lines with strong polarization signals in all Stokes\nparameters. Our magnetic maps successfully reproduce most of the details\navailable from our observation data. We used these magnetic field maps to\nproduce abundance distribution map of Ca.

Fitting regression mixtures is challenging and is usually\nperformed by maximum likelihood by using the expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm. However, it is well-known that the initialization is crucial for EM.\nIf the initialization is inappropriately performed, the EM algorithm may lead\nto unsatisfactory results. The EM algorithm also requires the number of\nclusters to be given a priori; the problem of selecting the number of mixture\ncomponents requires using model selection criteria to choose one from a set of\npre-estimated candidate models. We propose a new fully unsupervised algorithm\nto learn regression mixture models with unknown number of components. The\ndeveloped unsupervised learning approach consists in a penalized maximum\nlikelihood estimation carried out by a robust expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm for fitting polynomial, spline and B-spline regressions mixtures. The\nproposed learning approach is fully unsupervised: 1) it simultaneously infers\nthe model parameters and the optimal number of the regression mixture\ncomponents from the data as the learning proceeds, rather than in a two-fold\nscheme as in standard model-based clustering using afterward model selection\ncriteria, and 2) it does not require accurate initialization unlike the\nstandard EM for regression mixtures. The developed approach is applied to curve\nclustering problems. Numerical experiments on simulated data show that the\nproposed robust EM algorithm performs well and provides accurate results in\nterms of robustness with regard initialization and retrieving the optimal\npartition with the actual number of clusters. An application to real data in\nthe framework of functional data clustering, confirms the benefit of the\nproposed approach for practical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 14:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-25"}

Due to the strong pressure anisotropies that arise,\nwe study magnetic reconnection with a Gaussian-moment two-fluid MHD with\nisotropization of the pressure tensor. For the GEM magnetic reconnection\nchallenge problem, our deviatoric pressure tensor agrees well with published\nkinetic simulations at the time of peak reconnection, but sometime thereafter\nthe numerical solution becomes unpredictable and develops near-singularities\nthat crash the simulation unless positivity limiters are applied. To explain\nthese difficulties, we show that steady reconnection requires heat flux.\nSpecifically, for two-dimensional problems invariant under 180-degree rotation\nabout the X-point, entropy production in the vicinity of the X-point is\nnecessary for reconnection and causes solutions to become singular for\nconservative models that lack heat flux. This prompts the need for a 10-moment\ngyrotropic heat flux closure. Using a Chapman-Enskog expansion with a\nGaussian-BGK collision operator yields a heat flux closure for a magnetized\n10-moment charged gas which generalizes the closure of McDonald and Groth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 15:04:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 11:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-26"}

We have measured the flow\ninduced voltage generation on OTS SAM coated Si wafers/ Uncoated Si wafers at\nmodest gas flow velocities of subsonic regime (Mach number < 0.2) using\nnational instruments NI-PXI-1044 Workstation. The gas flow driven voltage\ngeneration is mainly due to the interplay mechanisms of Bernoulli principle and\nSeebeck effect. The surface morphology of OTS SAM coated p-Si and n-Si wafers\nwere characterized by SEM analysis. In this study, our results shows that OTS\nSAM coated p-Si and n-Si wafers shows better sensitivity towards nitrogen gas\nflow when compared with the uncoated Si wafers. OTS SAM also exhibits high\nthermal stability and hydrophobicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 03:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-26"}

The present article considers a very\nrare biomedical signal like Electromyography (EMG) signal. It determines\nsuitable time delay and reconstruct the attractor of embedding diemnsion three.\nBy measuring its Lyapunov exponent, the attractor so reconstructed is found to\nbe chaotic. Naturally the Poincare map obtained by corresponding Poincare\nsection is to be chaotic too. This may be verified by calculation of Lyapunov\nexponent of the map. The main objective of this article is to show that\nPoincare map exists in this case as a 2D map for a suitable Poincare section\nonly. In fact, the article considers two Poincare sections of the attractor for\nconstruction of the Poincare map. It is seen that one such map is chaotic but\nthe other one is not so, both are verified by calculation of Lyapunov exponent\nof the map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 20:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-30"}
