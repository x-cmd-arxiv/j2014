The two\nshell models, which allow such a construction, are considered: the dyadic\n(Desnyansky--Novikov) model with the intershell ratio $\\lambda = 2^{3/2}$ and\nthe Sabra model of turbulence with $\\lambda = \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{5}} \\approx 2.058$.\nThe continuous models allow understanding various properties of shell model\nsolutions and provide their interpretation in physical space. We show that the\nasymptotic solutions of the dyadic model with Kolmogorov scaling correspond to\nthe shocks (discontinuities) for the induced continuous solutions in physical\nspace, and the finite-time blowup together with its viscous regularization\nfollow the scenario similar to the Burgers equation.

Sol claims that traits such as persistence\nand neophilia, are necessary and sufficient for animal innovation, which is a\nmatter of trial and error. We suggest that this explanation does not extend to\nhuman innovation, which involves strategy, logic, intuition, and insight, and\nrequires traits that evolved, not as a byproduct of some other function, but\nfor the purpose of coming up with adaptive responses to environmental\nvariability itself. We point to an agent based model that indicates the\nfeasibility of two such proposed traits: (1) chaining, the ability to construct\ncomplex thoughts from simple ones, and (2) contextual focus, the ability to\nshift between convergent and divergent modes of thought. We agree that there is\na sense in which innovation is exaptation--it occurs when an existing object or\nbehaviour is adapted to new needs or tastes--and refer to a mathematical model\nof biological and cultural exaltation. We conclude that much is gained by\ncomparing and contrasting animal and human innovation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 16:56:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 21:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

The common theme which underpins these pieces\nof work is the presence of non-adiabatic pressure, or entropy, perturbations.\nAfter a brief introduction covering the standard techniques of describing\ninhomogeneities in both Newtonian and relativistic cosmology, I discuss the\ngeneration of vorticity. As in classical fluid mechanics, vorticity is not\npresent in linearized perturbation theory (unless included as an initial\ncondition). Allowing for entropy perturbations, and working to second order in\nperturbation theory, I show that vorticity is generated, even in the absence of\nvector perturbations, by purely scalar perturbations, the source term being\nquadratic in the gradients of first order energy density and isocurvature, or\nnon-adiabatic pressure perturbations. This generalizes Crocco's theorem to a\ncosmological setting. I then introduce isocurvature perturbations in different\nmodels, focusing on the entropy perturbation in standard, concordance\ncosmology, and in inflationary models involving two scalar fields. As the final\ntopic, I investigate magnetic fields, which are a potential observational\nconsequence of vorticity in the early universe. I briefly review some recent\nwork on including magnetic fields in perturbation theory in a consistent way. I\nshow, using solely analytical techniques, that magnetic fields can be generated\nby higher order perturbations, albeit too small to provide the entire\nprimordial seed field, in agreement with some numerical studies.

We investigate this scenario in depth using 42 relativistic\n2D simulations with multi-group neutrino transport to examine the effects of\nvelocity and density perturbations in the progenitor for different perturbation\ngeometries that obey fundamental physical constraints (like the anelastic\ncondition). As a framework for analysing our results, we introduce\nsemi-empirical scaling laws relating neutrino heating, average turbulent\nvelocities in the gain region, and the shock deformation in the saturation\nlimit of non-radial instabilities. The squared turbulent Mach number, <Ma^2>,\nreflects the violence of aspherical motions in the gain layer, and explosive\nrunaway occurs for <Ma^2>~0.3, corresponding to a reduction of the critical\nneutrino luminosity by ~25% compared to 1D. In the light of this theory,\nprogenitor asphericities aid shock revival mainly by creating anisotropic mass\nflux onto the shock: Differential infall efficiently converts velocity\nperturbations in the progenitor into density perturbations (Delta rho/rho) at\nthe shock of the order of the initial convective Mach number Ma. The\nanisotropic mass flux and ram pressure deform the shock and thereby amplify\npost-shock turbulence. Large-scale (l=2,l=1) modes prove most conducive to\nshock revival, whereas small-scale perturbations require unrealistically high\nconvective Mach numbers. Initial density perturbations in the progenitor are\nonly of order Ma^2 and therefore play a subdominant role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 20:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2015 10:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-22"}

We\nshow that all these different forms of quantum computation belong to a common\nnew restricted model of quantum operations that we call \\emph{black-box\nnormalizer circuits}. To define these, we extend the previous model of\nnormalizer circuits [arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208], which\nare built of quantum Fourier transforms, group automorphism and quadratic phase\ngates associated to an Abelian group $G$. In previous works, the group $G$ is\nalways given in an explicitly decomposed form. In our model, we remove this\nassumption and allow $G$ to be a black-box group. While standard normalizer\ncircuits were shown to be efficiently classically simulable\n[arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208], we find that normalizer\ncircuits are powerful enough to factorize and solve classically-hard problems\nin the black-box setting. We further set upper limits to their computational\npower by showing that decomposing finite Abelian groups is complete for the\nassociated complexity class. In particular, solving this problem renders\nblack-box normalizer circuits efficiently classically simulable by exploiting\nthe generalized stabilizer formalism in\n[arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208].

We present the high S/N VLT/X-shooter spectrum\nof GRB130606A at z=5.913. We aim to measure the degree of ionisation of the IGM\nbetween 5.02<z<5.84 and to study the chemical abundance pattern and dust\ncontent of its host galaxy. We measured the flux decrement due to absorption at\nLy$\\alpha$, $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ wavelength regions. The hydrogen and metal\nabsorption lines formed in the host galaxy were fitted with Voigt profiles to\nobtain column densities. Our measurements of the Ly$\\alpha$-forest optical\ndepth are consistent with previous measurements of QSOs, but have a much\nsmaller uncertainty. The analysis of the red damping wing yields a neutral\nfraction $x_{HI}<0.05$ (3$\\sigma$). We obtain column density measurements of\nseveral elements. The ionisation corrections due to the GRB is estimated to be\nnegligible (<0.03 dex), but larger corrections may apply due to the\npre-existing radiation field (up to 0.4 dex based on sub-DLA studies).

We find that $f(r)$ is achieved only by linear\nhypergraphs for $r\\le5$, but that this is not the case for $r\\in\\{6,7\\}$. We\nalso improve the general lower bound on $f(r)$, showing that $f(r)\\ge\n3.052r+O(1)$.\n  We show that a stronger form of Ryser's conjecture that was used to prove the\n$r=3$ case fails for all $r>3$. We also prove a fractional version of the\nfollowing stronger form of Ryser's conjecture: in an $r$-partite hypergraph\nthere exists a set $S$ of size at most $r-1$, contained either in one side of\nthe hypergraph or in an edge, whose removal reduces the matching number by 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 23:51:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 May 2015 04:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-31"}

The Kitaev model is one of the solvable\nquantum spin models, where the ground state is given by gapped and gapless spin\nliquids, depending on the anisotropy of the interactions. This model can be\nrewritten as a free Majorana fermion system coupled with $Z_2$ variables. The\ndensity of states of Majorana fermions shows an excitation gap in the gapped\nregion, while it is semimetallic in the gapless region reflecting the Dirac\nnode. Performing the Monte Carlo simulation, we calculate the temperature\ndependence of the Majorana spectra.

Such changes of the low-energy spectrum appear sharply at the\ntransition temperature from the spin liquid to the paramagnetic state.

The difficulty is\nthat the traditional estimate of the superconducting coherence length is very\nshort and anisotropic in these materials, typically ~2 nm in the a-b plane and\n~0.2 nm along the c-axis. The coherence volume encloses very few\nsuperconducting pairs, so even the presence of small scale inhomogeneities can\nlocally disrupt superconductivity unlike in conventional superconductors.\nTherefore the electrical properties of Josephson junctions are sensitive to\nchemical variations and structural defects on atomic length scales, thus to\nmake multiple uniform HTS junctions, control at the atomic level is required.\nIn this letter, we demonstrate very high-quality all-HTS Josephson\nsuperconducting tunnel junctions (both Josephson and quasiparticle tunneling)\ncreated by using a 500 pm diameter focused beam of helium ions to direct-write\ntunnel barriers into YBa2Cu3O7(YBCO) thin films. With this method we\ndemonstrate the ability to control the barrier properties continuously from\nconducting to insulating by varying the irradiation dose.

The high resolution CRIRES spectra are\nmodelled, and are well fitted under the assumption that the emission originates\nfrom small scale Keplerian discs, interior to the dust sublimation radius, but\noutside the co-rotation radius of the central stars. In addition, our findings\nare in very good agreement for the one object where spatially resolved\nnear-infrared interferometric studies have also been performed.

The 0.9-mm continuum shows two opposing U-shaped\nbrightenings in the circumbinary disk, and exhibits a depression between the\ncircumbinary disk and the circumstellar disk of the primary protostar. The\nmolecular lines trace non-axisymmetric deviations from Keplerian rotation in\nthe circumbinary disk at higher velocities relative to the systemic velocity,\nwhere our previous SMA observations could not detect the lines. In addition, we\ndetect inward motion along the minor axis of the circumbinary disk. To explain\nthe newly-observed features, we performed a numerical simulation of gas orbits\nin a Roche potential tailored to the inferred properties of L1551 NE. The\nobserved U-shaped dust features coincide with locations where gravitational\ntorques from the central binary system are predicted to impart angular momentum\nto the circumbinary disk, producing shocks and hence density enhancements seen\nas a pair of spiral arms. The observed inward gas motion coincides with\nlocations where angular momentum is predicted to be lowered by the\ngravitational torques.

An exhaustive experimental characterization of\nthe relationship between genotypes and phenotypes is at present out of reach.\nTherefore, several models mimicking that map have been proposed and\ninvestigated, leading to the identification of a number of general features:\ngenotypes differ in their robustness to mutations, phenotypes are represented\nby a broadly varying number of genotypes, and simple point mutations seem to\nsuffice to navigate the space of genotypes while maintaining a phenotype.\nHowever, most current models address only one level of the map (sequences and\nfolded structures in RNA or proteins; networks of genes and their dynamical\nattractors; sets of chemical reactions and their ability to undergo molecular\ncatalysis), such that many relevant questions cannot be addressed. Here we\nintroduce toyLIFE, a multi-level model for the genotype-phenotype map based on\nsimple genomes and interaction rules from which a complex behavior at upper\nlevels emerges, remarkably plastic gene regulatory networks and metabolism.\ntoyLIFE is a tool that permits the investigation of how different levels are\ncoupled, in particular how and where do mutations affect phenotype or how the\npresence of certain metabolites determines the dynamics of toyLIFE gene\nregulatory networks. The possibilities of this model are not exhausted by the\nresults presented in this contribution.

Sixty-eight times of minimum light with\naccuracies better than 10 s were used for the ephemeris computations. The best\nfit to those timings indicated that the orbital period of NY Vir has varied due\nto a combination of two sinusoids with periods of $P_3$=8.2 yr and $P_4$=27.0\nyr and semi-amplitudes of $K_3$=6.9 s and $K_4$=27.3 s, respectively. The\nperiodic variations most likely arise from a pair of light-time effects due to\nthe presence of third and fourth bodies that are gravitationally bound to the\neclipsing pair.

A dynamical analysis suggests that the outer companion is less\nlikely to orbit the binary on a circular orbit.

Essentially, the heuristic reduces a second-order problem\nto a first-order/propositional one, while the validation is often just a call\nto a SAT/SMT solver. This results in a monolithic design of such analyses that\nconflates the formulation of the problem with the solving process.\nConsequently, any change to the latter causes changes to the whole analysis.\nThis design is dictated by the state of the art in solver technology. While\nSAT/SMT solvers have experienced tremendous progress, there are barely any\nsecond-order solvers. This paper takes a step towards addressing this situation\nby proposing a decidable fragment of second-order logic that is still\nexpressive enough to capture numerous program analysis problems (e.g. safety\nproving, bug finding, termination and non-termination proving,\nsuperoptimisation). We refer to the satisfiability problem for this fragment as\nSecond-Order SAT and show it is NEXPTIME-complete. Finally, we build a decision\nprocedure for Second-Order SAT based on program synthesis and present\nexperimental evidence that our approach is tractable for program analysis\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 09:44:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Oct 2014 16:33:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 11:47:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 17 Jan 2015 14:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-20"}

The functional architecture is thought to play a\ncentral role in this task, by encoding efficiently complex stimuli and\nfacilitating higher level processing. In the early visual cortex of higher\nmammals, information is processed within functional maps whose layout is\nthought to underlie visual perception. The possible principles underlying the\ntopology of the different maps, as well as the role of a specific functional\narchitecture on information processing, is however poorly understood. We\ndemonstrate mathematically here that two natural principles, local exhaustivity\nof representation and parsimony, would constrain the orientation and spatial\nfrequency maps to display co-located singularities around which the orientation\nis organized as a pinwheel and spatial frequency as a dipole. This observation\nis perfectly in line with new optical imaging data on the cat visual cortex we\nanalyze in a companion paper. Here we further focus on the theoretical\nimplications of this structure. Using a computational model, we show that this\narchitecture allows a trade-off in the local perception of orientation and\nspatial frequency, but this would occur for sharper selectivity than the tuning\nwidth reported in the literature. We therefore re-examined physiological data\nand show that indeed the spatial frequency selectivity substantially sharpens\nnear maps singularities, bringing to the prediction that the system tends to\noptimize balanced detection between different attributes. These results shed\nnew light on the principles at play in the emergence of functional architecture\nof cortical maps, as well as their potential role in processing information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 09:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

One basic network\nproperty that relates to the structure of the links found is the degree\nassortativity, which is a measure of the correlation between the degrees of the\nnodes at the end of the links. Degree correlations are known to affect both the\nstructure of a network and the dynamics of the processes supported thereon,\nincluding the resilience to damage, the spread of information and epidemics,\nand the efficiency of defence mechanisms. Nonetheless, while many studies focus\non undirected scale-free networks, the interactions in real-world systems often\nhave a directionality. Here, we investigate the dependence of the degree\ncorrelations on the power-law exponents in directed scale-free networks. To\nperform our study, we consider the problem of building directed networks with a\nprescribed degree distribution, providing a method for proper generation of\npower-law-distributed directed degree sequences. Applying this new method, we\nperform extensive numerical simulations, generating ensembles of directed\nscale-free networks with exponents between~2 and~3, and measuring ensemble\naverages of the Pearson correlation coefficients. Our results show that\nscale-free networks are on average uncorrelated across directed links for three\nof the four possible degree-degree correlations, namely in-degree to in-degree,\nin-degree to out-degree, and out-degree to out-degree. However, they exhibit\nanticorrelation between the number of outgoing connections and the number of\nincoming ones. The findings are consistent with an entropic origin for the\nobserved disassortativity in biological and technological networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 12:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Firstly, there is a\nvery broad and strong flux drop below 8000 AA (4000 AA in the rest frame),\nwhich seems to be variable between the two spectroscopic epochs.

We interpret the unusual properties of these\nspectra as reflecting the presence of three distinct regions along the\nline-of-sight: the excited He i absorption originates from an H ii-region,\nwhereas the Balmer absorption must originate from an associated\nphotodissociation region. The strong metal line and molecular absorption and\nthe dust extinction must originate from a third, cooler region along the\nline-of-sight.

The main goal is to verify whether the dynamical friction time\n(t_DF) develops a non-monotonic radial-dependence that could explain the\nbimodality of the Blue Straggler radial distributions observed in globular\nclusters. In these systems, in fact, relaxation effects lead to a mass and\nvelocity radial segregation of the different mass components, so that\nmass-spectrum effects on t_DF are expected to be dependent on radius. We find\nthat, in spite of the presence of different masses, t_DF is always a monotonic\nfunction of radius, at all evolutionary times and independently of the initial\nconcentration of the simulated cluster. This because the radial dependence of\nt_DF is largely dominated by the total mass density profile of the background\nstars (which is monotonically decreasing with radius). Hence, a progressive\ntemporal erosion of the BSS population at larger and larger distances from the\ncluster center remains the simplest and the most likely explanation of the\nshape of the observed BSS radial distributions, as suggested in previous works.\nWe also confirm the theoretical expectation that approximating a multi-mass\nglobular cluster as made of (averaged) equal-mass stars can lead to significant\noverestimates of t_DF within the half-mass radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 13:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Although many methods have been proposed for image\nauto-annotation, the question of how to determine the number of tags to be\nselected per image remains open. The main challenge is that for a large tag\nvocabulary, there is often a lack of ground truth data for acquiring optimal\ncutoff thresholds per tag. In contrast to previous works that pre-specify the\nnumber of tags to be selected, we propose in this paper adaptive tag selection.\nThe key insight is to divide the vocabulary into two disjoint subsets, namely a\nseen set consisting of tags having ground truth available for optimizing their\nthresholds and a novel set consisting of tags without any ground truth. Such a\ndivision allows us to estimate how many tags shall be selected from the novel\nset according to the tags that have been selected from the seen set. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method is justified by our participation in the\nImageCLEF 2014 image annotation task. On a set of 2,065 test images with ground\ntruth available for 207 tags, the benchmark evaluation shows that compared to\nthe popular top-$k$ strategy which obtains an F-score of 0.122, adaptive tag\nselection achieves a higher F-score of 0.223.

Filter or\nwrapper methods for features reduction cannot be applied to our dataset: the\napplication of these algorithms can only be performed on datasets without\nmissing data. Instead, we applied Topological data analysis (TDA) to overcome\nthe hurdle of processing datasets with null values missing data. A topological\nnetwork was developed using the Iris software (Ayasdi, Inc., Palo Alto). The PE\npatient topology identified two ares in the pathological group and hence two\ndistinct clusters of PE patient populations. Additionally, the topological\nnetowrk detected several sub-groups among healthy patients that likely are\naffected with non-PE diseases. TDA was further utilized to identify key\nfeatures which are best associated as diagnostic factors for PE and used this\ninformation to define the input space for a back-propagation artificial neural\nnetwork (BP-ANN). It is shown that the area under curve (AUC) of BP-ANN is\ngreater than the AUCs of the scores (Wells and revised Geneva) used among\nphysicians. The results demonstrate topological data analysis and the BP-ANN,\nwhen used in combination, can produce better predictive models than Wells or\nrevised Geneva scores system for the analyzed cohort\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 15:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-18"}

However, putting graph analytics on the cloud can invade users'\nprivacy. To solve this problem, we propose CryptGraph, which runs graph\nanalytics on encrypted graph to preserve the privacy of both users' graph data\nand the analytic results. In CryptGraph, users encrypt their graphs before\nuploading them to the cloud. The cloud runs graph analysis on the encrypted\ngraphs and obtains results which are also in encrypted form that the cloud\ncannot decipher. During the process of computing, the encrypted graphs are\nnever decrypted on the cloud side. The encrypted results are sent back to users\nand users perform the decryption to obtain the plaintext results. In this\nprocess, users' graphs and the analytics results are both encrypted and the\ncloud knows neither of them. Thereby, users' privacy can be strongly protected.\nMeanwhile, with the help of homomorphic encryption, the results analyzed from\nthe encrypted graphs are guaranteed to be correct. In this paper, we present\nhow to encrypt a graph using homomorphic encryption and how to query the\nstructure of an encrypted graph by computing polynomials. To solve the problem\nthat certain operations are not executable on encrypted graphs, we propose hard\ncomputation outsourcing to seek help from users. Using two graph algorithms as\nexamples, we show how to apply our methods to perform analytics on encrypted\ngraphs.

Here we report a detailed photon\nenergy dependent study of the cd-ARPES spectra in BiTeX (X = I, Br and Cl).

Social networks\nalso exhibit dynamic nature as these networks change continuously with the\npassage of time. Social networks might also present a hierarchical structure\nled by individuals that play important roles in a society such as Managers and\nDecision Makers. Detection and Visualization of these networks changing over\ntime is a challenging problem where communities change as a function of events\ntaking place in the society and the role people play in it.\n  In this paper we address these issues by presenting a system to analyze\ndynamic social networks. The proposed system is based on dynamic graph\ndiscretization and graph clustering. The system allows detection of major\nstructural changes taking place in social communities over time and reveals\nhierarchies by identifying influential people in a social networks. We use two\ndifferent data sets for the empirical evaluation and observe that our system\nhelps to discover interesting facts about the social and hierarchical\nstructures present in these social networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 15:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-18"}

This is termed an \"epistemic restriction\" because it implies a\nfundamental limit on the amount of knowledge that any observer can have about\nthe physical state of a classical system. This article provides an overview of\nepistricted theories, that is, theories that start from a classical statistical\ntheory and apply an epistemic restriction. We consider both continuous and\ndiscrete degrees of freedom, and show that a particular epistemic restriction\ncalled classical complementarity provides the beginning of a unification of all\nknown epistricted theories. This restriction appeals to the symplectic\nstructure of the underlying classical theory and consequently can be applied to\nan arbitrary classical degree of freedom. As such, it can be considered as a\nkind of quasi-quantization scheme; \"quasi\" because it generally only yields a\ntheory describing a subset of the preparations, transformations and\nmeasurements allowed in the full quantum theory for that degree of freedom, and\nbecause in some cases, such as for binary variables, it yields a theory that is\na distortion of such a subset. Finally, we propose to classify quantum\nphenomena as weakly or strongly nonclassical by whether or not they can arise\nin an epistricted theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 15:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}

In this paper we consider the general\nsetting of a piecewise affine program; that is a program performing different\naffine updates on the system depending on some conditions. This typically\nencompasses linear controllers with saturations or controllers with different\nbehaviors and performances activated on some safety conditions. Our analysis is\ninspired by works performed a decade ago by Johansson et al, and Morari et al,\nin the control community.
