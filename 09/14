The key idea is to analyze\nthe change in the recognition scores when artificially masking out different\nregions of the image. The masking out of a region that includes the object\ntypically causes a significant drop in recognition score. This idea is embedded\ninto an agglomerative clustering technique that generates self-taught\nlocalization hypotheses. Our object localization scheme outperforms existing\nproposal methods in both precision and recall for small number of subwindow\nproposals (e.g., on ILSVRC-2012 it produces a relative gain of 23.4% over the\nstate-of-the-art for top-1 hypothesis).

A\nrecoiling supermassive black hole (SBH) can subsequently undergo long-lived\noscillations in the potential well of its host galaxy, suggesting that offset\nSBHs may be common in the cores of massive ellipticals. We have analyzed HST\narchival images of 14 nearby core ellipticals, finding evidence for small\n($\\lesssim 10$ pc) displacements between the AGN (locating the SBH) and the\ncenter of the galaxy (the mean photocenter) in 10 of them. Excluding objects\nthat may be affected by large-scale isophotal asymmetries, we consider six\ngalaxies to have detected displacements, including M87, where a displacement\nwas previously reported by Batcheldor et al. 2010. In individual objects, these\ndisplacements can be attributed to residual gravitational recoil oscillations\nfollowing a major or minor merger within the last few Gyr. For plausible merger\nrates, however, there is a high probability of larger displacements than those\nobserved, if SBH coalescence took place in these galaxies. Remarkably, the\nAGN-photocenter displacements are approximately aligned with the radio source\naxis in four of the six galaxies with displacements, including three of the\nfour having relatively powerful kpc-scale jets. This suggests intrinsic\nasymmetries in radio jet power as a possible displacement mechanism, although\napproximate alignments are also expected for gravitational recoil. Orbital\nmotion in SBH binaries and interactions with massive perturbers can produce the\nobserved displacement amplitudes but do not offer a ready explanation for the\nalignments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Sep 2014 17:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-27"}

In fact, to the best of our knowledge, it\nis not based on any prevalent and convincing economic theories. In this paper,\nwe incorporate Rawls' principle of fair equality of opportunity into\nArrow-Debreu's framework of general equilibrium theory with heterogeneous\nagents, and derive the alarming level of Gini coefficient formally. Our theory\nreveals that the exponential distribution of income not only satisfies Pareto\noptimality, but also obeys social fairness in Rawls' sense. Therefore, we\nspecify the maximal value of the Gini coefficient when income follows\nexponential distribution as a possible alarming level.

Produced in hard scattering processes in the initial\nstages of the collision, they interact with the medium, lose energy and,\ndepending on the coupling strength to the medium, take part in the collective\nmotion of the QCD matter. ALICE measured the production of ${\\rm D^{0}}$, ${\\rm\nD^{*+}}$, ${\\rm D^{+}}$ and ${\\rm D_{s}}$ mesons at central rapidity in pp,\np-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. The study of the modification of the\ntransverse momentum differential yields of charm particles in Pb-Pb collisions\nwith respect to pp collisions, quantified by the nuclear modification factor\n($R_{\\rm AA}$), can unravel details of the energy loss mechanism, such as its\ndependence on the quark mass and on the path length the parton travels through\nthe medium. A similar comparison between pp and p-Pb collision data ($R_{\\rm\npPb}$) is fundamental to disentangle effects related to the presence of the hot\nmedium from cold nuclear matter effects. The degree of thermalization and\ncoupling to the medium is investigated in semi-peripheral Pb-Pb collisions by\nmeasuring the elliptic flow coefficient ($v_{2}$) at low pt. At high pt,\n$v_{2}$ is sensitive to the path-length dependence of the energy loss.

In fact, such arrangements are\nhighly desirable for large facilities---such as stadiums, universities, and\nmines---as they already need to cover property costs, and often have fibre\nbackhaul and efficient power infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a new\nnetwork sharing arrangement between large facilities and traditional operators.\nOur facility network sharing arrangement consists of two aspects: leasing of\ncore network access and spectrum from traditional operators; and service\nagreements with users. Importantly, our incorporation of a user service\nagreement into the arrangement means that resource allocation must account for\nfinancial as well as physical resource constraints. This introduces a new\nnon-trivial dimension into wireless network resource allocation, which requires\na new evaluation framework---the data rate is no longer the only main\nperformance metric. Moreover, despite clear economic incentives to adopt\nnetwork sharing for facilities, a business case is lacking. As such, we develop\na general socio-technical evaluation framework based on ruin-theory, where the\nkey metric for the sharing arrangement is the probability that the facility has\nless than zero revenue surplus. We then use our framework to evaluate our\nfacility network sharing arrangement, which offers guidance for leasing and\nservice agreement negotiations, as well as design of the wireless network\narchitecture, taking into account network revenue streams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Sep 2014 08:48:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 16:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-26"}

GJ 436b is one of the few transiting warm Neptunes for which a\ndetailed characterisation of the atmosphere is possible, whereas its\nnon-negligible orbital eccentricity calls for further investigation.\nIndependent analyses of several individual datasets obtained with Spitzer have\nled to contradicting results attributed to the different techniques used to\ntreat the instrumental effects. Aims. We aim at investigating these previous\ncontroversial results and developing our knowledge of the system based on the\nfull Spitzer photometry dataset combined with new Doppler measurements obtained\nwith the HARPS spectrograph. We also want to search for additional planets.\nMethods. We optimise aperture photometry techniques and the photometric\ndeconvolution algorithm DECPHOT to improve the data reduction of the Spitzer\nphotometry spanning wavelengths from 3-24 {\\mu}m. Adding the high precision\nHARPS radial velocity data, we undertake a Bayesian global analysis of the\nsystem considering both instrumental and stellar effects on the flux variation.\nResults. We present a refined radius estimate of RP=4.10 +/- 0.16 R_Earth, mass\nMP=25.4 +/- 2.1 M_Earth and eccentricity e= 0.162 +/- 0.004 for GJ 436b.

Using this condition, Maurer and Wolf showed a remarkable \"all\nor nothing\" result: if the simulatability condition does not hold, the key\ncapacity over the non-authenticated public channel will be the same as that of\nthe case with a passive Eve, while the key capacity over the non-authenticated\nchannel will be zero if the simulatability condition holds. However, two\nquestions remain open so far: 1) For a given joint probability mass function\n(PMF), are there efficient algorithms (polynomial complexity algorithms) for\nchecking whether the simulatability condition holds or not?; and 2) If the\nsimulatability condition holds, are there efficient algorithms for finding the\ncorresponding attack strategy?

There are still a large\nnumber of outstanding questions, such the reason for the asymmetric radio\nmorphology, the structure of the pre-supernova environment, and the efficiency\nof particle acceleration at the supernova shock. We explore these questions\nusing three-dimensional simulations of the expanding remnant between days 820\nand 10,000 after the supernova. We combine a hydrodynamical simulation with\nsemi-analytic treatments of diffusive shock acceleration and magnetic field\namplification to derive radio emission as part of an inverse problem.\nSimulations show that an asymmetric explosion, combined with magnetic field\namplification at the expanding shock, is able to replicate the persistent\none-sided radio morphology of the remnant. We use an asymmetric Truelove &\nMcKee progenitor with an envelope mass of $10 M_{\\sun}$ and an energy of $1.5\n\\times 10^{44} J$.

LBNO considers three types of neutrino\ndetector technologies: a double-phase liquid argon (LAr) TPC and a magnetised\niron detector as far detectors. For the near detector, a high-pressure gas TPC\nembedded in a calorimeter and a magnet is the baseline design. A mandatory\nmilestone is a concrete prototyping effort towards the envisioned large-scale\ndetectors, and an accompanying campaign of measurements aimed at assessing the\ndetector associated systematic errors. The proposed $6\\times 6\\times 6$m$^3$\nDLAr is an industrial prototype of the design discussed in the EoI and scalable\nto 20 kton or 50~kton. It is to be constructed and operated in a controlled\nlaboratory and surface environment with test beam access, such as the CERN\nNorth Area (NA). Its successful operation and full characterisation will be a\nfundamental milestone, likely opening the path to an underground deployment of\nlarger detectors. The response of the DLAr demonstrator will be measured and\nunderstood with an unprecedented precision in a charged particle test beam\n(0.5-20 GeV/c). The exposure will certify the assumptions and calibrate the\nresponse of the detector, and allow to develop and to benchmark sophisticated\nreconstruction algorithms, such as those of 3-dimensional tracking, particle ID\nand energy flow in liquid argon. All these steps are fundamental for validating\nthe correctness of the physics performance described in the LBNO EoI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Sep 2014 12:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-17"}

It is also noted that\nthe main theorem is proved without usual demiclosedness condition. Also, under\nthe appropriate assumptions on the control sequences and operators, our\niterative method can be reduced to recent methods.

If\nwe speak about a generall data compression, it has to be a lossless one. It\nmeans, we are able to recover the original data 1:1 from the compressed file.\nMultimedia data (images, video, sound...), are a special case. In this area, we\ncan use something called a lossy compression. Our main goal is not to recover\ndata 1:1, but only keep them visually similar. This article is about an image\ncompression, so we will be interested only in image compression. For a human\neye, it is not a huge difference, if we recover RGB color with values\n[150,140,138] instead of original [151,140,137]. The magnitude of a difference\ndetermines the loss rate of the compression. The bigger difference usually\nmeans a smaller file, but also worse image quality and noticable differences\nfrom the original image. We want to cover compression techniques mainly from\nthe last decade. Many of them are variations of existing ones, only some of\nthem uses new principes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Sep 2014 11:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-10"}
