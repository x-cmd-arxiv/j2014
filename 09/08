At one extreme, there is a trivial\n$2$-approximation for this problem that uses only $O(\\log n)$ space, namely,\ncount the number of edges and output half of this value as the estimate for max\ncut value. On the other extreme, if one allows $\\tilde{O}(n)$ space, then a\nnear-optimal solution to the max cut value can be obtained by storing an\n$\\tilde{O}(n)$-size sparsifier that essentially preserves the max cut. An\nintriguing question is if poly-logarithmic space suffices to obtain a\nnon-trivial approximation to the max-cut value (that is, beating the factor\n$2$). It was recently shown that the problem of estimating the size of a\nmaximum matching in a graph admits a non-trivial approximation in\npoly-logarithmic space.\n  Our main result is that any streaming algorithm that breaks the\n$2$-approximation barrier requires $\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{n})$ space even if the\nedges of the input graph are presented in random order.

The goal is to match vertices of $V_2$ as they arrive to\nvertices in $V_1$, so as to maximize the sum of weights of edges in the\nmatching. If assignments to $V_1$ cannot be changed, no bounded competitive\nratio is achievable. We study the weighted online matching problem with {\\em\nfree disposal}, where vertices in $V_1$ can be assigned multiple times, but\nonly get credit for the maximum weight edge assigned to them over the course of\nthe algorithm. For this problem, the greedy algorithm is $0.5$-competitive and\ndetermining whether a better competitive ratio is achievable is a well known\nopen problem.\n  We identify an interesting special case where the edge weights are\ndecomposable as the product of two factors, one corresponding to each end point\nof the edge. This is analogous to the well studied related machines model in\nthe scheduling literature, although the objective functions are different. For\nthis case of decomposable edge weights, we design a 0.5664 competitive\nrandomized algorithm in complete bipartite graphs. We show that such instances\nwith decomposable weights are non-trivial by establishing upper bounds of 0.618\nfor deterministic and $0.8$ for randomized algorithms.\n  A tight competitive ratio of $1-1/e \\approx 0.632$ was known previously for\nboth the 0-1 case as well as the case where edge weights depend on the offline\nvertices only, but for these cases, reassignments cannot change the quality of\nthe solution. Beating 0.5 for weighted matching where reassignments are\nnecessary has been a significant challenge. We thus give the first online\nalgorithm with competitive ratio strictly better than 0.5 for a non-trivial\ncase of weighted matching with free disposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Sep 2014 17:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-09"}

Unlike the standard approaches (Schrodinger-Heisenberg,\nFeynman, Wigner-Gronewald-Moyal), the process approach is not merely equivalent\nto NRQM and is not merely a re-interpretation. The process approach provides a\ndynamical completion of NRQM. Standard NRQM arises as a asymptotic quotient by\nmeans of a set-valued process covering map, which links the process algebra to\nthe usual space of wave functions and operators on Hilbert space. The process\napproach offers an emergentist, discrete, finite, quasi-non-local and\nquasi-non-contextual realist interpretation which appears to resolve many of\nthe paradoxes and is free of divergences. Nevertheless, it retains the\ncomputational power of NRQM and possesses an emergent probability structure\nwhich agrees with NRQM in the asymptotic quotient.

Our work unifies and\nextends a long list of results by many authors. We make it a point to avoid any\nassumption of properness/compactness, keeping in mind the motivating example of\n$\\mathbb H^\\infty$, the infinite-dimensional rank-one symmetric space of\nnoncompact type over the reals. The monograph provides a number of examples of\ngroups acting on $\\mathbb H^\\infty$ which exhibit a wide range of phenomena not\nto be found in the finite-dimensional theory. Such examples often demonstrate\nthe optimality of our theorems. We introduce a modification of the Poincar\\'e\nexponent, an invariant of a group which gives more information than the usual\nPoincar\\'e exponent, which we then use to vastly generalize the Bishop--Jones\ntheorem relating the Hausdorff dimension of the radial limit set to the\nPoincar\\'e exponent of the underlying semigroup. We give some examples based on\nour results which illustrate the connection between Hausdorff dimension and\nvarious notions of discreteness which show up in non-proper settings. We\nconstruct Patterson--Sullivan measures for groups of divergence type without\nany compactness assumption. This is carried out by first constructing such\nmeasures on the Samuel--Smirnov compactification of the bordification of the\nunderlying hyperbolic space, and then showing that the measures are supported\non the bordification. We study quasiconformal measures of geometrically finite\ngroups in terms of (a) doubling and (b) exact dimensionality.

Small or no directional\ndependence of the spectra is found for small-scale B. After about 200 days,\npersistent broad-line, flat-topped or stumpy profiles require high density\nburning which is the signature of a WD close to M_Ch. Narrow peaked profiles\nare a signature of chemical mixing or sub-MCh WDs.

Recently, there\nhas been a lot of renewed interest in these systems with the discovery of\nmaterials such as Volborthite and Herbertsmithite that have Kagome like\nstructures. In the presence of an external magnetic field, these frustrated\nsystems can give rise to magnetization plateaus of which the plateau at\n$m=\\frac{1}{3}$ is considered to be the most prominent. Here we study the\nproblem of the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 quantum XXZ Heisenberg model on a\nKagome lattice by using a Jordan-Wigner transformation that maps the spins onto\na problem of fermions coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. This mapping\nrelies on being able to define a consistent Chern-Simons term on the lattice.\nUsing a recently developed method to rigorously extend the Chern-Simons term to\nthe frustrated Kagome lattice we can now formalize the Jordan-Wigner\ntransformation on the Kagome lattice. We then discuss the possible phases that\ncan arise at the mean-field level from this mapping and focus specifically on\nthe case of $\\frac{1}{3}$-filling ($m=\\frac{1}{3}$ plateau) and analyze the\neffects of fluctuations in our theory. We show that in the regime of $XY$\nanisotropy the ground state at the $1/3$ plateau is equivalent to a bosonic\nfractional quantum Hall Laughlin state with filling fraction $1/2$ and that at\nthe $5/9$ plateau it is equivalent to the first bosonic Jain daughter state at\nfilling fraction $2/3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Sep 2014 22:04:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Oct 2014 22:42:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-09"}

For this purpose we first formulate the\n$a_{0}(980)$-$f_{0}(980)$ mixing intensity as the ratio of two partial decay\nwidths of a parent particle, in the same manner as the recent analysis in BES\nexperiments. Calculating the $a_{0}(980)$-$f_{0}(980)$ mixing intensity with\nthe existing Flatte parameters from experiments, we find that many combinations\nof the $a_{0}(980)$ and $f_{0}(980)$ Flatte parameters can reproduce the\nexperimental value of the $a_{0}(980)$-$f_{0}(980)$ mixing intensity by BES.\nNext, from the same Flatte parameters we also calculate the $K \\bar{K}$\ncompositeness for $a_{0}(980)$ and $f_{0}(980)$. Although the compositeness\nwith the correct normalization becomes complex in general for resonance states,\nwe find that the Flatte parameters for $f_{0}(980)$ imply large absolute value\nof the $K \\bar{K}$ compositeness and the parameters for $a_{0}(980)$ lead to\nsmall but nonnegligible absolute value of the $K \\bar{K}$ compositeness.

Moreover, the experimental value of the\n$a_{0}(980)$-$f_{0}(980)$ mixing intensity implies that the $a_{0}(980)$ and\n$f_{0}(980)$ resonances cannot be simultaneously $K \\bar{K}$ molecular states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 05:47:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Nov 2014 07:35:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 08:54:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 01:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

Such an\ninstrument relies on an extreme adaptive optics system coupled with a\ncoronagraph that suppresses most of the diffracted stellar light. However, the\ncoronagraph performance is strongly limited by quasi-static aberrations that\ncreate long-lived speckles in the scientific image plane, which can easily be\nmistaken for planets. The ultimate performance is thus limited by the\nunavoidable differential aberrations between the wave-front sensor and the\nscientific camera, which have to be estimated andcompensated for. In this\npaper, we use the COFFEE approach to measure and compensate for SPHERE's\nquasi-static aberrations. COFFEE (for COronagraphic Focal-plane wave-Front\nEstimation for Exoplanet detection), which consists in an extension of phase\ndiversity to coronagraphic imaging, estimates the quasi-static aberrations,\nincluding the differential ones, using only two focal plane images recorded by\nthe scientific camera. In this paper, we use coronagraphic images recorded from\nSPHERE's infrared detector IRDIS to estimate the aberrations upstream of the\ncoronagraph, which are then compensated for using SPHERE's extreme adaptive\noptics loop SAXO. We first validate the ability of COFFEE to estimate\nhigh-order aberrations by estimating a calibrated influence function pattern\nintroduced upstream of the coronagraph. We then use COFFEE in an original\niterative compensation process to compensate for the estimated aberrations,\nleading to a contrast improvement by a factor that varies from 1.4 to 4.7\nbetween 2l/D and 15l/D on IRDIS. The performance of the compensation process is\nalso evaluated through simulations. An excellent match between experimental\nresults and these simulations is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 08:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Therefore,\nobservation of any of these mesons ($M^0$) decaying into an invisible final\nstate would signal the presence of new physics. The Bell-Steinberger relation\nconnects CP and CPT violation in the mass matrix to CP and CPT violation in all\ndecay channels of neutral kaons. It is a powerful tool for testing CPT\ninvariance in the $K^0-\\overline{K}^0$ system, assuming that there are no\nsignificant undiscovered decay modes of either $K_S$ or $K_L$ which could\ncontribute to the precision of the results. The $K_S,K_L\\to invisible$ decays\nhave never been tested and the question of how much these decays can influence\nthe Bell-Steinberger analysis of the kaon system still remains open. In the\npresent work we propose a new experiment to search for the $M^0\\to invisible$\ndecays which aims at probing new physics and answering this question. The\nexperiment utilizes high energy hadronic beams from the CERN SPS and the charge\nexchange reactions of pion or kaon on nucleons of an active target, e.g. $\\pi^-\n(K^-) + p\\to M^0 + n $, as a source of the well-tagged $M^0$s emitted with the\nbeam energy. If the decay $M^0\\to invisible$ exists, it could be observed by\nlooking for an excess of events with a specific signature: the complete\ndisappearance of the beam energy in the detector.

The overall scaled mutation rate is parametrized\nwith $\\theta=(\\mu_1+\\mu_0)N$ and the ratio of mutation rates with\n$\\alpha=\\mu_1/(\\mu_1+\\mu_0)=1-\\beta$. The equilibrium density of this process\nis beta with parameters $\\alpha\\theta$ and $\\beta\\theta$. Away from\nequilibrium, the transition density can be expanded into a series of modified\nJacobi polynomials. If the scaled mutation rates are small, i.e., $\\theta \\ll\n1$, it may be assumed that polymorphism derives from mutations at the\nboundaries. A model, where the interior dynamics conform to the pure drift\ndiffusion model and the mutations are entering from the boundaries is derived.\nIn equilibrium, the density of the proportion of polymorphic alleles, \\ie\\ $x$\nwithin the polymorphic region $[1/N,1-1/N]$, is\n$\\alpha\\beta\\theta(\\tfrac1x+\\tfrac1{1-x})=\\tfrac{\\alpha\\beta\\theta}{x(1-x)}$,\nwhile the mutation bias $\\alpha$ influences the proportion of monomorphic\nalleles at 0 and 1. Analogous to the expansion with modified Jacobi\npolynomials, a series expansion of the transition density is derived, which is\nconnected to Kimura's well known solution of the pure drift model using\nGegenbauer polynomials. Two temporal and two spatial regions are separated. The\neigenvectors representing the spatial component within the polymorphic region\ndepend neither on the on the scaled mutation rate $\\theta$ nor on the mutation\nbias $\\alpha$. Therefore parameter changes, e.g., growing or shrinking\npopulations or changes in the mutation bias, can be modeled relatively easily,\nwithout the change of the eigenfunctions necessary for the series expansion\nwith Jacobi polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 11:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-09"}

However, there are many deep\nopen questions that come with the theory of fluid mechanics. In this paper, we\ndiscuss some of them that we classify in two categories, the long term behavior\nof solutions of equations of hydrodynamics and the definition of initial\n(boundary) conditions. The first set of questions come with the\nnon-relativistic theory based on the Navier-Stokes equations. Starting from\nsmooth initial conditions, the purpose is to understand if solutions of\nNavier-Stokes equations remain smooth with the time evolution. Existence for\njust a finite time would imply the evolution of finite time singularities,\nwhich would have a major influence on the development of turbulent phenomena.\nThe second set of questions come with the relativistic theory of hydrodynamics.\nThere is an accumulating evidence that this theory may be relevant for the\ndescription of the medium created in high energy heavy-ion collisions.

This behavior is\nfound in QDs with different shapes, heights, crystallographic orientations and\nexternal fields. The origin of these angles can be traced back to the\nsymmetries of the spin admixing terms of the Hamiltonian. In [001] grown QDs,\nthe suppression angles are different for Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit\nterms.

Such phenomenon was expressed by the minimum volume\nfraction of amphiphile required to form microemulsion, which was the analytical\nsignal of the method. The performed studies were: phase behavior, droplet\ndimension by dynamic light scattering, analytical curve, and robustness tests.\nThe reliability of the method was evaluated by determining water in ethanol\nfuels and monoethylene glycol in complex samples of liquefied natural gas. The\ndispersions were composed of water-chlorobenzene (water analysis) and\nwater-oleic acid (monoethylene glycol analysis) with ethanol as the hydrotrope\nphase.

Thus, managing their changes is an important\nchallenge for system maintainability. Existing approaches to model differencing\nconcentrate on heuristics matching between model elements and on finding and\npresenting differences at a concrete or abstract syntactic level. While showing\nsome success, these approaches are inherently limited to comparing syntactic\nstructures. This paper is a manifesto for research on semantic model\ndifferencing. We present our vision to develop semantic diff operators for\nmodel comparisons: operators whose input consists of two models and whose\noutput is a set of diff witnesses, instances of one model that are not\ninstances of the other.

With the widespread of\nmobile devices and location-based services, social media typically allows users\nto share whereabouts of daily activities (e.g., check-ins and taking photos),\nand thus strengthens the roles of social media as a proxy to understand human\nbehaviors and complex social dynamics in geographic spaces. Unlike conventional\nspatiotemporal data, this new modality of data is dynamic, massive, and\ntypically represented in stream of unstructured media (e.g., texts and photos),\nwhich pose fundamental representation, modeling and computational challenges to\nconventional spatiotemporal analysis and geographic information science. In\nthis paper, we describe a scalable computational framework to harness massive\nlocation-based social media data for efficient and systematic spatiotemporal\ndata analysis. Within this framework, the concept of space-time trajectories\n(or paths) is applied to represent activity profiles of social media users. A\nhierarchical spatiotemporal data model, namely a spatiotemporal data cube\nmodel, is developed based on collections of space-time trajectories to\nrepresent the collective dynamics of social media users across aggregation\nboundaries at multiple spatiotemporal scales. The framework is implemented\nbased upon a public data stream of Twitter feeds posted on the continent of\nNorth America. To demonstrate the advantages and performance of this framework,\nan interactive flow mapping interface (including both single-source and\nmultiple-source flow mapping) is developed to allow real-time, and interactive\nvisual exploration of movement dynamics in massive location-based social media\nat multiple scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 03:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-17"}
