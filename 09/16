Membrane channels in cells are useful\nmodels for artificial designs because of their high efficiency, selectivity and\nrobustness to external fluctuations. Here we model the passive channels that\nlet cargo simply diffuse through them, affected by a potential profile along\nthe way. Passive transporters achieve high levels of efficiency and specificity\nfrom binding interactions with the cargo inside the channel. This however leads\nto a paradox: why should channels which are so narrow that they are blocked by\ntheir cargo evolve to have binding regions for their cargo if that will\neffectively block them? Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we show that\ndifferent potentials, notably symmetric, increase the flux through narrow\npassive channels -- and investigate how shape and depth of potentials influence\nthe flux. We find that there exist optimal depths for certain potential shapes\nand that it is most efficient to apply a small force over an extended region of\nthe channel. On the other hand, having several spatially discrete binding\npockets will not alter the flux significantly. We also explore the role of\nmany-particle effects arising from pairwise particle interactions with their\nneighbours and demonstrate that the relative changes in flux can be accounted\nfor by the kinetics of the absorption reaction at the end of the channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 16:35:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-26"}

We calculate the structural relaxation and magnetic moment\nof each cluster by using ab initio spin-polarized density functional theory\n(DFT), and the MCA with both spin-polarized DFT (including spin-orbit coupling\nself-consistently) and the torque method. We find that the MCA of any composite\nstructure of a given size is enhanced with respect to that of the same-sized\npure Pt or pure Fe cluster as well as to that of any pair of Fe and Pt atoms in\nbulk L10 FePt. This enhancement results from the hybridization we observe\nbetween the 3d orbital of the Fe atoms and the 5d orbital of their Pt\nneighbors. This hybridization, however, affects the electronic properties of\nthe component atoms in significantly different ways. While it somewhat\nincreases the spin moment of the Fe atoms, it has little effect on their\norbital moment; at the same time, it greatly increases both the spin and\norbital moment of the Pt atoms. Given the fact that the spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC) constant of Pt is about 7 times greater than that of Fe, this Fe-induced\njump in the orbital moment of the Pt atoms produces the increase in MCA of the\ncomposite structures over that of their pure counterparts. That any composite\nstructure exhibits higher MCA than bulk L10 FePt results from the lower\ncoordination of Pt atoms in the cluster, whether Fe or Pt predominates within\nit. We also find that bipyramidal clusters whose central layer is Pt have\nhigher MCA than their same-sized counterparts whose central layer is Fe. This\nresults from the fact that Pt atoms in such configurations are coordinated with\nmore Fe atoms than in the latter. By thus participating in more instances of\nhybridization, they contribute higher orbital moments to the overall MCA of the\nunit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 16:45:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 16:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 14:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

It is based on the\nCourant-Fischer min-max principle adapted to our case. % The theorem we present\nsupports the new trend in geometry processing of treating geometric structures\nby using their projection onto the leading eigenfunctions of the decomposition\nof the LBO. Utilisation of this result can be used for constructing numerically\nefficient algorithms to process shapes in their spectrum. We review a couple of\napplications as possible practical usage cases of the proposed optimality\ncriteria. % We refer to a scale invariant metric, which is also invariant to\nbending of the manifold.

We demonstrate\nthe efficiency of an intermediate metric, defined as an interpolation between\nthe scale invariant and the regular one, in representing geometric structures\nwhile capturing both coarse and fine details. Next, we review a numerical\nacceleration technique for classical scaling, a member of a family of\nflattening methods known as multidimensional scaling (MDS). There, the\noptimality is exploited to efficiently approximate all geodesic distances\nbetween pairs of points on a given surface, and thereby match and compare\nbetween almost isometric surfaces. Finally, we revisit the classical principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) definition by coupling its variational form with a\nDirichlet energy on the data manifold. By pairing the PCA with the LBO we can\nhandle cases that go beyond the scope defined by the observation set that is\nhandled by regular PCA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 17:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}

First introduced by Goulden and Jackson\n(1996) these numbers indexed by three partitions of a given integer $n$ and the\nJack parameter $\\alpha$ are defined as the coefficients in the power sum\nexpansion of the Cauchy sum for Jack symmetric functions. While very little is\nknown about them, examples of computations for small values of $n$ tend to show\nthat the nice properties of the special cases $\\alpha =1$ (connection\ncoefficients of the class algebra) and $\\alpha = 2$ (connection coefficients of\nthe double coset algebra) extend to general $\\alpha$. Goulden and Jackson\nconjectured that Jack connection coefficients are polynomials in $\\beta =\n\\alpha-1$ with non negative integer coefficients given by some statistics on\nmatchings on a set of $2n$ elements, the so called Matchings-Jack conjecture.\nIn this paper we look at the case when two of the integer partitions are equal\nto the single part $(n)$ and use a framework by Lasalle (2008) for Jack\nsymmetric functions to show that the coefficients satisfy a simple recurrence\nformula that makes their computation very effective and allow a better\nunderstanding of their properties. In particular we prove the Matchings-Jack\nconjecture in this case. Furthermore, we provide a bijective proof of the\nrecurrence formula for $\\alpha \\in \\{1,2\\}$ using the combinatorial\ninterpretation of the coefficients for these specific values of the Jack\nparameter.

This,\nin turn, leads to a redistribution of all electrons in the host, and, if\ndesigned properly, changes the location of the Fermi level EF and the density\nof conducting charge carriers near EF. The principle is proven experimentally\nin elemental Bi, whereby group III elements In and Ga dope Bi p-type, in spite\nof the fact that all three atoms are trivalent in the solid state. Electronic\nstructure calculations show the formation of a hyperdeep defect state (HDS) and\nits effect on the EF in Bi doped with In (Bi:In) and Ga (Bi:Ga). The HDS at -5\nto -6 eV below the EF of elemental Bi hybridizes with the Bi 6p electrons, and\ndeprives the Bi valence band of two electrons per impurity atom. This then\nperturbs the electron count in the solid and lowers the EF. The charge on the\nimpurity atoms is unchanged. In principle, this doping action does not result\nin the appearance of ionized impurities that scatter conduction electrons and\nholes in conventional doping. Experimentally, Shubnikov - de Haas and Hall\nEffect measurements show that adding In to Bi results in an increase in the\ndensity of holes. Thermoelectric, galvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic data are\ngiven for single-crystal and polycrystalline samples. In-doping leads to an\nenhancement of the thermoelectric figure of merit, which suggests that the new\ndoping mechanism also gives a route to develop better thermoelectric materials.\nThe same mechanism is at work for Sn-doped Bi (Bi:Sn), although here ionized\nimpurity scattering is not avoided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 18:11:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 08:17:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 May 2015 10:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-04"}

Since transition\nprobabilities are intractable for most processes of interest yet forward\nsimulation is straightforward, Bayesian inference typically proceeds through\ncomputationally intensive methods such as (particle) MCMC. Such methods\nostensibly require the ability to simulate trajectories from the conditioned\njump process. When observations are highly informative, use of the forward\nsimulator is likely to be inefficient and may even preclude an exact\n(simulation based) analysis. We therefore propose three methods for improving\nthe efficiency of simulating conditioned jump processes. A conditioned hazard\nis derived based on an approximation to the jump process, and used to generate\nend-point conditioned trajectories for use inside an importance sampling\nalgorithm. We also adapt a recently proposed sequential Monte Carlo scheme to\nour problem. Essentially, trajectories are reweighted at a set of intermediate\ntime points, with more weight assigned to trajectories that are consistent with\nthe next observation. We consider two implementations of this approach, based\non two continuous approximations of the MJP. We compare these constructs for a\nsimple tractable jump process before using them to perform inference for a\nLotka-Volterra system. The best performing construct is used to infer the\nparameters governing a simple model of motility regulation in Bacillus\nsubtilis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 18:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}

Two general approaches to addressing the\njoint problem are a simultaneous approach, where all parameters are optimized\nat the same time, or a sequential approach, where a distinction between\nplacement and control parameters is maintained by separating the optimization\nproblem into two (or more) stages, some of which consider only a subset of the\ntotal number of variables.

From a comparison of the HR\ndiagram with PMS evolutionary models we derive ages and masses of the PMS\nstars.

If a polytope P has symmetry, we can consider equivariant psd\nlifts, i.e. those psd lifts that respect the symmetry of P. One of the simplest\nfamilies of polytopes with interesting symmetries are regular polygons in the\nplane, which have played an important role in the study of linear programming\nlifts (or extended formulations). In this paper we study equivariant psd lifts\nof regular polygons. We first show that the standard Lasserre/sum-of-squares\nhierarchy for the regular N-gon requires exactly ceil(N/4) iterations and thus\nyields an equivariant psd lift of size linear in N. In contrast we show that\none can construct an equivariant psd lift of the regular 2^n-gon of size 2n-1,\nwhich is exponentially smaller than the psd lift of the sum-of-squares\nhierarchy. Our construction relies on finding a sparse sum-of-squares\ncertificate for the facet-defining inequalities of the regular 2^n-gon, i.e.,\none that only uses a small (logarithmic) number of monomials. Since any\nequivariant LP lift of the regular 2^n-gon must have size 2^n, this gives the\nfirst example of a polytope with an exponential gap between sizes of\nequivariant LP lifts and equivariant psd lifts. Finally we prove that our\nconstruction is essentially optimal by showing that any equivariant psd lift of\nthe regular N-gon must have size at least logarithmic in N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 18:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-19"}

Whereas their stellar masses $M_*$ have a\nrather narrow distribution, the population of GRBs is very diverse, with\ngamma-ray luminosities $L_\\gamma$ spanning several orders of magnitude. This\nsuggests the existence of a \"hidden\" stellar variable whose burst-to-burst\nvariation leads to a spread in $L_\\gamma$. Whatever this hidden variable is,\nits variation should not noticeably affect the shape of GRB lightcurves, which\ndisplay a constant luminosity (in a time-average sense) followed by a sharp\ndrop at the end of the burst seen with Swift/XRT. We argue that such a hidden\nvariable is progenitor star's large-scale magnetic flux. Shortly after the core\ncollapse, most of stellar magnetic flux accumulates near the black hole (BH)\nand remains there. The flux extracts BH rotational energy and powers jets of\nroughly a constant luminosity, $L_j$. However, once BH mass accretion rate\n$\\dot M$ falls below $\\sim L_j/c^2$, the flux becomes dynamically important and\ndiffuses outwards, with the jet luminosity set by the rapidly declining mass\naccretion rate, $L_j\\sim \\dot M c^2$. This provides a potential explanation for\nthe sharp end of GRBs and the universal shape of their lightcurves. During the\nGRB, gas infall translates spatial variation of stellar magnetic flux into\ntemporal variation of $L_j$. We make use of the deviations from constancy in\n$L_j$ to perform stellar magnetic flux \"tomography\".

This is highly relevant for understanding the growth of\ncosmological halos, and could especially provide an explanation for some high\nvelocity objects. The model we present includes a \\emph{double scattering\nmechanism}, where a halo particle is given a significant energy kick by\nundergoing two subsequent gravitational deflections during the merger. The\nfirst deflection is by the potential of the target halo, whereas the second is\nby the potential of the particle's original host halo. The resultant energy\nkick arises because the two halos move relative to each other during the two\ndeflections. To our knowledge, this mechanism has never been characterized in\nthis context before. We derive analytically a halo particle's total kick\nenergy, which is composed of energy from the double scattering mechanism and\nenergy release from tidal fields, as a function of its position in its original\nhost halo. In the case of a $1:10$ merger between two Hernquist halos, we\nestimate that the presented mechanisms can generate particles with a velocity\n$\\sim 2$ times the virial velocity of the target halo measured at its virial\nsphere. This motivates us to suggest that the high velocity of the recently\ndiscovered globular cluster HVCG-1 \\citep{2014ApJ...787L..11C} can be explained\nby a head-on halo merger. Finally, we illustrate the orbital evolution of\nparticles outside the virial sphere of the target halo, by solving the equation\nof motion in an expanding universe. We find a 'sweet spot' around a scale\nfactor of $0.3-0.5$ for ejecting particles into large orbits, which easily can\nreach beyond $\\sim 5$ virial radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 20:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The asymmetry will appear as amplitude and phase modulations at the\norbital frequency. For strongly precessing systems, it accounts for at least 3%\namplitude modulation for binaries in the sensitivity band of ground-based\ngravitational-wave detectors, and can exceed 50% for massive systems. Such\nasymmetric features are also clearly visible when the waves are decomposed into\nmodes of spin-weighted spherical harmonics, and are inherent in the waves\nthemselves---rather than resulting from residual eccentricity in numerical\nsimulations, or from mode-mixing due to precession.

Using near-IR integral-field\nspectroscopy obtained with VLT/SINFONI, we detect a kpc-scale structure of\nhigh-velocity molecular hydrogen (H2) gas associated with the deeply buried\nsecondary nucleus of the IR-luminous merger NGC3256. We show that this\nstructure is likely the hot component of a molecular outflow, which is detected\nalso in the cold molecular gas by Sakamoto et al. This outflow, with a\nmolecular gas mass of M(H2)~2x10^7 Msun, is among the first to be spatially\nresolved in both the hot H2 gas with VLT/SINFONI and the cold CO-emitting gas\nwith ALMA. The hot and cold components share a similar morphology and\nkinematics, with a hot-to-cold molecular gas mass ratio of ~6x10^-5. The high\n(~100 pc) resolution at which we map the geometry and velocity structure of the\nhot outflow reveals a biconical morphology with opening angle ~40 deg and gas\nspread across a FWZI~1200 km/s. Because this collimated outflow is oriented\nclose to the plane of the sky, the molecular gas may reach maximum intrinsic\noutflow velocities of ~1800 km/s, with an average mass outflow rate of at least\n~20 Msun/yr. By modeling the line-ratios of various near-IR H2 transitions, we\nshow that the H2 gas in the outflow is heated through shocks or X-rays to a\ntemperature of ~1900K. The energy needed to drive the outflow is likely\nprovided by a hidden Compton-thick AGN or by the nuclear starburst. We show\nthat the global kinematics of the molecular outflow in NGC3256 mimic those of\nCO-outflows that have been observed at low spatial resolution in starburst- and\nactive galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 23:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

In this paper, we reexamine the effect of\nJovian resonances and take into account the secular resonance in the asteroid\nbelt caused by the gravity of the gas disk. We find that the velocities\nrelative to the gas disk of planetesimals a few hundred kilometers in size\nexceed 12 km/s, and that this is achieved around the 3:1 mean-motion resonance.\nThe heating region is restricted to a relatively narrow band between 1.5 AU and\n3.5 AU. Our results suggest that chondrules were produced effectively in the\nasteroid region after Jovian formation. We also find that many planetesimals\nare scattered far beyond Neptune. Our findings can explain the presence of\ncrystalline silicate in comets if the scattered planetesimals include silicate\ndust processed by shock heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 02:32:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

With the appearance of CS, we solve a mixed\nboundary value problem to get the magnetospheric field based on a domain\ndecomposition method. We investigate properties of the equilibrium curve of the\nflux rope when the CS is present in background multipolar fields. In response\nto the variations at the magnetar surface, it quasi-statically evolves in\nstable equilibrium states. The loss of equilibrium occurs at a critical point\nand, beyond that point, it erupts catastrophically. New features show up when\nthe CS is considered. Especially, we find two kinds of physical behaviors,\ni.e., catastrophic state transition and catastrophic escape. Magnetic energy\nwould be released during state transitions. The released magnetic energy is\nsufficient to drive giant flares. The flux rope would go away from the magnetar\nquasi-statically, which is inconsistent with the radio afterglow. Fortunately,\nin the latter case, i.e., the catastrophic escape, the flux rope could escape\nthe magnetar and go to infinity in a dynamical way. This is more consistent\nwith radio afterglow observations of giant flares. We find that the minor\nradius of flux rope has important implications for its eruption. Flux ropes\nwith larger minor radius are more prone to erupt. We stress that the CS\nprovides an ideal place for magnetic reconnection, which would further enhance\nthe energy release during eruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 02:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In the first, a centralized\nsystem with full channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT) is\nassumed, and the communication parameters like transmit power and data-rate are\njointly chosen for every fading vector realization. On the other hand, in\nfast-fading links with distributed CSIT, the lack of full CSI is compensated by\nperforming ergodic averaging over sufficiently many channel realizations.\nNotice that the distributed CSI may necessitate decentralized power-control for\noptimal data-transfer. Apart from these two models, the case of slow-fading\nlinks and distributed CSIT, though relevant to many systems, has received much\nless attention.\n  In this paper, a block-fading AWGN MAC with full CSI at the receiver and\ndistributed CSI at the transmitters is considered. The links undergo\nindependent fading, but otherwise have arbitrary fading distributions. The\nchannel statistics and respective long-term average transmit powers are known\nto all parties. We first consider the case where each encoder has knowledge\nonly of its own link quality, and not of others. For this model, we compute the\nadaptive capacity region, i.e. the collection of average rate-tuples under\nblock-wise coding/decoding such that the rate-tuple for every fading\nrealization is inside the instantaneous MAC capacity region. The key step in\nour solution is an optimal rate allocation function for any given set of\ndistributed power control laws at the transmitters. This also allows us to\ncharacterize the optimal power control for a wide class of fading models.\nFurther extensions are also proposed to account for more general CSI\navailability at the transmitters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 02:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-17"}

The dust emission at 150 GHz\nobserved by BICEP2 should be less in magnitude but have similar structure to\nthat at 353 GHz. We have therefore calculated and mapped the B-modes in the\nBICEP2 region from the publicly available Q and U 353 GHz preliminary Planck\npolarization maps.

At the heart of these methods\nis the solution of an eigenvalue equation in the space of single-orbital\ntransitions, whose quickly increasing number makes such calculations costly if\nnot infeasible for larger molecules. This is especially true for time-dependent\ndensity functional tight binding (TD-DFTB), where the evaluation of the matrix\nelements is inexpensive. For the relatively large systems that can be studied\nthe solution of the eigenvalue equation therefore determines the cost of the\ncalculation.

The integrated spectrum\nof umbral oscillations contains distinct narrowband peaks at 1.9 min, 2.3 min,\nand 2.8 min. The power significantly varies in time, forming distinct\noscillation trains. The oscillation power distribution over the sunspot in the\nhorizontal plane reveals that the enhancements of the oscillation amplitude, or\nwave fronts, have a distinct structure consisting of an evolving two-armed\nspiral and a stationary circular patch at the spiral origin, situated near the\numbra centre. This structure is seen from the temperature minimum to the\ncorona. In time, the spiral rotates anti-clockwise. The wave front spirality is\nmost pronounced during the maximum amplitude phases of the oscillations. In the\nlow-amplitude phases the spiral breaks into arc-shaped patches. The 2D\ncross-correlation function shows that the oscillations at higher atmospheric\nlevels occur later than at lower layers. The phase speed is estimated to be\nabout 100 km/s. The fine spectral analysis shows that the central patch\ncorresponds to the high-frequency oscillations, while the spiral arms highlight\nthe lower-frequency oscillations in the 3-min band. The vertical and horizontal\nradial structure of the oscillations is consistent with the model that\ninterprets umbral oscillations as slow magnetoacoustic waves filtered by the\natmospheric temperature non-uniformity in the presence of the magnetic field\ninclination from the vertical. The mechanism for the polar-angle structure of\nthe oscillations, in particular the spirality of the wave fronts, needs to be\nrevealed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 07:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-17"}

Using our\nopen-source grid-adaptive MPI-AMRVAC software, we revisit the planar evolution\ncase in compressible MHD, as well as its extension to 2.5D and full 3D\nscenarios. As long as the third dimension remains ignorable, pure tilt\nevolutions result which are hardly affected by out of plane magnetic field\ncomponents.

In the bistable regimes\nswitches between the coexisting attractors can be induced by noise. When we\ncouple larger sets of these units, we numerically observe collective coherent\nmodes of individual fixed-point and limit-cycle behavior. It is there the\nmonotonic change of a single bifurcation parameter that allows to control the\nonset and arrest of the synchronized oscillations. This mechanism may play a\nrole in biological applications, in particular in connection with the\nsegmentation clock. While tuning the bifurcation parameter, also a variety of\ntransient patterns emerges upon approaching the stationary states, in\nparticular a self-organized pacemaker in a completely uniformly equipped\nensemble, so that the symmetry breaking happens dynamically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 09:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

A\ndefinite example, chosen for its relevance in light of current experiments in\ngraphene nanostructures, is the optimization of the experimental parameters\nthat generate a prescribed spatial profile of pseudomagnetic fields in\ngraphene. But the method is general enough to accommodate a multitude of\npossible experimental parameters and conditions whereby deformations can be\nimparted to the graphene lattice, and complies, by design, with graphene's\nelastic equilibrium and elastic compatibility constraints. As a result, it\nefficiently answers the inverse problem of determining the optimal values of a\nset of external or control parameters that result in a graphene deformation\nwhose associated pseudomagnetic field profile best matches a prescribed target.\nThe ability to address this inverse problem in an expedited way is one key step\nfor practical implementations of the concept of two-dimensional systems with\nelectronic properties strain-engineered to order.

Therefore, in continuation of our experiments on mutual\ndecimeter collisions, we investigate collisions of centimeter onto decimeter\ndust agglomerates in a small drop tower under vacuum conditions (p<5*$10^{-1}$\nmbar) at a mean collision velocity of 6.68 +- 0.67m/s. We use quartz dust with\nirregularly shaped micrometer grains.

At lower collision energies only the projectile gets\ndestroyed and mass is transferred to the target. The accretion efficiency\ndecreases with increasing obliquity and increasing difference in filling\nfactor, if the projectile is more compact than the target. The accretion\nefficiency increases with increasing collision energy for collision energies\nunder a certain threshold. Beyond this threshold at 298+-25 mJ catastrophic\ndisruption of the target can be observed. This corresponds to a critical\nfragmentation strength Q*=190+-16 mJ/kg, which is a factor of four larger than\nexpected. Analyses of the projectile fragments show a power law size\ndistribution with average exponent of -3.8+-0.3. The mass distributions suggest\nthat the fraction of smallest fragments increases for higher collision\nenergies.

However, the efficacy of these interventions, and their likely impact\non an Ebola epidemic of this size, is unknown. Forecasting and simulation of\nthese interventions may inform public health efforts. We use existing data from\nLiberia and Sierra Leone to parameterize a mathematical model of Ebola and use\nthis model to forecast the progression of the epidemic, as well as the efficacy\nof several interventions, including increased contact tracing, improved\ninfection control practices, the use of a hypothetical pharmaceutical\nintervention to improve survival in hospitalized patients. Model forecasts\nuntil Dec. 31, 2014 show an increasingly severe epidemic with no sign of having\nreached a peak. Modeling results suggest that increased contact tracing,\nimproved infection control, or a combination of the two can have a substantial\nimpact on the number of Ebola cases, but these interventions are not sufficient\nto halt the progress of the epidemic. The hypothetical pharmaceutical\nintervention, while impacting mortality, had a smaller effect on the forecasted\ntrajectory of the epidemic. Near-term, practical interventions to address the\nongoing Ebola epidemic may have a beneficial impact on public health, but they\nwill not result in the immediate halting, or even obvious slowing of the\nepidemic.

An assurance case is a structured\nargument, often represented with a graphical interface, that presents and\nsupports claims about a system's behavior. The argument may combine different\nkinds of evidence to justify its top level claim. While assurance cases deliver\nsome level of guarantee of a system's correctness, they lack the rigor that\nproofs from formal methods typically provide. Furthermore, changes in the\nstructure of a model during development may result in inconsistencies between a\ndesign and its assurance case. Our solution is a framework for automatically\ngenerating assurance cases based on 1) a system model specified in an\narchitectural design language, 2) a set of logical rules expressed in a domain\nspecific language that we have developed, and 3) the results of other formal\nanalyses that have been run on the model.

Recent\nexperiments with ultracold atomic gases have reached the interaction strength\nfor which theoretical models have predicted the occurrence of the\nnormal-to-itinerant-ferromagnetic phase transition, but so far this transition\nhas not been observed. The instability of the repulsive branch of the Feshbach\nresonance prevents the formation of the itinerant ferromagnetic state, but it\nis not clear whether this is the only instability impeding its experimental\nrealization. In this article, we use the path-integral formalism with density\nfields in the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to study the stability of a\nhomogeneous two-component Fermi gas with contact interactions. Within the\nsaddle-point approximation we show that none of the extrema of the action are\nminima, meaning all extrema are unstable to small density fluctuations. This\nimplies a more general mechanical instability of the polarized (itinerant\nferromagnetic) and normal states of the system in the path-integral formalism.\nWe find that it is important to consider the stability of the system when\nstudying itinerant ferromagnetism. Since (mechanical) stability may be\ninfluenced by the details of the interaction potential, we suggest the use of a\nmore realistic potential than the contact potential in future theoretical\ndescriptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 13:25:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2015 10:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-08"}

Links of weights w1 and w0\noccur with probabilities p and 1-p, respectively. The fraction of infected\nnodes rho(p) shows a non-monotonic behavior, with rho drops with p for small p\nand increases for large p. For small to moderate w1/w0 ratios, rho(p) exhibits\na minimum that signifies an optimal suppression. For large w1/w0 ratios, the\nsuppression leads to an absorbing phase consisting only of healthy nodes within\na range p_L =< p =< p_R, and an active phase with mixed infected and healthy\nnodes for p < p_L and p>p_R. A mean field theory that ignores spatial\ncorrelation is shown to give qualitative agreement and capture all the key\nfeatures. A physical picture that emphasizes the intricate interplay between\ninfections via w0 links and within clusters formed by nodes carrying the w1\nlinks is presented. The absorbing state at large w1/w0 ratios results when the\nclusters are big enough to disrupt the spread via w0 links and yet small enough\nto avoid an epidemic within the clusters. A theory that uses the possible local\nenvironments of a node as variables is formulated. The theory gives results in\ngood agreement with simulation results, thereby showing the necessity of\nincluding longer spatial correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 13:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

For a plane gravitational wave this scale is\ngiven by its wavelength which defines the domain of validity for these\ncoordinates known as the long-wavelength regime. The symmetry of this\nspacetime, however, allows us to extend Fermi normal coordinates far beyond the\nlong-wavelength regime. Here we present an explicit construction for this\nlong-range Fermi normal coordinate system based on the unique solution of the\nboundary-value problem for spacelike geodesics. The resulting formulae amount\nto summation of the infinite series for Fermi normal coordinates previously\nobtained with perturbation expansions. We also consider two closely related\nnormal coordinate systems: optical coordinates which are built from null\ngeodesics and wave-synchronous coordinates which are built from spacelike\ngeodesics locked in phase with the propagating gravitational wave. The\nwave-synchronous coordinates yield the exact solution of Peres and Ehlers-Kundt\nwhich is globally defined. In this case, the limitation of the long-wavelength\nregime is completely overcome, and the system of wave-synchronous coordinates\nbecomes valid for arbitrarily large distances. Comparison of the different\ncoordinate systems is done by considering the motion of an inertial test mass\nin the field of a plane gravitational wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 14:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Our aim is to survey far-infrared molecular line emission\nfrom a uniform and significant sample of deeply-embedded low-mass young stellar\nobjects in order to characterize shocks and the possible role of ultraviolet\nradiation in the immediate protostellar environment. Herschel/PACS spectral\nmaps of 22 objects in the Perseus molecular cloud were obtained as part of the\n`William Herschel Line Legacy' survey. Line emission from H$_\\mathrm{2}$O, CO,\nand OH is tested against shock models from the literature.\n  Observed line ratios are remarkably similar and do not show variations with\nsource physical parameters. Observations show good agreement with the shock\nmodels when line ratios of the same species are compared. Ratios of various\nH$_\\mathrm{2}$O lines provide a particularly good diagnostic of pre-shock gas\ndensities, $n_\\mathrm{H}\\sim10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, in agreement with typical\ndensities obtained from observations of the post-shock gas. The corresponding\nshock velocities, obtained from comparison with CO line ratios, are above 20\nkm\\,s$^{-1}$. However, the observations consistently show one-to-two orders of\nmagnitude lower H$_\\mathrm{2}$O-to-CO and H$_\\mathrm{2}$O-to-OH line ratios\nthan predicted by the existing shock models.\n  The overestimated model H$_\\mathrm{2}$O fluxes are most likely caused by an\noverabundance of H$_\\mathrm{2}$O in the models since the excitation is\nwell-reproduced. Illumination of the shocked material by ultraviolet photons\nproduced either in the star-disk system or, more locally, in the shock, would\ndecrease the H$_\\mathrm{2}$O abundances and reconcile the models with\nobservations. Detections of hot H$_\\mathrm{2}$O and strong OH lines support\nthis scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 14:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

The atomic hydrogen is generated by a hot filament, and the doping\nprocess takes place at moderate temperature (373 K). Undoped VO2 has a\nmetal-to-insulator phase transition at ~340 K between a high-temperature,\nrutile, metallic phase and a low-temperature, monoclinic, insulating phase with\na resistance exhibiting a semiconductor-like temperature dependence. Atomic\nhydrogenation results in stabilization of the metallic phase of VO2\nmicro/nanobeams down to 2 K, the lowest point we could reach in our measurement\nsetup. Based on observing the movement of the hydrogen diffusion front in\nsingle crystalline VO2 beams, we estimate the diffusion constant for hydrogen\nalong the c-axis of the rutile phase to be 6.7 x 10^{-10} cm^2/s at\napproximately 373 K, exceeding the value in isostructural TiO2 by ~ 38x.\nMoreover, we find that the diffusion constant along the c-axis of the rutile\nphase exceeds that along the equivalent a-axis of the monoclinic phase by at\nleast three orders of magnitude. This remarkable change in kinetics must\noriginate from the distortion of the \"channels\" when the unit cell doubles\nalong this direction upon cooling into the monoclinic structure.

Both\nphenomena may signify shock waves driven by CMEs. Taking EUV full-disk images\nat an unprecedented cadence, the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory has observed the so-called EIT waves or large-scale\ncoronal propagating fronts (LCPFs) from their early evolution, which coincides\nwith the period when most metric type II bursts occur. This article discusses\nthe relation of LCPFs as captured by AIA with metric type II bursts. We show\nexamples of type II bursts without a clear LCPF and fast LCPFs without a type\nII burst. Part of the disconnect between the two phenomena may be due to the\ndifficulty in identifying them objectively. Furthermore, it is possible that\nthe individual LCPFs and type II bursts may reflect different physical\nprocesses and external factors. In particular, the type II bursts that start at\nlow frequencies and high altitudes tend to accompany an extended arc- shaped\nfeature, which probably represents the 3D structure of the CME and the shock\nwave around it, rather than its near-surface track, which has usually been\nidentified with EIT waves. This feature expands and propagates toward and\nbeyond the limb. These events may be characterized by stretching of field lines\nin the radial direction, and be distinct from other LCPFs, which may be\nexplained in terms of sudden lateral expansion of the coronal volume. Neither\nLCPFs nor type II bursts by themselves serve as necessary conditions for\ncoronal shock waves, but these phenomena may provide useful information on the\nearly evolution of the shock waves in 3D when both are clearly identified in\neruptive events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 03:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

One of\nthe mysteries is the existence of binary planetesimals with near-equal mass\ncomponents and highly eccentric orbits. These binary planetesimals are quite\ndifferent from the satellites observed in the asteroid belt region. The ratio\nof the Hill radius to the physical radius of the planetesimals is much larger\nfor the outer region of the disk, compared to the inner region of the disk. The\nHill radius increases with the semi major axis. Therefore, planetesimals in the\nouter region can form close and eccentric binaries, while those in the inner\nregion would simply collide. In this paper, we carried out $N$-body simulations\nin different regions of the disk and studied if binaries form in the outer\nregion of the disk. We found that large planetesimals tend to form binaries. A\nsignificant fraction of large planetesimals are components of the binaries.\nPlanetesimals that become the components of binaries eventually collide with a\nthird body, through three-body encounters.

We consider a theory where a primordial\nflux noise field left over in unchanged form from an early inflationary or\nquantum gravity epoch of the universe intrinsically influences the phase\ndifference in SQUIDs and qubits. The perturbation seeds generated by this field\ncan explain in a quantitatively correct way the form and amplitude of measured\nlow-frequency flux noise spectra in SQUID devices if one takes as a source of\nfluctuations the primordial power spectrum of curvature fluctuations as\nmeasured by the Planck collaboration. Our model predicts flux noise with a\nspectrum given by an $1/f^{2-n_s}$ spectrum, where $n_s=0.96$ is the spectral\nindex of the near-scale invariant primordial density fluctuations.

This remains unsatisfactory with respect to the unity of nature and to\nthe necessary number of postulates. We uncover the intrinsic connection of\nthese areas of physics and describe them using a common symplectic Hamiltonian\nformalism. Our approach is based on a proper distinction between variables and\nconstants, i.e. on a basic but rigorous ontology of time. We link these concept\nwith the obvious conditions for the possibility of measurements. The derived\nconsequences put the measurement problem of quantum mechanics and the\nCopenhagen interpretation of the quantum mechanical wavefunction into\nperspective. According to our (onto-) logic we find that spacetime can not be\nfundamental. We argue that a geometric interpretation of symplectic dynamics\nemerges from the isomorphism between the corresponding Lie algebra and the\nrepresentation of a Clifford algebra. Within this conceptional framework we\nderive the dimensionality of spacetime, the form of Lorentz transformations and\nof the Lorentz force and fundamental laws of physics as the Planck-Einstein\nrelation, the Maxwell equations and finally the Dirac equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 15:25:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 10:59:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 07:27:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 Feb 2015 12:38:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 11:01:34 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 13:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}
