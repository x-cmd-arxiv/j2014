I argue that exact equations require calibrated multiscale analysis to\ndeal with ions. Exact theories in biochemistry must use mathematics of\ninteractions because biological ionic solutions, derived from seawater, are\ncomplex (not simple) fluids. The activity of one ion depends on every other\nion. Mathematics of conservative interactions is well understood but friction\nis another matter. Mathematicians now have now an energetic variational\ncalculus dealing with friction. Complex fluids need variational methods because\neverything interacts with everything else. Mathematics designed to handle\ninteractions is needed to produce exact equations. If interactions are not\naddressed with variational mathematics, they are bewildering. The mathematics\nmust include the global properties of the electric field. Flow of charge in one\nplace changes the flow everywhere by Kirchoff and Maxwell laws. Charge changes\nphysical nature as it flows through a circuit. It is ions in salt water; it is\nelectrons in a vacuum tube; it is quasi-particles in a semiconductor; and it is\nnothing much in a vacuum capacitor (i.e., displacement current). Charge is\nabstract. The physical nature of charge and current is strikingly diverse; yet,\nthe flow of current is exactly the same in every element in a series circuit.\nThe global nature of electric flow prevents the law of mass action from being\nexact. The law of mass action (with rate constants that are constant) does not\nknow about charge. The law of mass action is about mass conservation.

Eight radio source\nsamples are combined to produce a catalogue of 211 radio-loud AGN with\n0.5<z<1.0, which are spectroscopically classified into jet-mode and\nradiative-mode (radiatively-efficient) AGN classes. Comparing with large\nsamples of local radio-AGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the cosmic\nevolution of the radio luminosity function of each radio-AGN class is\nindependently derived. Radiative-mode radio-AGN show an order of magnitude\nincrease in space density out to z~1 at all luminosities, consistent with these\nAGN being fuelled by cold gas. In contrast, the space density of jet-mode\nradio-AGN decreases with increasing redshift at low radio luminosities (L_1.4 <\n1e24 W/Hz) but increases at higher radio luminosities. Simple models are\ndeveloped to explain the observed evolution. In the best-fitting models, the\ncharacteristic space density of jet-mode AGN declines with redshift in\naccordance with the declining space density of massive quiescent galaxies,\nwhich fuel them via cooling of gas in their hot haloes. A time delay of 1.5-2\nGyr may be present between the quenching of star formation and the onset of\njet-mode radio-AGN activity. The behaviour at higher radio luminosities can be\nexplained either by an increasing characteristic luminosity of jet-mode\nradio-AGN activity with redshift (roughly as (1+z) cubed) or if the jet-mode\nradio-AGN population also includes some contribution of cold-gas-fuelled\nsources seen at a time when their accretion rate was low. Higher redshifts\nmeasurements would distinguish between these possibilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Aug 2014 20:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Bayesian\ninference methods based on expectation-maximization (EM) have been proposed to\novercome these limitations, but are often computationally demanding since the\nE-step in the EM procedure typically involves state estimation for a\nhigh-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. In this work, we propose a\ncomputationally fast method for the state estimation based on a hybrid of loopy\nbelief propagation and approximate message passing (AMP). The key insight is\nthat a neural system as viewed through calcium imaging can be factorized into\nsimple scalar dynamical systems for each neuron with linear interconnections\nbetween the neurons. Using the structure, the updates in the proposed hybrid\nAMP methodology can be computed by a set of one-dimensional state estimation\nprocedures and linear transforms with the connectivity matrix. This yields a\ncomputationally scalable method for inferring connectivity of large neural\ncircuits. Simulations of the method on realistic neural networks demonstrate\ngood accuracy with computation times that are potentially significantly faster\nthan current approaches based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2014 04:30:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 21:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

For\nclusters of total mass $M_{500} >$ $\\sim 10^{14}$ $M_{\\odot}$ nice agreement is\nfound between their iron content and what expected from empirical supernova\nyields. For the same clusters, there also appears to be at least as much iron\nin the intracluster medium (ICM) as there is still locked into stars (i.e., the\nICM/stars metal share is about unity). However, for more massive clusters the\nstellar mass fraction appears to drop substantially without being accompanied\nby a drop in the ICM metallicity, thus generating a major tension with the\nnucleosynthesis expectation and inflating the metal share to extremely high\nvalues (up to $\\sim 6$).

We implement the T--tau relations from PHOENIX BT-Settl\nmodel atmospheres as the outer boundary conditions in the PARSEC code, finding\nthat this change alone reduces the discrepancy in the mass--radius relation\nfrom 8 to 5 per cent. We compare the models with multi--band photometry of\nclusters Praesepe and M67, showing that the use of T--tau relations clearly\nimproves the description of the optical colours and magnitudes. But anyway,\nusing both Kurucz and PHOENIX model spectra, model colours are still\nsystematically fainter and bluer than the observations. We then apply a shift\nto the above T--tau relations, increasing from 0 at T_eff = 4730 K to ~14% at\nT_eff = 3160 K, to reproduce the observed mass--radius radius relation of dwarf\nstars. Taking this experiment as a calibration of the T--tau relations, we can\nreproduce the optical and near infrared CMDs of low mass stars in the old\nmetal--poor globular clusters NGC6397 and 47Tuc, and in the intermediate--age\nand young solar--metallicity open clusters M67 and Praesepe.

The important ingredient to the implementation\nof exponential integrators is the efficient and accurate evaluation of the so\ncalled $\\varphi$-functions on a given vector. The Krylov subspace method is an\nimportant technique for this problem. For this type of method, however,\nrestarts become essential for the sake of storage requirements or due to the\ngrowing computational complexity of evaluating the matrix function on a\nHessenberg matrix of growing size. Another problem in computing\n$\\varphi$-functions is the lack of a clear residual notion. The contribution of\nthis work is threefold. First, we introduce a framework of the harmonic Arnoldi\nmethod for $\\varphi$-functions, which is based on the residual and the oblique\nprojection technique. Second, we establish the relationship between the\nharmonic Arnoldi approximation and the classical Arnoldi approximation, and\ncompare the harmonic Arnoldi method with the Arnoldi method from a theoretical\npoint of view. Third, we apply the thick-restarting strategy to the harmonic\nArnoldi method, and propose a thick-restated harmonic Arnoldi algorithm for\nevaluating $\\varphi$-functions. An advantage of the new algorithm is that we\ncan compute several $\\varphi$-functions simultaneously in the same search\nsubspace. We show the merit of augmenting approximate eigenvectors in the\nsearch subspace, and give insight into the relationship between the error and\nthe residual of $\\varphi$-functions. Numerical experiments show the superiority\nof our new algorithm over many state-of-the-art algorithms for the computation\nof $\\varphi$-functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2014 10:03:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-02"}

Understanding the driving mechanism and strength of the stellar\nwinds of AGB stars and the processes enriching their surfaces with products of\nnucleosynthesis are paramount to constraining AGB evolution and predicting the\nchemical evolution of galaxies. In a previous paper we have constrained the\nstructure of the outflowing envelope of W Hya using spectral lines of the\n$^{12}$CO molecule. Here we broaden this study by modelling an extensive set of\nH$_{2}$O and $^{28}$SiO lines observed by the three instruments on board\nHerschel using a state-of-the-art molecular excitation and radiative transfer\ncode. The oxygen isotopic ratios and the $^{28}$SiO abundance profile can be\nconnected to the initial stellar mass and to crucial aspects of dust formation\nat the base of the stellar wind, respectively. The modelling of H$_{2}$O and\n$^{28}$SiO confirms the properties of the envelope model of W Hya derived from\n$^{12}$CO lines. We find an H$_2$O ortho-to-para ratio of\n2.5\\,$^{+2.5}_{-1.0}$, consistent with what is expected for an AGB wind. The\nO$^{16}$/O$^{17}$ ratio indicates that W Hya has an initial mass of about 1.5\nM$_\\odot$. Although the ortho- and para-H$_{2}$O lines observed by HIFI appear\nto trace gas of slightly different physical properties, a turbulence velocity\nof $0.7\\pm0.1$ km s$^{-1}$ fits the HIFI lines of both spin isomers and those\nof $^{28}$SiO well. The ortho- and para-H$_2^{16}$O and $^{28}$SiO abundances\nrelative to H$_{2}$ are $(6^{+3}_{-2}) \\times 10^{-4}$, $(3^{+2}_{-1}) \\times\n10^{-4}$, and $(3.3\\pm 0.8)\\times 10^{-5}$, respectively. Assuming a solar\nsilicon-to-carbon ratio, the $^{28}$SiO line emission model is consistent with\nabout one-third of the silicon atoms being locked up in dust particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2014 12:58:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

Following\nthe Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, we obtain an effective free-energy functional\nin terms of the density field of chiral fermions. The density field of chiral\nfermions is determined by a self-consistent equation, minimizing the effective\nfree-energy functional with respect to the order-parameter field. Beyond these\nthermodynamic properties, we construct Boltzmann transport theory to encode\nboth the Berry curvature and the chiral anomaly in the presence of forward\nscattering of a Fermi-liquid state, essential for understanding dynamic\ncorrelations in interacting Weyl metals. This generalizes the Boltzmann\ntransport theory for the Landau's Fermi-liquid state in the respect of\nincorporating the topological structure and extends that for noninteracting\nWeyl metals in the sense of introducing the forward scattering. Finally, we\njustify this topological Fermi-liquid theory, generalizing the\nfirst-quantization description for noninteracting Weyl metals into the\nsecond-quantization representation for interacting Weyl metals. First, we\nderive a topological Fermi-gas theory, integrating over high-energy electronic\ndegrees of freedom deep inside a pair of chiral Fermi surfaces.

It is argued that the difference in the perception on the\nnature of the problem is the main reason for the persistent disputes. There is\nno decomposition that simultaneously satisfies the twin principles of manifest\nLorentz covariance and gauge invariance, and partial considerations hide likely\ninconsistencies. It is suggested that field equations and matter (i. e.\nelectron in QED and quarks in QCD) equations must be analyzed afresh rather\nthan beginning with the expressions of total angular momentum; canonical or\notherwise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Sep 2014 08:40:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}
