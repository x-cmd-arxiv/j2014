The main difference among them is their\nencoding schemes. For example, ScSPM incorporates Sparse Code (SC) instead of\nVector Quantization (VQ) into the framework of SPM. Although the methods\nachieve a higher recognition rate than the traditional SPM, they consume more\ntime to encode the local descriptors extracted from the image. In this paper,\nwe propose using Low Rank Representation (LRR) to encode the descriptors under\nthe framework of SPM. Different from SC, LRR considers the group effect among\ndata points instead of sparsity. Benefiting from this property, the proposed\nmethod (i.e., LrrSPM) can offer a better performance. To further improve the\ngeneralizability and robustness, we reformulate the rank-minimization problem\nas a truncated projection problem.

In each mixture component, it\nadopts a Gaussian distribution for both the covariates and the responses given\nthe covariates. To robustify the approach with respect to possible elliptical\nheavy tailed departures from normality, due to the presence of atypical\nobservations, the contaminated Gaussian CWM is here introduced. In addition to\nthe parameters of the Gaussian CWM, each mixture component of our contaminated\nCWM has a parameter controlling the proportion of outliers, one controlling the\nproportion of leverage points, one specifying the degree of contamination with\nrespect to the response variables, and one specifying the degree of\ncontamination with respect to the covariates. Crucially, these parameters do\nnot have to be specified a priori, adding flexibility to our approach.\nFurthermore, once the model is estimated and the observations are assigned to\nthe groups, a finer intra-group classification in typical points, outliers,\ngood leverage points, and bad leverage points - concepts of primary importance\nin robust regression analysis - can be directly obtained.

A\npositive integer $d(\\pi)$ is associated with each $\\pi\\in{\\rm{Sym}_n}$ taking\nthe length of the shortest such word, and the $S$-diameter $d(S)$ is the\nmaximum value of $d(\\pi)$ with $\\pi$ ranging over ${\\rm{Sym_n}}$. The distance\n$d(\\pi,\\nu)$ of two permutations $\\pi,\\nu$ defined by $d(\\nu^{-1}\\circ\\pi)$\nsatisfies the axioms of a metric space. In this paper we consider the case\nwhere $S$ consists of all block transpositions of ${\\rm{Sym_n}}$ and call\n$d(\\pi)$ the block transposition distance of $\\pi$. A strong motivation for the\nstudy of this special case comes from investigations of large-scale mutations\nof genome, where determining $d(\\pi)$ is known as sorting the permutation $\\pi$\nby block transpositions. In the papers on this subject, toric equivalence\nclasses often play a crucial role since $d(\\pi)=d(\\nu)$ when $\\pi$ and $\\nu$\nare torically equivalent.

Our main\ncontribution is to obtain a bijective map on ${\\rm{Sym}_n}$ from the toric\nequivalence that leaves the distances invariant. Using the properties of this\nmap, we give an alternative proof of Hausen's result which actually fills a gap\nin the proof of the upper bound on $d(S)$ due to Eriksson and his coworkers;\nsee \\cite{EE}.

In\norder to understand the correlations between centrality metrics and to\napproximate a high-complexity centrality metric by a strongly correlated\nlow-complexity metric, we first study the correlation between centrality\nmetrics in terms of their Pearson correlation coefficient and their similarity\nin ranking of nodes. In addition to considering the widely used centrality\nmetrics, we introduce a new centrality measure, the degree mass. The m order\ndegree mass of a node is the sum of the weighted degree of the node and its\nneighbors no further than m hops away. We find that the B_{n}, the closeness,\nand the components of x_{1} are strongly correlated with the degree, the\n1st-order degree mass and the 2nd-order degree mass, respectively, in both\nnetwork models and real-world networks. We then theoretically prove that the\nPearson correlation coefficient between x_{1} and the 2nd-order degree mass is\nlarger than that between x_{1} and a lower order degree mass. Finally, we\ninvestigate the effect of the inflexible antagonists selected based on\ndifferent centrality metrics in helping one opinion to compete with another in\nthe inflexible antagonists opinion model. Interestingly, we find that selecting\nthe inflexible antagonists based on the leverage, the B_{n}, or the degree is\nmore effective in opinion-competition than using other centrality metrics in\nall types of networks. This observation is supported by our previous\nobservations, i.e., that there is a strong linear correlation between the\ndegree and the B_{n}, as well as a high centrality similarity between the\nleverage and the degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Sep 2014 18:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-04"}

We build on recent findings (Moarref et al., J. Fluid\nMech., 734, 2013) that the velocity fluctuations in the logarithmic region can\nbe decomposed into a weighted sum of geometrically self-similar resolvent\nmodes. The resolvent modes and the weights represent the linear amplification\nmechanisms and the scaling influence of the nonlinear interactions in the\nNavier-Stokes equations (NSE), respectively (McKeon & Sharma, J. Fluid Mech.,\n658, 2010). Originating from the NSE, this framework provides an analytical\nsupport for Townsend's attached-eddy model. Our main result is that\nself-similarity enables order reduction in modeling the logarithmic region by\nestablishing a quantitative link between the self-similar structures and the\nvelocity spectra. Specifically, the energy intensities, the Reynolds stresses,\nand the energy budget are expressed in terms of the resolvent modes with speeds\ncorresponding to the top of the logarithmic region. The weights of the triad\nmodes -the modes that directly interact via the quadratic nonlinearity in the\nNSE- are coupled via the interaction coefficients that depend solely on the\nresolvent modes (McKeon et al., Phys. Fluids, 25, 2013). We use the hierarchies\nof self-similar modes in the logarithmic region to extend the notion of triad\nmodes to triad hierarchies. It is shown that the interaction coefficients for\nthe triad modes that belong to a triad hierarchy follow an exponential\nfunction. The combination of these findings can be used to better understand\nthe dynamics and interaction of flow structures in the logarithmic region. The\ncompatibility of the proposed model with theoretical and experimental results\nis further discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Sep 2014 22:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-23"}

The simulation results for the\nmean-$n$th displacement $M_n(t)$ are then analyzed from the unified point of\nview, where $n$ is an even number. Thus, it is first shown that in each type of\nliquids there exists a master curve $H_n^{(i)}$ as\n$M_n(t)=R^nH_n^{(i)}(v_{th}t/R;D/Rv_{th})$ onto which any simulation results\ncollapse at the same value of $D/Rv_{th}$, where $R$ is a characteristic length\nsuch as an interatomic distance, $D$ a long-time self-diffusion coefficient,\n$v_{th}$ a thermal velocity, and $i=$F and S. The master curves $H_n^{(F)}$ and\n$H_n^{(S)}$ are then shown not to coincide with each other in the so-called\ncage region even at the same value of $D/Rv_{th}$. Thus, it is emphasized that\nthe dynamics of strong liquids is quite different from that of fragile liquids.\nA new type of strong liquids recently proposed is also tested systematically\nfrom this unified point of view. The dynamics of a new type is then shown to be\ndifferent from that of well-known network glass formers in the cage region,\nalthough both liquids are classified as a strong liquid. Thus, it is suggested\nthat a smaller grouping is further needed in strong liquids, depending on\nwhether they have a network or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 00:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-23"}

This article reviews recent progress in\nunderstanding the topological superfluidity of $^3$He in a multifaceted manner,\nincluding symmetry consideration, the Jackiw-Rebbi's index theorem, and the\nquasiclassical theory. Special focus is placed on the symmetry protected\ntopological superfuidity of the $^3$He-B confined in a slab geometry. The\n$^3$He-B under a magnetic field is separated to two different sub-phases: The\nsymmetry protected topological phase and non-topological phase. The former\nphase is characterized by the existence of symmetry protected Majorana\nfermions. The topological phase transition between them is triggered off by the\nspontaneous breaking of a hidden discrete symmetry. The critical field is\nquantitatively determined from the microscopic calculation that takes account\nof magnetic dipole interaction of $^3$He nucleus. It is also demonstrated that\nodd-frequency even-parity Cooper pair amplitudes are emergent in low-lying\nquasiparticles. The key ingredients, symmetry protected Majorana fermions and\nodd-frequency pairing, bring an important consequence that the coupling of the\nsurface states to an applied field is prohibited by the hidden discrete\nsymmetry, while the topological phase transition with the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking is accompanied by anomalous enhancement and anisotropic quantum\ncriticality of surface spin susceptibility. We also illustrate common\ntopological features between topological crystalline superconductors and\nsymmetry protected topological superfluids, taking UPt$_3$ and Rashba\nsuperconductors as examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 07:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

As a first\nstep, we characterize the image of the collective geometric transfer in the\nnon-archimedean case, then reduce the spectral transfer to the case of cuspidal\ntest functions by using a simple stable trace formula. In the archimedean case,\nwe establish the character relations and determine the spectral transfer\nfactors by rephrasing the works by Adams and Renard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 08:19:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 18:08:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2016 04:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

Although\nit is a key player in genome organization by forming bridges between DNA\nduplexes, the precise structure of complexes of DNA and H-NS proteins is still\nnot well understood. In particular, it is not clear whether the structure of\nDNA/H-NS complexes in the living cell is similar to that of complexes deposited\non mica surfaces, which may be observed by AFM microscopy. A coarse-grained\nmodel, which helps getting more insight into this question, is described and\nanalyzed in the present paper. This model is able of describing both the\nbridging of bacterial DNA by H-NS in the bulk and the deposition and\nequilibration of the complex on a charged surface. Simulations performed with\nthe model reveal that a slight attraction between DNA and the charged surface\nis sufficient to let DNA/H-NS complexes reorganize from 3D coils to planar\nplasmids bridged by H-NS proteins similar to those observed by AFM microscopy.\nThey furthermore highlight the antagonistic effects of the interactions between\nDNA and the surface. Indeed, increasing these interactions slows down the\nequilibration of naked plasmids on the surface but, on the other hand, enables\na faster equilibration of DNA/H-NS complexes. Based on the distribution of the\nlifetimes of H-NS bridges and the time evolution of the number of trans-binding\nprotein dimers during equilibration of the complexes on the surface, it is\nargued that the decrease of the equilibration time of the complex upon increase\nof the interaction strength between DNA and the surface is ascribable to the\nassociated decrease of the probability to form new bridges between DNA and the\nproteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 09:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-23"}

Our\ncalculations consider an extended nuclear network, including spontaneous,\n$\\beta$- and neutron-induced fission and adopting fission yield distributions\nfrom the ABLA code. We have studied the sensitivity of the r-process abundances\nto nuclear masses by using different models. Most of the trajectories,\ncorresponding to 90% of the ejected mass, follow a relatively slow expansion\nallowing for all neutrons to be captured. The resulting abundances are very\nsimilar to each other and reproduce the general features of the observed\nr-process abundance (the second and third peaks, the rare-earth peak and the\nlead peak) for all mass models as they are mainly determined by the fission\nyields. We find distinct differences in the abundance yields at and just above\nthe third peak, which can be traced back to different predictions of neutron\nseparation energies for r-process nuclei around neutron number $N=130$. The\nremaining trajectories, which contribute 10% by mass to the total integrated\nabundances, follow such a fast expansion that the r process does not use all\nthe neutrons. This also leads to a larger variation of abundances among\ntrajectories as fission does not dominate the r-process dynamics. The total\nintegrated abundances are dominated by contributions from the slow abundances\nand hence reproduce the general features of the observed r-process abundances.\nWe find that at timescales of weeks relevant for kilonova light curve\ncalculations, the abundance of actinides is larger than the one of lanthanides.\nHence actinides can be even more important than lanthanides to determine the\nphoton opacities under kilonova conditions.

In this\nmanner, one needs to perform only a few detailed experiments to obtain the\nnonequilibrium distribution function for the entire gamut of nonlinearity. We\nachieve this by maximizing the relative entropy functional (MaxRent), which is\nproportional to the Kullback-Leibler distance from a known density function,\nsubject to constraints supplied by the problem definition and new measurements.\nMaxRent is thus superior to the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt), which\nmaximizes Shannon's informational entropy for estimating distributions but\nlacks the ability of incorporating additional prior information. The MaxRent\nprinciple is illustrated using a toy model of $\\phi^4$ thermal conduction\nconsisting of a single lattice point. An external protocol controlled\nposition-dependent temperature field drives the system out of equilibrium. Two\ndifferent thermostatting schemes are employed: the Hoover-Holian deterministic\nthermostat (which produces multifractal dynamics under strong nonlinearity) and\nthe Langevin stochastic thermostat (which produces phase space-filling\ndynamics). Out of the 80 possible states produced by the protocol, we assume\nthat 4 states are known to us in detail, one of which is used as input into\nMaxRent at a time. We find that MaxRent accurately approximates the phase space\ndensity functions at all values of the protocol even when the known\ndistribution is far away.

Each cycle began and ended with a\nsystemic war. During their life span, these cycles show remarkable regularities\nin their dynamics. The accelerated growth of the connectivity of the regulatory\nnetwork of the International System, in combination with its anarchistic\nstructure, produce and shape the war dynamics of the system. The accelerated\ngrowth of the connectivity of the International System is fed by population\ngrowth and the need for social systems to fulfill basic requirements. The\nfinite-time singularity and accompanying log-periodic oscillations were\ninstrumental in the periodic reorganization of the regulatory network of the\nInternational System and contributed to a long-term process of social expansion\nand integration in Europe. The singularity dynamic produced a series of\norganizational innovations. At the critical time of the singularity (1939), the\nconnectivity of the system reached a critical threshold and resulted in a\ncritical transition that led to a fundamental reorganization of the\nInternational System.

It is pointed out that such an approach, unlike Majorana's\n(non-chiral) old one, does not strictly lead, in general, to a true\nself-conjugate particle. This can be seen on directly using the basic\ndefinition (or fundamental representation) of charge conjugation $C$ in Quantum\nField Theory, as an operation just acting on annihilation and creation\noperators and just expressing particle--antiparticle interchange. It is found,\nindeed, that the `active' and `sterile' whole fields which can be obtained from\nmixing the chiral components of two mutually charge-conjugate Dirac fields are\nthemselves `charge conjugate' to each other (rather than individually\nself-conjugate). These fields, taken as mass eigenfields (as in the `Majorana\nmass' case), are shown to describe particles carrying pseudoscalar-type charges\nand being neutral relative to scalar-type charges only. For them, `$CP$\nsymmetry' would be nothing but pure mirror symmetry, and $C$ violation (already\nimplied in their respective `active' and `sterile' behaviors) should then\ninvolve time-reversal violation as well. The new (no longer strictly\nchargeless) `Majorana mass' neutrino model still proves, however, neither to\naffect the usual expectation for a neutrinoless double $\\beta$-decay, nor to\nprevent `active' and `sterile' neutrino varieties from generally taking\ndifferent mass values. One has, on the other hand, that any fermion being just\na genuine (i.e. really self-conjugate) Majorana particle cannot truly exist in\ntwo distinct $-$ `active' and `sterile' $-$ versions, and it can further bear\nonly a unified mass kind which may at once be said to be either a\n`Majorana-like' or a `Dirac-like' mass kind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 13:39:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 15:40:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Feb 2015 12:36:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 11:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-24"}

They perform different analyses over\nthe structure and content of webpages to extract some part of the document.\nHowever, their objective is different. While template detection identifies the\ntemplate of a webpage (usually comparing with other webpages of the same\nwebsite), content extraction identifies the main content of the webpage\ndiscarding the other part. Therefore, they are somehow complementary, because\nthe main content is not part of the template. It has been measured that\ntemplates represent between 40% and 50% of data on the Web.

Without strong technical effort, an OSN may be able to\nexploit the assortativity of human private features, this way constructing\nshadow profiles with information that users chose not to share. Furthermore,\nbecause many users share their phone and email contact lists, this allows an\nOSN to create full shadow profiles for people who do not even have an account\nfor this OSN.\n  We empirically test the feasibility of constructing shadow profiles of sexual\norientation for users and non-users, using data from more than 3 Million\naccounts of a single OSN.

Observations that change the topology,\ni.e., \"manifold collapse,\" require a modification of the abstract model in\norder to construct identifiable statistical models. Often, the essential\ntopological feature is a hierarchical structure of boundaries (faces, edges,\ncorners, etc.) which we represent as a hierarchical graph known as a Hasse\ndiagram.

We also show how in this model, it is possible\nto obtain a significant amount of slow-roll inflation from sub-Planckain\ninitial data, hence circumventing some of the criticisms of standard scenarios.\nThese results show the extent to which a quantum gravity motivated quantization\nmethod affects early universe dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 15:59:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 15:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-11"}

There are currently few engineering methods and tools to deal with\nthem in practice. The purpose of this Dagstuhl Perspectives Workshop on Model\nEngineering for Complex Systems was to study the applicability of Model Driven\nEngineering (MDE) to the development and management of complex systems. MDE is\na software engineering field based on few simple and sound principles. Its\npower stems from the assumption of considering everything - engineering\nartefacts, manipulations of artefacts, etc - as a model. Our intuition was that\nMDE may provide the right level of abstraction to move the study of complex\nsystems from an informal goal to more concrete grounds. In order to provide\nfirst evidence in support of this intuition, the workshop studied different\nvisions and different approaches to the development and management of different\nkinds of complex systems.

We considered a\nstochastic SIR model on dynamical networks that involve local and global\ncontacts among individuals and analyzed the influence of the network properties\non the characterization of the quasi-stationary state. We computed probability\ndensity functions (PDF) for infected fraction of individuals and found that\nthey are well fitted by gamma functions, excepted the tails of the\ndistributions that are q-exponentials. We also computed the fluctuation power\nspectra of infective time series for different networks. We found that network\neffects can be partially absorbed by rescaling the rate of infective contacts\nof the model. An explicit relation between the effective transmission rate of\nthe disease and the correlation of susceptible individuals with their infective\nnearest neighbours was obtained. This relation quantifies the known screening\nof infective individuals observed in these networks. We finally discuss the\ngoodness and limitations of the SIR model with homogeneous mixing and\nparameters taken from epidemiological data to describe the dynamic behaviour\nobserved in the networks studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Sep 2014 18:16:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2015 00:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}

The approximate solutions of these\nequations are obtained using a method based on the extraction of leading\nsingularities of the amplitudes. The poles of the multiquark amplitudes allow\nus to determine the masses of hypernuclei with the atomic (baryon) number\n$A=B=4$.
