The definite process that takes place in the apparatus may\neither be intrinsically random or be explainable from a deeper theory. While\nthe first scenario is the standard lore, the latter implies that quantum\nmechanics is emergent. In that case, it is likely that one has to reconsider\nradiation by accelerated charges as a physical effect, which thus must be\ncompensated by an energy input. Stochastic electrodynamics, for example,\nasserts that the vacuum energy arises from classical fluctuations with energy\n$\\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$ per mode. In such theories the stability of the\nhydrogen ground state will arise from energy input from fluctuations and output\nby radiation, hence due to an energy throughput. That flux of energy\nconstitutes an arrow of time, which we call the \"subquantum arrow of time\". It\nis related to the stability of matter and it is more fundamental than, e.g.,\nthe thermodynamic and cosmological arrows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 16:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Three models of anomalous diffusion\nare considered: fractional diffusion, tempered fractional diffusion, and a\nmodel that combines fractional diffusion and regular diffusion. The reaction\nkinetics corresponds to a Fisher-Kolmogorov nonlinearity. The numerical method\nis based on a finite-difference operator splitting algorithm with an explicit\nEuler step for the time advance of the reaction kinetics, and a Crank-Nicholson\nsemi-implicit time step for the transport operator. The anomalous diffusion\noperators are discretized using an upwind, flux-conserving, Grunwald-Letnikov\nfinite-difference scheme applied to the regularized fractional derivatives.\nWith fractional diffusion of order $\\alpha$, fronts exhibit exponential\nacceleration, $a_L(t) \\sim e^{\\gamma t/\\alpha}$, and develop algebraic decaying\ntails, $\\phi \\sim 1/x^{\\alpha}$. In the case of tempered fractional diffusion,\nthis phenomenology prevails in the intermediate asymptotic regime\n  $\\left(\\chi t \\right)^{1/\\alpha} \\ll x \\ll 1/\\lambda$, where $1/\\lambda$ is\nthe scale of the tempering. Outside this regime, i.e. for $x > 1/\\lambda$, the\ntail exhibits the tempered decay $\\phi \\sim e^{-\\lambda x}/x^{\\alpha+1}$, and\nthe front velocity approaches the terminal speed $v_*=\n\\left(\\gamma-\\lambda^\\alpha \\chi\\right)/ \\lambda$. Of particular interest is\nthe study of the interplay of regular and fractional diffusion. It is shown\nthat the main role of regular diffusion is to delay the onset of front\nacceleration. In particular, the crossover time, $t_c$, to transition to the\naccelerated fractional regime exhibits a logarithmic scaling of the form $t_c\n\\sim \\log \\left(\\chi_d/\\chi_f\\right)$ where $\\chi_d$ and $\\chi_f$ are the\nregular and fractional diffusivities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 16:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-11"}

We showed the true significance of the Maxwell energy\ncriterion load in predicting the sudden onset of 'shock sensitivity' to lateral\ndisturbances. The present paper extends the survey to cover non-integrable\nsystems, such as thin compressed shells. These exhibit spatial chaos,\ngenerating a multiplicity of localized paths (and escape routes) with complex\nsnaking and laddering phenomena. The final theoretical contribution shows how\nthese concepts relate to the response and energy barriers of an axially\ncompressed cylindrical shell.\n  After surveying NASA's current shell-testing programme, a new non-destructive\ntechnique is proposed to estimate the 'shock sensitivity' of a laboratory\nspecimen that is in a compressed meta-stable state before buckling. A probe is\nused to measure the nonlinear load-deflection characteristic under a rigidly\napplied lateral displacement. Sensing the passive resisting force, it can be\nplotted in real time against the displacement, displaying an equilibrium path\nalong which the force rises to a maximum and then decreases to zero: having\nreached the free state of the shell that forms a mountain-pass in the potential\nenergy. The area under this graph gives the energy barrier against lateral\nshocks. The test is repeated at different levels of the overall compression. If\na symmetry-breaking bifurcation is encountered on the path, computer\nsimulations show how this can be supressed by a controlled secondary probe\ntuned to deliver zero force on the shell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 17:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

This is quite different in both shape and\nmagnitude from the lags predicted by simple reflection models, but very similar\nto the hard X-ray lags often seen in black hole X-ray binaries. We apply\nseveral spectral models to the lag-energy spectrum and rule out simple\nreflection as an origin for the hard lags. We find that both propagating\nfluctuations embedded in the accretion flow and electron scattering from\nmaterial embedded in or behind a cold absorbing medium offer equally good fits\nto the observed low-frequency hard X-ray lags and are both consistent with the\ntime-averaged spectrum. Such models will likely look very different outside of\nXMM-Newton's observable bandpass, paving the way for future studies with\nNuSTAR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 18:51:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 14:34:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

These\nmethodologies were originally developed for the description of the dissipative\ndynamics of a quantum system, and here they are applied to explore the problem\nof quantum energy transport in a non-equilibrium setting.

Thus, techniques that proved\nmeaningful for describing the RDM dynamics, to some extent even beyond their\nrigorous range of validity, should be used with great caution in heat transfer\ncalculations, since qualitative-serious failures develop once parameters are\nmildly stretched beyond the techniques' working assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 19:22:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

Although DNNs work well whenever large\nlabeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to\nsequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence\nlearning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method\nuses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to\na vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the\ntarget sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to\nFrench translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by\nthe LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's\nBLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did\nnot have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT\nsystem achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM\nto rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its\nBLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on\nthis task. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations\nthat are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and\nthe passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in\nall source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance\nmarkedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the\nsource and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 19:55:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Oct 2014 12:13:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2014 20:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}

The star formation history confirms the episodic formation\nhistory of Carina and quantifies the duration and strength of each episode in\ngreat detail, as a function radius from the centre. Two main episodes of star\nformation occurred at old (>8 Gyr) and intermediate (2-8 Gyr) ages, both\nenriching stars starting from low metallicities ([Fe/H]<-2 dex). By dividing\nthe SFH into two components, we determine that 60pm9 percent of the total\nnumber of stars formed within the intermediate age episode. Furthermore, within\nthe tidal radius (0.48 degrees or 888 pc) a total mass in stars of 1.07pm0.08\nx10^6 M_sun was formed, giving Carina a stellar mass-to-light ratio of\n1.8pm0.8. Combining the detailed star formation history with spectroscopic\nobservations of RGB stars, we are able to determine the detailed\nage-metallicity relation of each episode and the timescale of alpha-element\nevolution of Carina from individual stars. The oldest episode displays a tight\nage-metallicity relation over 6 Gyr with steadily declining alpha-element\nabundances and a possible alpha-element knee at [Fe/H]~ -2.5 dex.

First, we propose novel ratio based test statistics for detecting the\nedges of each sub-band. Second, we employ simple energy comparison approach to\nchoose one reference white sub-band.

NuSTAR was primarily designed for\nspectroscopic observations of sources with relatively low count-rates rather\nthan for timing analysis of bright objects. The instrumental dead time per\nevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percent\nevent-to-event. The most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noise\nlevel in the power density spectrum (PDS) that cannot be modeled easily with\nthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time. In this\npaper, we show that it is possible to exploit the presence of two completely\nindependent focal planes and use the cross power density spectrum to obtain a\ngood proxy of the white noise-subtracted PDS.

In this way, most of the standard timing\nanalysis can be performed, albeit with a sacrifice in signal to noise relative\nto what would be achieved using more standard techniques.

Few studies, however, have investigated variance itself as a trait\nunder genetic control. By focusing primarily on trait means and ignoring the\neffect of alternative alleles on trait variability, we may be missing an\nimportant axis of genetic variation contributing to phenotypic differences\namong individuals. To study genetic effects on individual-to-individual\nphenotypic variability (or intragenotypic variability), we used a panel of\nDrosophila inbred lines and focused on locomotor handedness, in an assay\noptimized to measure variability. We discovered that some lines had\nconsistently high levels of intragenotypic variability among individuals while\nothers had low levels. We demonstrate that the degree of variability is itself\nheritable. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the degree of\nintragenotypic variability as the phenotype across lines, we identified several\ngenes expressed in the brain that affect variability in handedness without\naffecting the mean. One of these genes, Ten-a, implicated a neuropil in the\ncentral complex of the fly brain as influencing the magnitude of behavioral\nvariability, a brain region involved in sensory integration and locomotor\ncoordination. We have validated these results using genetic deficiencies, null\nalleles, and inducible RNAi transgenes. This study reveals the constellation of\nphenotypes that can arise from a single genotype and it shows that different\ngenetic backgrounds differ dramatically in their propensity for phenotypic\nvariability. Because traditional mean-focused GWASs ignore the contribution of\nvariability to overall phenotypic variation, current methods may miss important\nlinks between genotype and phenotype.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 22:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The extension of the\ndiffusion equation results in a trivial shift (by an additive constant) in the\nvalue of the diffusion coefficient, and does not change the form of the rate\nequations.

In the\nScreen step, PCS recruits a (small) subset of indices using a stage-wise\nalgorithm, where in each stage, the algorithm updates the set of recruited\nindices by adding the index $j$ that has the largest (in magnitude) empirical\npartial correlation with $i$. In the Clean step, PCS re-investigates all\nrecruited indices and use them to reconstruct the $i$-th row of $\\Omega$.\n  PCS is computationally efficient and modest in memory use: to estimate a row\nof $\\Omega$, it only needs a few rows (determined sequentially) of the\nempirical covariance matrix. This enables PCS to execute the estimation of a\nlarge precision matrix (e.g., $p=10K$) in a few minutes, and open doors to\nestimating much larger precision matrices.\n  We use PCS for classification. Higher Criticism Thresholding (HCT) is a\nrecent classifier that enjoys optimality, but to exploit its full potential in\npractice, one needs a good estimate of the precision matrix $\\Omega$.

Specifically, we consider a convex optimization problem with a\nglobally coupled linear equality constraint and local polyhedra constraints,\nand develop distributed optimization methods based on the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM). The considered problem has many applications in\nmachine learning and smart grid control problems. Due to the presence of the\npolyhedra constraints, agents in the existing methods have to deal with\npolyhedra constrained subproblems at each iteration. One of the key issues is\nthat projection onto a polyhedra constraint is not trivial, which prohibits\nfrom closed-form solutions or the use of simple algorithms for solving these\nsubproblems. In this paper, by judiciously integrating the proximal\nminimization method with ADMM, we propose a new distributed optimization method\nwhere the polyhedra constraints are handled softly as penalty terms in the\nsubproblems. This makes the subproblems efficiently solvable and consequently\nreduces the overall computation time. Furthermore, we propose a randomized\ncounterpart that is robust against randomly ON/OFF agents and imperfect\ncommunication links. We analytically show that both the proposed methods have a\nworst-case $\\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ convergence rate, where $k$ is the iteration\nnumber.

The model arises in aeroelasticity and models the\ninteraction between a thin, nonlinear panel and a flow of gas in which it is\nimmersed [6, 21, 23]. Recent results in [16, 18] show that the plate component\nof the dynamics (in the presence of a physical plate nonlinearity) converge to\na global compact attracting set of finite dimension; these results were\nobtained in the absence of mechanical damping of any type. Here we show that,\nby incorporating mechanical damping the full flow-plate system, full\ntrajectories---both plate and flow---converge strongly to (the set of)\nstationary states. Weak convergence results require \"minimal\" interior damping,\nand strong convergence of the dynamics are shown with sufficiently large\ndamping. We require the existence of a \"good\" energy balance equation, which is\nonly available when the flows are subsonic. Our proof is based on first showing\nthe convergence properties for regular solutions, which in turn requires\npropagation of initial regularity on the infinite horizon. Then, we utilize the\nexponential decay of the difference of two plate trajectories to show that full\nflow-plate trajectories are uniform-in-time Hadamard continuous. This allows us\nto pass convergence properties of smooth initial data to finite energy type\ninitial data. Physically, our results imply that flutter (a non-static end\nbehavior) does not occur in subsonic dynamics.

While the qualitative\nanalysis of POMDPs with parity objectives is undecidable, recent results show\nthat when restricted to finite-memory policies the problem is EXPTIME-complete.\nWhile the problem is intractable in theory, we present a practical approach to\nsolve the qualitative analysis problem. We designed several heuristics to deal\nwith the exponential complexity, and have used our implementation on a number\nof well-known POMDP examples for robotics applications. Our results provide the\nfirst practical approach to solve the qualitative analysis of robot motion\nplanning with LTL properties in the presence of uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2014 09:16:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 12:24:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 15:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-19"}

These scales are directly connected to the highly\nintermittent fluctuations of the fluxes of momentum and heat at the isothermal\ntop and bottom walls and are statistically distributed around the corresponding\nmean thickness scales. The local boundary layer scales also reflect the strong\nspatial inhomogeneities of both boundary layers due to the large-scale, but\ncomplex and intermittent, circulation that builds up in closed convection\ncells. Similar to turbulent boundary layers, we define inner scales based on\nlocal shear stress which can be consistently extended to the classical viscous\nscales in bulk turbulence, e.g. the Kolmogorov scale, and outer scales based on\nslopes at the wall. We discuss the consequences of our generalization, in\nparticular the scaling of our inner and outer boundary layer thicknesses and\nthe resulting shear Reynolds number with respect to Rayleigh number. The mean\nouter thickness scale for the temperature field is close to the standard\ndefinition of a thermal boundary layer thickness. In the case of the velocity\nfield, under certain conditions the outer scale follows a similar scaling as\nthe Prandtl-Blasius type definition with respect to Rayleigh number, but\ndiffers quantitatively. The friction coefficient c_epsilon scaling is found to\nfall right between the laminar and turbulent limits which indicates that the\nboundary layer exhibits transitional behavior. Additionally, we conduct an\nanalysis of the recently suggested dissipation layer thickness scales versus\nRayleigh number and find a transition in the scaling.

The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately\n35 inverse nanobarns, were collected at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy\n(sqrt(s[NN])) of 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The results are\ncompared to semi-peripheral PbPb collision data at sqrt(s[NN]) = 2.76 TeV,\ncovering similar charged-particle multiplicities in the events. The observed\nazimuthal correlations at large relative pseudorapidity are used to extract the\nsecond-order (v[2]) and third-order (v[3]) anisotropy harmonics of K0S and\nLambda/anti-Lambda particles. These quantities are studied as a function of the\ncharged-particle multiplicity in the event and the transverse momentum of the\nparticles.

The first five observations monitor the\nsource as its luminosity increases across the high-soft state of accretion. In\nthe sixth observation the source has made a transition to an \"anomalous\" state,\ncharacterised by a significant contribution of electron scattering. A\nthermally/radiatively driven disc wind is present in the first four\nobservations, which becomes more photoionised as the luminosity increases with\ntime. In the fifth observation, the wind is not observed any more as a\nconsequence of strong photoionisation and the low sensitivity of this\nobservation. This overall trend is then consistent with a fully ionised wind\ncausing the electron scattering characteristic of the anomalous state in the\nsixth observation. A broad iron emission line co-exists with the absorption\nfeatures from the wind in the first four observations but is not visible in the\nlast two observations. We find that the changes in the state of the wind as\nmeasured from modelling the absorption features with a self-consistent warm\nabsorber model are correlated to the changes in the broad iron line. When the\nlatter is modeled with a reflection component we find that the reflection\nfraction decreases as the illumination increases. We propose that the changes\nin both the absorption and broad emission lines are caused by the increasing\nluminosity and temperature of the accretion disc along the soft state.

The expansion drives a parallel or perpendicular\ntemperature anisotropy (depending on the orientation of the ambient magnetic\nfield). For the chosen parameters the Coulomb collisions are important with\nrespect to the driver but are not strong enough to keep the system stable with\nrespect to instabilities driven by the proton temperature anisotropy. In the\ncase of the parallel temperature anisotropy the dominant oblique fire hose\ninstability efficiently reduces the anisotropy in a quasilinear manner. In the\ncase of the perpendicular temperature anisotropy the dominant mirror\ninstability generates coherent compressive structures which scatter protons and\nreduce the temperature anisotropy. For both the cases the instabilities\ngenerate temporarily enough wave energy so that the corresponding (anomalous)\ntransport coefficients dominate over the collisional ones and their properties\nare similar to those in collisionless plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2014 12:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

For both the 0.7-anomaly and the Kondo effect, the conductance\nshows a remarkably similar low-energy dependence on temperature $T$,\nsource-drain voltage $V_{\\rm sd}$ and magnetic field $B$. In a recent\npublication [F. Bauer et al., Nature, 501, 73 (2013)], we argued that the\nreason for these similarities is that both a QPC and a KQD feature spin\nfluctuations that are induced by the sample geometry, confined in a small\nspatial regime, and enhanced by interactions. Here we further explore this\nnotion experimentally and theoretically by studying the geometric crossover\nbetween a QD and a QPC, focussing on the $B$-field dependence of the\nconductance. We introduce a one-dimensional model that reproduces the essential\nfeatures of the experiments, including a smooth transition between a Kondo QD\nand a QPC with 0.7-anomaly. We find that in both cases the anomalously strong\nnegative magnetoconductance goes hand in hand with strongly enhanced local spin\nfluctuations. Our experimental observations include, in addition to the Kondo\neffect in a QD and the 0.7-anomaly in a QPC, Fano interference effects in a\nregime of coexistence between QD and QPC physics, and Fabry-Perot-type\nresonances on the conductance plateaus of a clean QPC. We argue that\nFabry-Perot-type resonances occur generically if the electrostatic potential of\nthe QPC generates a flatter-than-parabolic barrier top.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2014 12:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-11"}

As a consequence, we find\nthat the Grassmann sigma model admits neutral bions made of BPS and anti-BPS\nfractional instantons each of which has topological charge greater (less) than\none (minus one), that are not decomposable into instanton anti-instanton and\nthe rests. The ${\\mathbb C}P^{N_{\\rm F}-1}$ model is found to have no charged\nbions. In contrast, we find that the Grassmann sigma model admits charged\nbions, for which we construct exact non-BPS solutions of the field equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2014 14:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-12"}

Conceptually, the case for using ILP to construct relational\nfeatures rests on treating these features as functions, the automated discovery\nof which necessarily requires some form of first-order learning. Practically,\nthere are now several reports in the literature that suggest that augmenting\nany existing features with ILP-discovered relational features can substantially\nimprove the predictive power of a model. While the approach is straightforward\nenough, much still needs to be done to scale it up to explore more fully the\nspace of possible features that can be constructed by an ILP system. This is in\nprinciple, infinite and in practice, extremely large. Applications have been\nconfined to heuristic or random selections from this space. In this paper, we\naddress this computational difficulty by allowing features to be constructed in\na distributed manner. That is, there is a network of computational units, each\nof which employs an ILP engine to construct some small number of features and\nthen builds a (local) model. We then employ a consensus-based algorithm, in\nwhich neighboring nodes share information to update local models.

We find that as the number of chains in the array increases\nthe plasmon peak shifts from the sub-eV towards the visible range. As doping\nwith TM atoms increases, the visible absorption band broadens, owing to\nformation of additional plasmon peaks. The optical response is very sensitive\nto the type of doped atoms, their number and position; in particular, the\nadditional peaks are most pronounced in the case of weak doping when they\ncorrespond to local plasmon oscillations around the impurity atom.
