As per previous simulations, which were either unstratified or\nstratified with a smaller vertical domain, we find that the $q$ dependence of\nstress for the stratified case is not linear, contrary to the Shakura-Sunyaev\nmodel. We find that the scaling agrees with \\cite{1996MNRAS.281L..21A} who\nfound it to be proportional to the shear to vorticity ratio $q/(2-q)$. We also\nfind however, that the shape of the magnetic and kinetic energy spectra are\nrelatively insensitive to $q$ and that the ratio of Maxwell stress to magnetic\nenergy ratio also remains nearly independent of $q$. This is consistent with a\ntheoretical argument in which the rate of amplification of the azimuthal field\ndepends linearly on $q$ and the turbulent correlation time $\\tau$ depends\ninversely on $q$. As such, we measure the correlation time of the turbulence\nand find that indeed it is inversely proportional to $q$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 17:42:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 18:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The SFR in turn can be used to make a host of predictions\nconcerning the ionization history of the Universe, the chemical abundances, and\nsupernova rates. We compare the predictions made using a hierarchical model of\ncosmic chemical evolution based on three recently proposed SFRs: two based on\nextracting the SFR from the observed gamma-ray burst rate at high redshift, and\none based on the observed galaxy luminosity function at high redshift. Using\nthe WMAP/Planck data on the optical depth and epoch of reionization, we find\nthat only the SFR inferred from gamma-ray burst data at high redshift suffices\nto allow a single mode (in the initial mass function) of star formation which\nextends from z = 0 to redshifts > 10. For the case of the more conservative SFR\nbased on the observed galaxy luminosity function, the reionization history of\nthe Universe requires a bimodal IMF which includes at least a coeval high (or\nintermediate) mass mode of star formation at high redshift (z> 10). Therefore,\nwe also consider here a more general bimodal case which includes an\nearly-forming high mass mode as a fourth model to test the chemical history of\nthe Universe.

An\ninterpretation of such a function as the energy of a classical system allows us\nto reduce the optimization problem into the preparation of a low-temperature\nthermal state of the system. Motivated by the quantum annealing method, we\npresent three strategies to prepare the low-temperature state that exploit\nquantum mechanics in remarkable ways. We focus on implementations without\nuncontrolled errors induced by the environment. This allows us to rigorously\nprove a quantum advantage. The first strategy uses a classical-to-quantum\nmapping, where the equilibrium properties of a classical system in $d$ spatial\ndimensions can be determined from the ground state properties of a quantum\nsystem also in $d$ spatial dimensions. We show how such a ground state can be\nprepared by means of quantum annealing, including quantum adiabatic evolutions.\nThis mapping also allows us to unveil some fundamental relations between\nsimulated and quantum annealing. The second strategy builds upon the first one\nand introduces a technique called spectral gap amplification to reduce the time\nrequired to prepare the same quantum state adiabatically. If implemented on a\nquantum device that exploits quantum coherence, this strategy leads to a\nquadratic improvement in complexity over the well-known bound of the classical\nsimulated annealing method. The third strategy is not purely adiabatic;\ninstead, it exploits diabatic processes between the low-energy states of the\ncorresponding quantum system. For some problems it results in an exponential\nspeedup (in the oracle model) over the best classical algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 19:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We study the performance and results of this model, and\ndiscuss implications for future dust modelling. The present work extends the DL\ndust modelling carried out on nearby galaxies using Herschel and Spitzer data\nto Galactic dust emission. We employ the DL dust model to generate maps of the\ndust mass surface density, the optical extinction Av, and the starlight\nintensity parametrized by Umin. The DL model reproduces the observed spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) satisfactorily over most of the sky, with small\ndeviations in the inner Galactic disk and in low ecliptic latitude areas. We\ncompare the DL optical extinction Av for the diffuse interstellar medium with\noptical estimates for 2 10^5 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) observed in the Sloan\ndigital sky survey. The DL Av estimates are larger than those determined\ntowards QSOs by a factor of about 2, which depends on Umin. The DL fitting\nparameter Umin, effectively determined by the wavelength where the SED peaks,\nappears to trace variations in the far-IR opacity of the dust grains per unit\nAv, and not only in the starlight intensity. To circumvent the model\ndeficiency, we propose an empirical renormalization of the DL Av estimate,\ndependent of Umin, which compensates for the systematic differences found with\nQSO observations. This renormalization also brings into agreement the DL Av\nestimates with those derived for molecular clouds from the near-IR colours of\nstars in the 2 micron all sky survey. The DL model and the QSOs data are used\nto compress the spectral information in the Planck and IRAS observations for\nthe diffuse ISM to a family of 20 SEDs normalized per Av, parameterized by\nUmin, which may be used to test and empirically calibrate dust models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 20:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Oct 2014 14:18:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 22:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

In such systems, the excitations of the bound\nstate are often delocalized and characterized by a large entropy, so that the\nbound state is strongly entangled with the rest of the statistical system. If\nthis entropy $S$ increases with the separation $r$ between the constituents of\nthe bound state, $S = S(r)$, then the resulting entropic force $F = T\\\n{\\partial S}/{\\partial r}$ ($T$ is temperature) can drive the dissociation\nprocess. As a specific example, we consider the case of heavy quarkonium in\nstrongly coupled quark-gluon plasma, where lattice QCD indicates a large amount\nof entropy associated with the heavy quark pair at temperatures $0.9\\ T_c \\leq\nT \\leq 1.5\\ T_c$ ($T_c$ is the deconfinement temperature); this entropy $S(r)$\ngrows with the inter-quark distance $r$. We argue that the entropic mechanism\nresults in an anomalously strong quarkonium suppression in the temperature\nrange near $T_c$. This \"entropic self-destruction\" may thus explain why the\nexperimentally measured quarkonium nuclear modification factor at RHIC (lower\nenergy density) is smaller than at LHC (higher energy density), possibly\nresolving the \"quarkonium suppression puzzle\" - all of the previously known\nmechanisms of quarkonium dissociation operate more effectively at higher energy\ndensities, and this contradicts the data. Moreover, we find that near $T_c$ the\nentropic force leads to delocalization of the bound hadron states; we argue\nthat this delocalization may be the mechanism underlying deconfinement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 20:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 15:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

We simultaneously fit ~230 velocity and ~6800 magnitude\nmeasurements distributed over 21 photometric passbands spanning wavelengths\nfrom 0.19 to 2.2 microns. The light curve differences among the Type II-Plateau\nsupernovae are well-modeled by assuming different rates of photospheric radius\nexpansion, which we explain as different density profiles of the ejecta and we\nargue that steeper density profiles result in flatter plateaus, if everything\nelse remains unchanged. The steep luminosity decline of Type II-Linear\nsupernovae is due to fast evolution of the photospheric temperature, which we\nverify with a successful fit of SN1980K. Eliminating the need for theoretical\nsupernova atmosphere models, we obtain self-consistent relative distances,\nreddenings, and nickel masses fully accounting for all internal model\nuncertainties and covariances. We use our global fit to estimate the time\nevolution of any missing band tailored specifically for each supernova and we\nconstruct spectral energy distributions and bolometric light curves.

Using recent determinations of the rate of GRBs, their\nluminosity function and properties of their host galaxies, we estimate the\nprobability that a life-threatening (lethal) GRB would take place. Amongst the\ndifferent kinds of GRBs, long ones are most dangerous. There is a very good\nchance (but no certainty) that at least one lethal GRB took place during the\npast 5 Gyr close enough to Earth as to significantly damage life. There is a\n50% chance that such a lethal GRB took place during the last 500 Myr causing\none of the major mass extinction events. Assuming that a similar level of\nradiation would be lethal to life on other exoplanets hosting life, we explore\nthe potential effects of GRBs to life elsewhere in the Galaxy and the Universe.\nWe find that the probability of a lethal GRB is much larger in the inner Milky\nWay (95% within a radius of 4 kpc from the galactic center), making it\ninhospitable to life. Only at the outskirts of the Milky Way, at more than 10\nkpc from the galactic center, this probability drops below 50%. When\nconsidering the Universe as a whole, the safest environments for life (similar\nto the one on Earth) are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large\ngalaxies and life can exist in only ~ 10% of galaxies. Remarkably, a\ncosmological constant is essential for such systems to exist.

The formation and evolution of the Milky Way bulge is still largely\nan unanswered question. One of the most essential observables needed in its\nmodelling are the metallicity distribution and the trends of the alpha elements\nas measured in stars. While Bulge regions beyond R > 50 pc of the centre has\nbeen targeted in several surveys, the central part has escaped detailed study\ndue to the extreme extinction and crowding. The abundance gradients from the\ncenter are, however, of large diagnostic value. Aims. We aim at investigating\nthe Galactic Centre environment by probing M giants in the field, avoiding\nsupergiants and cluster members. Methods. For 9 field M-giants in the Galactic\nCentre region, we have obtained high- and low-resolution spectra observed\nsimultaneously with CRIRES and ISAAC on UT1 and UT3 of the VLT. The\nlow-resolution spectra provide a means of determining the effective\ntemperatures, and the high-resolution spectra provide detailed abundances of\nFe, Mg, Si, and Ca. Results. We find a metal-rich population at\n[Fe/H]=+0.11+-0.15 and a lack of the metal-poor population, found further out\nin the Bulge, corroborating earlier studies. Our [alpha/Fe] element trends,\nhowever, show low values, following the outer Bulge trends. A possible\nexception of the [Ca/Fe] trend is found and needs further investigation.\nConclusions. The results of the analysed field M-giants in the Galactic Centre\nregion, excludes a scenario with rapid formation, in which SNIIe played a\ndominated role in the chemical enrichment of the gas. The metal-rich\nmetallicities together with low alpha-enhancement seems to indicate a bar-like\npopulation perhaps related to the nuclear bar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 20:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

Agreement with constraints from low energy flavor observables,\nin particular Kaon mixing, is obtained for supersymmetric particles with masses\nat the PeV scale or above.

During accretion\noutbursts, inward heat transport has only a small effect on the temperature\nprofile in the outer layers until the ocean is strongly enriched in light\nelements, a process that takes hundreds of years to complete. During\nquiescence, however, inward heat transport rapidly cools the outer layers of\nthe ocean while keeping the inner layers hot. We find that this leads to a\nsharp drop in surface emission at around a week followed by a gradual recovery\nas cooling becomes dominated by the crust. Such a dip should be observable in\nthe light curves of these neutron star transients, if enough data is taken at a\nfew days to a month after the end of accretion. If such a dip is definitively\nobserved, it will provide strong constraints on the chemical composition of the\nocean and outer crust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 21:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The present work is concerned with the gravitational collapse\nof such clumps, idealized as being spherically symmetric. Calculations using\nthe two-fluid model are performed (almost) up to the time when a central\ndensity singularity forms. The end result of the study is a parametrization for\nthis time, in order that it may be compared with timescales for various\ndisruptive effects to which clumps may be subject. An important effect is that\nas the clump compresses, it also compresses the gas due to drag. This increases\ngas pressure which retards particle collapse and leads to oscillation in the\nsize and density of the clump. The ratio of gravitational force to gas pressure\ngives a two-phase Jeans parameter, $J_t$, which is the classical Jeans\nparameter with the sound speed replaced by an the wave speed in a coupled\ntwo-fluid medium. Its use makes the results insensitive to the initial density\nratio of particles to gas as a separate parameter. An ordinary differential\nequation model is developed which takes the form of two coupled non-linear\noscillators and reproduces key features of the simulations. Finally, a\nparametric study of the time to collapse is performed and a formula (fit to the\nsimulations) is developed. In the incompressible limit $J_t \\to 0$, collapse\ntime equals sedimentation time. As $J_t$ increases, the collapse time decreases\nroughly linearly with $J_t$ until $J_t \\gtrsim 0.4$ when it becomes\napproximately equal to the dynamical time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 22:28:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 23:03:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2015 08:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-01"}

However, there has recently been controversy over whether it\ngives any advantage in precision. While it is now clear that retaining failed\npostselections can yield more Fisher information than discarding them, the\nadvantage of postselection measurement itself still remains to be clarified. In\nthis Letter, we address this problem by studying two widely used estimation\nstrategies: averaging measurement results, and maximum likelihood estimation,\nrespectively. For the first strategy, we find a surprising result that squeezed\ncoherent states of the pointer can give postselected weak measurements a higher\nsignal-to-noise ratio than standard ones while all standard coherent states\ncannot, which suggests that raising the precision of weak measurements by\npostselection calls for the presence of \"nonclassicality\" in the pointer\nstates. For the second strategy, we show that the quantum Fisher information of\npostselected weak measurements is generally larger than that of standard weak\nmeasurements, even without using the failed postselection events, but the gap\ncan be closed with a proper choice of system state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 01:47:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 20:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 20:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-18"}

In model-based methods, problem\ndomain knowledge can be built into the constraints of the model, typically at\nthe expense of difficulties during inference. In contrast, deterministic deep\nneural networks are constructed in such a way that inference is\nstraightforward, but their architectures are generic and it is unclear how to\nincorporate knowledge. This work aims to obtain the advantages of both\napproaches. To do so, we start with a model-based approach and an associated\ninference algorithm, and \\emph{unfold} the inference iterations as layers in a\ndeep network. Rather than optimizing the original model, we \\emph{untie} the\nmodel parameters across layers, in order to create a more powerful network. The\nresulting architecture can be trained discriminatively to perform accurate\ninference within a fixed network size. We show how this framework allows us to\ninterpret conventional networks as mean-field inference in Markov random\nfields, and to obtain new architectures by instead using belief propagation as\nthe inference algorithm. We then show its application to a non-negative matrix\nfactorization model that incorporates the problem-domain knowledge that sound\nsources are additive. Deep unfolding of this model yields a new kind of\nnon-negative deep neural network, that can be trained using a multiplicative\nbackpropagation-style update algorithm.

Advanced\nNMR experiments indicate that these conformational changes can occur in the\nabsence of ligand molecules (or with bound ligands), and that the ligands may\n'select' protein conformations for binding (or unbinding). In this review, we\nargue that this conformational selection requires transition times for ligand\nbinding and unbinding that are small compared to the dwell times of proteins in\ndifferent conformations, which is plausible for small ligand molecules. Such a\nseparation of timescales leads to a decoupling and temporal ordering of\nbinding/unbinding events and conformational changes. We propose that\nconformational-selection and induced-change processes (such as induced fit) are\ntwo sides of the same coin, because the temporal ordering is reversed in\nbinding and unbinding direction. Conformational-selection processes can be\ncharacterized by a conformational excitation that occurs prior to a binding or\nunbinding event, while induced-change processes exhibit a characteristic\nconformational relaxation that occurs after a binding or unbinding event. We\ndiscuss how the ordering of events can be determined from relaxation rates and\neffective on- and off-rates determined in mixing experiments, and from the\nconformational exchange rates measured in advanced NMR or single-molecule FRET\nexperiments. For larger ligand molecules such as peptides, conformational\nchanges and binding events can be intricately coupled and exhibit aspects of\nconformational-selection and induced-change processes in both binding and\nunbinding direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 03:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-10"}

While the\noptimal mechanism that maximizes the intermediary's profit in such a setting\nmay be quite complicated, the mechanisms observed in reality are generally much\nsimpler, e.g., applying an affine function to the price of the transaction as\nthe intermediary's fee. Loertscher and Niedermayer [2007] initiated the study\nof such fee-setting mechanisms in two-sided markets, and we continue this\ninvestigation by addressing the question of when an affine fee schedule is\napproximately optimal for worst-case seller distribution. On one hand our work\nsupplies non-trivial sufficient conditions on the buyer side (i.e. linearity of\nmarginal revenue function, or MHR property of value and value minus cost\ndistributions) under which an affine fee schedule can obtain a constant\nfraction of the intermediary's optimal profit for all seller distributions. On\nthe other hand we complement our result by showing that proper affine\nfee-setting mechanisms (e.g. those used in eBay and Amazon selling plans) are\nunable to extract a constant fraction of optimal profit in the worst-case\nseller distribution. As subsidiary results we also show there exists a constant\ngap between maximum surplus and maximum revenue under the aforementioned\nconditions.

Here we show that the\nemergence of these types of neurons can be quantitatively described by the\ntheory of transitions between different phases of matter. The two key\nparameters that control the separation of neurons into subclasses are the mean\nand standard deviation of noise levels among neurons in the population. The\nmean noise level plays the role of temperature in the classic theory of phase\ntransitions, whereas the standard deviation is equivalent to pressure, in the\ncase of liquid-gas transitions, or to magnetic field for magnetic transitions.\nOur results account for properties of two recently discovered types of\nsalamander OFF retinal ganglion cells, as well as the absence of multiple types\nof ON cells.

This behavior persists also in the presence of a\nmonovalent salt bath and results in significant violation of the contact-value\ntheorem, reflecting the anti-fragility effects of the disorder that drive the\nsystem towards a more ordered state. In the presence of an interfacial\ndielectric discontinuity, depleting the counterion layer at the surface, the\ncharge disorder still generates a much enhanced counterion density further away\nfrom the surface. Likewise, the charge inversion and/or overcharging of the\nsurface occur more strongly and at smaller bulk concentrations of multivalent\ncounterions when the surface carries quenched charge disorder. Overall, the\npresence of quenched surface charge disorder leads to sizable effects in the\ndistribution of multivalent counterions in a wide range of realistic parameters\nand typically within a distance of a few nanometers from the charged surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 06:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

If the disk is optically\nthick, scattering dominated and permeated by a Keplerian velocity field,\nNon-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium radiative transfer modeling must be done to\ncompute the emergent spectrum from a given disk model. We investigate Non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium polarized line formation in different simple disk\nmodels and aim to demonstrate the importance of both radiative transfer effects\nand scattering as well as the effects of velocity fields. We self-consistently\nsolve the coupled equations of radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium\nfor a two level atom model by means of Jacobi iteration. We compute scattering\npolarization, that is Q/I and U/I line profiles. The degree of scattering\npolarization is significantly influenced by the inclination of the disk with\nrespect to observer, but also by the optical thickness of the disk and the\npresence of rotation. Stokes U shows double-lobed profiles with amplitude which\nincreases with the disk rotation. Our results suggest that the line profiles,\nespecially the polarized ones, emerging from gaseous disks differ significantly\nfrom the profiles predicted by simple approximations. The profiles are diverse\nin shape, but typically symmetric in Stokes Q and antisymmetric in Stokes U. A\nclear indicator of disk rotation is the presence of Stokes U, which might prove\nto be a useful diagnostic tool. We also demonstrate that, for moderate\nrotational velocities, an approximate treatment can be used, where non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer is done in the velocity field-free\napproximation and Doppler shift is applied in the process of spatial\nintegration over the whole emitting surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 09:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

Inclusions distort the local interface structure leading to\ninteractions that are fundamentally different from the well-studied\ninteractions mediated by isotropic solvents. Here, we investigate liquid-liquid\nphase separation in monolayer membranes composed of dissimilar chiral colloidal\nrods. We demonstrate that colloidal rafts are a ubiquitous feature of binary\ncolloidal membranes. We measure the raft free energy landscape by visualizing\nits assembly kinetics. Subsequently, we quantify repulsive raft-raft\ninteractions and relate them to directly imaged raft-induced membrane\ndistortions, demonstrating that particle chirality plays a key role in this\nmicrophase separation. At high densities, rafts assemble into cluster crystals\nwhich constantly exchange monomeric rods with the background reservoir to\nmaintain a self-limited size. Lastly, we demonstrate that rafts can form bonds\nto assemble into higher-order supra-structures. Our work demonstrates that\nmembrane-mediated liquid-liquid phase separation can be fundamentally different\nfrom the well-characterized behavior of bulk liquids. It outlines a robust\nmembrane-based pathway for assembly of monodisperse liquid clusters which is\ncomplementary to existing methods which take place in bulk suspensions.\nFinally, it reveals that chiral inclusions in membranes acquire long-ranged\nrepulsive interactions, which might play a role in stabilizing assemblages of\nfinite size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 10:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-10"}

Defining the\nlocal compressibility as the derivative of the local one-body density w.r.t.\nthe chemical potential at fixed temperature, we use density functional theory\n(DFT) to calculate chi(z) for a model fluid, close to bulk liquid-gas\ncoexistence, at various planar substrates. These range from a `neutral'\nsubstrate with a contact angle of approximately 90 degrees, which favours\nneither the liquid nor the gas phase, to a very solvophobic, purely repulsive\nsubstrate which exhibits complete drying (i.e. contact angle 180 degrees). We\nfind that the maximum in the local compressibility, which occurs within one-two\nmolecular diameters of the substrate, and the integrated quantity chi_ex (the\nsurface excess compressibility, defined below) both increase rapidly as the\ncontact angle increases and the substrate becomes more solvophobic. The local\ncompressibility provides a more pronounced indicator of solvophobicity than the\ndensity depletion in the vicinity of the surface which increases only weakly\nwith increasing contact angle. When the fluid is confined in a parallel slit\nwith two identical solvophobic walls, or with competing solvophobic and\nsolvophilic walls, chi(z) close to the solvophobic wall is altered little from\nthat at the single substrate. We connect our results with simulation studies of\nwater near to hydrophobic surfaces exploring the relationship between chi(z)\nand fluctuations in the local density and between chi_ex and the mean-square\nfluctuation in the number of adsorbed molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 13:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

It is still unclear\nwhich of the different excitation components that characterise the mid- and\nnear-IR H$_2$ distribution is associated with H$_2$O. Aim: The aim is to\nspectrally resolve the different excitation components observed in the H$_2$\nemission. This will allow us to identify the H$_2$ counterpart associated with\nH$_2$O and finally derive directly an H$_2$O abundance estimate with respect to\nH$_2$. Methods: We present new high spectral resolution observations of H$_2$\n0-0 S(4), 0-0 S(9), and 1-0 S(1) towards HH 54, a bright nearby shock region in\nthe southern sky. In addition, new Herschel-HIFI H$_2$O (2$_{12}$$-$1$_{01}$)\nobservations at 1670~GHz are presented. Results: Our observations show for the\nfirst time a clear separation in velocity of the different H$_2$ lines: the 0-0\nS(4) line at the lowest excitation peaks at $-$7~km~s$^{-1}$, while the more\nexcited 0-0 S(9) and 1-0 S(1) lines peak at $-$15~km~s$^{-1}$. H$_2$O and\nhigh-$J$ CO appear to be associated with the H$_2$ 0-0 S(4) emission, which\ntraces a gas component with a temperature of 700$-$1000 K.

Conclusions: We resolve two distinct gas components\nassociated with the HH 54 shock region at different velocities and excitations.\nThis allows us to constrain the temperature of the H$_2$O emitting gas\n($\\leq$1000 K) and to derive correct estimates of H$_2$O abundance in the\nshocked gas, which is lower than what is expected from shock model predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 15:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

Conversely,\nsolvent quality and surface attraction are reflected in equilibrium\nforce-extension curves that can be measured in experiments. To investigate\nthese effects theoretically, we study tethered chains under tension with\nWang-Landau simulations of a bond-fluctuation lattice model. Applying our model\nto pulling experiments on biological molecules we obtain a good description of\nexperimental data in the intermediate force range, where universal features\ndominate and finite size effects are small. For tethered chains in poor\nsolvent, we observe the predicted two-phase coexistence at transitions from the\nglobule to stretched conformations and also discover direct transitions from\ncrystalline to stretched conformations. A phase portrait for finite chains\nconstructed by evaluating the density of states for a broad range of solvent\nconditions and tensions shows how increasing tension leads to a disappearance\nof the globular phase. For chains in good solvents tethered to hard and\nattractive surfaces we find the predicted scaling with the chain length in the\nlow-force regime and show that our results are well described by an analytical,\nindependent-bond approximation for the bond-fluctuation model for the highest\ntensions. Finally, for a hard or slightly attractive surface the stretching of\na tethered chain is a conformational change that does not correspond to a phase\ntransition. However, when the surface attraction is sufficient to adsorb a\nchain it will undergo a desorption transition at a critical value of the\napplied force. Our results for force-induced desorption show the transition to\nbe discontinuous with partially desorbed conformations in the coexistence\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 02:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We conclude\nthat this extra Lorentz noninvariant contribution is unable to address the\nproblems of stability and unitarity of higher-derivative gravity models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 21:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-22"}

The user's interactions needs to be propagated through these\nmodules and reflected in the output representation at a fast pace. Each\nindividual module may be easy to develop and manage, but the dependency\nstructure can be quite challenging. The MVC (Model/View/Controller) pattern is\nan attempt to solve the problem by separating the user's interaction from the\nrepresentation of the data. In this paper we discuss the paradigm of reactive\nprogramming in the framework of the MVC architecture and show its applicability\nto interactive graphics. Under this paradigm, developers benefit from the\nseparation of user interaction from the graphical representation, which makes\nit easier for users and developers to extend interactive applications. We show\nthe central role of reactive data objects in an interactive graphics system,\nimplemented as the R package cranvas, which is freely available on GitHub and\nthe main developers include the authors of this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 10:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-26"}
