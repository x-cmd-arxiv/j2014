The evolution of the disk structure is\nconsistently taken into account. Extending our earlier studies, we now consider\nthe self-generation of the magnetic field by an $\\alpha^2\\Omega$ mean-field\ndynamo. The disk magnetization remains on a rather low level, that helps to\nevolve the simulations for $T > 10,000$ dynamical time steps on a domain\nextending 1500 inner disk radii. We find a magnetic field of the inner disk\nsimilar to the commonly found open field structure, favoring\nmagneto-centrifugal launching. The outer disk field is highly inclined and\npredominantly radial. Here, differential rotation induces a strong toroidal\ncomponent that plays a key role in outflow launching. These outflows from the\nouter disk are slower, denser, and less collimated. If the dynamo action is not\nquenched, magnetic flux is continuously generated, diffuses outward the disk,\nand fills the entire disk. We have invented a toy model triggering a\ntime-dependent mean-field dynamo. The duty cycles of this dynamo lead to\nepisodic ejections on similar timescales. When the dynamo is suppressed as the\nmagnetization falls below a critical value, the generation of the outflows and\nalso accretion is inhibited. The general result is that we can steer episodic\nejection and {\\em large-scale jet knots} by a {\\em disk-intrinsic dynamo} that\nis time-dependent and regenerates the jet-launching magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 16:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Recent models of ion drag on these planets,\nhowever, are based on thermal ionization only and do not include the upper\natmosphere above the 1 mbar level. These models are also based on simplified\nequations of resistive MHD that are not always valid in extrasolar planet\natmospheres. We show that photoionization dominates over thermal ionization\nover much of the dayside atmosphere above the 100 mbar level, creating an upper\nionosphere dominated by ionization of H and He and a lower ionosphere dominated\nby ionization of metals such as Na, K, and Mg. The resulting dayside electron\ndensities on close-in exoplanets are higher than those encountered in any\nplanetary ionosphere of the solar system, and the conductivities are comparable\nto the chromosphere of the Sun. Based on these results and assumed magnetic\nfields, we constrain the conductivity regimes on close-in EGPs and use a\ngeneralized Ohm's law to study the basic effects of electrodynamics in their\natmospheres. We find that ion drag is important above the 10 mbar level where\nit can also significantly alter the energy balance through resistive heating.\nDue to frequent collisions of the electrons and ions with the neutral\natmosphere, however, ion drag is largely negligible in the lower atmosphere\nbelow the 10 mbar level for a reasonable range of planetary magnetic moments\n[abridged].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 17:34:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

For the core problem of power balance, the\nlegacy paradigm of tailoring supply to follow random demand may be\ninappropriate under deep penetration of uncertain and intermittent renewable\ngeneration. In this situation, there is an emerging consensus that the\nalternative approach of controlling demand to follow random supply offers\ncompelling economic benefits in terms of reduced regulation costs. This\napproach exploits the flexibility of demand side resources and requires\nsensing, actuation, and communication infrastructure; distributed control\nalgorithms; and viable schemes to compensate participating loads. This paper\nconsiders rate-constrained energy services which are a specific paradigm for\nflexible demand. These services are characterized by a specified delivery\nwindow, the total amount of energy that must be supplied over this window, and\nthe maximum rate at which this energy may be delivered. We consider a forward\nmarket where rate-constrained energy services are traded. We explore allocation\npolicies and market decisions of a supplier in this market. The supplier owns a\ngeneration mix that includes some uncertain renewable generation and may also\npurchase energy in day-ahead and real-time markets to meet customer demand. The\nsupplier must optimally select the portfolio of rate-constrained services to\nsell, the amount of day-ahead energy to buy, and the policies for making\nreal-time energy purchases and allocations to customers to maximize its\nexpected profit. We offer solutions to the supplier's decision and control\nproblems to economically provide rate constrained energy services.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 18:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-25"}

From this results, it was found out that high temperature flash\nannealing at 1250 degree has considerable effect on the impurity concentration\nat subsurface region by Secondary Ion Mass spectroscopy (SIMS) and our\ndiffusion model. This effect makes the band bend shape and subband energy\nseparation change. Moreover, It was revealed that the reduction of the impurity\ndistribution was inhibited less than 900 degree of the flashing temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 19:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-25"}

This chapter covers the following aspects: general properties,\nevolution of surface properties, late central evolution, and nucleosynthesis\nincluding their dependence on metallicity, mass loss and rotation. Since very\nmassive stars have very large convective cores during the main-sequence phase,\ntheir evolution is not so much affected by rotational mixing, but more by mass\nloss through stellar winds. Their evolution is never far from a homogeneous\nevolution even without rotational mixing. All VMS at metallicities close to\nsolar end their life as WC(-WO) type Wolf-Rayet stars. Due to very important\nmass loss through stellar winds, these stars may have luminosities during the\nadvanced phases of their evolution similar to stars with initial masses between\n60 and 120 solar masses. A distinctive feature which may be used to disentangle\nWolf-Rayet stars originating from VMS from those originating from lower initial\nmasses is the enhanced abundances of neon and magnesium at the surface of WC\nstars. At solar metallicity, mass loss is so strong that even if a star is born\nwith several hundred solar masses, it will end its life with less than 50 solar\nmasses (using current mass loss prescriptions). At the metallicity of the LMC\nand lower, on the other hand, mass loss is weaker and might enable star to\nundergo pair-instability supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 19:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The conditions necessary to produce LGRBs can affect the relation\nbetween the LGRB rate and star formation. By using the power of a complete LGRB\nsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,\nwhat is its origin. In this first paper, we build the SED of the z<1 host\ngalaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample, and determine their stellar masses from SED\nfitting. We compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) with\nstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA); (ii) with\nsemi-analitical models of the z<1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) with\nnumerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for\nthe progenitor star environment. We find that at z<1 LGRBs tend to avoid\nmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forming\ngalaxies. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with\nthat of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted for their SFR. This\nimplies that, at least at z<1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star\nformation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-end\nof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow SFR-Mass relation for\nthe low mass galaxy population. GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to\nreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order\nof Z_th=0.3-0.5Z_sun is necessary. Models without a metallicity threshold or\nwith an extreme threshold of Z_th = 0.1Z_sun are excluded at z<1. The use of\nthe BAT6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biases\nwhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. The\npreference for low metallicities (Z<~0.5Z_sun) can be a consequence of the\nparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a GRB.\n(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 20:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2015 13:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-18"}

One way to investigate\nthis puzzling issue is to study the number density of quiescent galaxies at\nz~2, and its dependence on mass. Here we present the results of a new study\nbased on very deep Ks-band imaging (with the HAWK-I instrument on the VLT) of\ntwo HST CANDELS fields (the UKIDSS Ultra-deep survey (UDS) field and\nGOODS-South). The new HAWK-I data (taken as part of the HUGS VLT Large Program)\nreach detection limits of Ks>26 (AB mag). We select a sample of\npassively-evolving galaxies in the redshift range 1.4<z<2.5. Thanks to the\ndepth and large area coverage of our imaging, we have been able to extend the\nselection of quiescent galaxies a magnitude fainter than previous analyses.\nThrough extensive simulations we demonstrate, for the first time, that the\nobserved turn-over in the number of quiescent galaxies at K>22 is real. This\nhas enabled us to establish unambiguously that the number counts of quiescent\ngalaxies at z~2 flatten and slightly decline at magnitudes fainter than\nKs~22(AB mag.). We show that this trend corresponds to a stellar mass threshold\n$M_*10^{10.8}\\,{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ below which the mechanism that halts the star\nformation in high-redshift galaxies seems to be inefficient. Finally we compare\nthe observed pBzK number counts with those of quiescent galaxies extracted from\nfour different semi-analytic models. We find that none of the models provides a\nstatistically acceptable description of the number density of quiescent\ngalaxies at these redshifts. We conclude that the mass function of quiescent\ngalaxies as a function of redshift continues to present a key and demanding\nchallenge for proposed models of galaxy formation and evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 20:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

In such a\nnetwork, for an arbitrary fixed initial time, a subset of individuals forms an\neminence grise coalition, abbreviated as EGC, if the individuals in that subset\nare capable of leading the entire network to agreeing on any desired opinion,\nthrough a cooperative choice of their own initial opinions. In this endeavor,\nthe coalition members are assumed to have access to full profile of the\nunderlying graph of the network as well as the initial opinions of all other\nindividuals. While the complete coalition of individuals always qualifies as an\nEGC, we establish the existence of a minimum size EGC for an arbitrary\ntime-varying network; also, we develop a non-trivial set of upper and lower\nbounds on that size. As a result, we show that, even when the underlying graph\ndoes not guarantee convergence to a global or multiple consensus, a generally\nrestricted coalition of agents can steer public opinion towards a desired\nglobal consensus without affecting any of the predefined graph interactions,\nprovided they can cooperatively adjust their own initial opinions.

We use EuTiO3 as a prototype\nwith relatively well-known material parameters. Surprisingly strong influence\nof this coupling practically on all the properties without external fields was\nobtained in the temperature region with coexistence of antiferromagnetic and\nantiferrodistorted phases i.e. in multiferroic state. In particular, the\nobserved Neel temperature TN (5.5 K) was shown to be defined by rotomagnetic\ncoupling, while without this coupling TN appeared to be much higher (26 K). For\nsmall or high enough rotomagnetic coupling constant value the antiferromagnetic\nphase transition order appeared to be the second or the first order\nrespectively.

The fully or partially\nionized disk surface is expected to produce free-free continuum emission at\ncentimeter (cm) wavelengths that can be routinely detected with interferometers\nsuch as the upgraded Very Large Array (VLA). We use deep (rms noise down to 8\n$\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in the field of view center) 3.5 cm maps of the nearby (130\npc) Corona Australis (CrA) star formation (SF) region to constrain disk\nphotoevaporation models. We find that the radio emission from disk sources in\nCrA is surprisingly faint. Only 3 out of 10 sources within the field of view\nare detected, with flux densities of order $10^2$ $\\mu$Jy. However, a\nsignificant fraction of their emission is non-thermal. Typical upper limits for\nnon-detections are $3\\sigma\\sim 60~\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Assuming analytic\nexpressions for the free-free emission from extreme-UV (EUV) irradiation, we\nderive stringent upper limits to the ionizing photon luminosity impinging on\nthe disk surface $\\Phi_\\mathrm{EUV}<1-4\\times10^{41}$ s$^{-1}$. These limits\nconstrain $\\Phi_\\mathrm{EUV}$ to the low end of the values needed by EUV-driven\nphotoevaporation models to clear protoplanetary disks in the observed few Myr\ntimescale. Therefore, at least in CrA, EUV-driven photoevaporation is not\nlikely to be the main agent of disk dispersal. We also compare the observed\nX-ray luminosities $L_X$ of disk sources with models in which photoevaporation\nis driven by such photons. Although predictions are less specific than for the\nEUV case, most of the observed fluxes (upper limits) are roughly consistent\nwith the (scaled) predictions. Deeper observations, as well as predictions\nspanning a wider parameter space, are needed to properly test X-ray driven\nphotoevaporation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 21:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

We tested two different\ncorrection approaches on an XMM-Newton EPIC-pn observation taken in Timing\nmode: the standard Rate Dependent CTI (RDCTI or epfast) and the new, Rate\nDependent Pulse Height Amplitude (RDPHA) corrections.

This is\ntypically achieved by selecting an appropriate snapshot space and a local\nspectral decomposition, e.g., the use of oversampled regions in order to\nachieve an efficient model reduction. However, the successful construction of\nsnapshot spaces may be costly if too many local problems need to be solved in\norder to obtain these spaces. In this paper, we show that this efficiency can\nbe achieved using a moderate quantity of local solutions (or snapshot vectors)\nwith random boundary conditions on oversampled regions with zero forcing.\nMotivated by the randomized algorithm presented in [19], we consider a snapshot\nspace which consists of harmonic extensions of random boundary conditions\ndefined in a domain larger than the target region. Furthermore, we perform an\neigenvalue decomposition in this small space.

To attack this problem, various block\ncoordinate descent (BCD) algorithms are proposed with convergence being\ncarefully examined. First we propose a two block coordinate descent (2-BCD)\nalgorithm that iteratively designs all the beamformers and the linear receiver,\nwhere both subproblems are convex and the convergence of limit points to\nstationary points is guaranteed. Besides, the thorough solution to optimizing\none single beamformer is given, which, although discussed several times, is\nusually incomplete in existing literature.

Solving the joint beamformers'\ndesign by cyclically updating each separate beamformer under the 2-BCD\nframework gives birth to a layered BCD algorithm, which guarantees convergence\nto stationary points. Besides that, a wide class of multiple BCD algorithms\nusing the general essentially cyclic updating rule has been studied.

On smaller\nscales traced by the SMA data, the chemical complexity and diversity increase\nup to the hot core stage. In the H II region phase, the SMA spectra resemble\nthe spectra of the protostellar phase. Either these more complex molecules are\ndestroyed or their emission is not compact enough to be detected with the SMA.\nSynthetic spectra modelling of the H$_{2}$CO transitions, as detected with the\nAPEX telescope, shows that both a warm and a cold component are needed to\nobtain a good fit to the emission for all sources except for W33 Main1. The\ntemperatures and column densities of the two components increase during the\nevolution of the star forming regions. The integrated intensity ratios\nN$_{2}$H$^{+}$(3$-$2)/CS(6$-$5) and\nN$_{2}$H$^{+}$(3$-$2)/H$_{2}$CO(4$_{2,2}$$-$3$_{2,1}$) show clear trends as a\nfunction of evolutionary stage, luminosity, luminosity-to-mass ratio, and\nH$_{2}$ peak column density of the clumps and might be usable as chemical\nclocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 00:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

The diffusion signal has been modelled as the combined\ncontribution from many individual fascicles of nerve fibers passing through\neach location in the white matter. Typically, this is done via basis pursuit,\nbut estimation of the exact directions is limited due to discretization. The\ndifficulties inherent in modeling DWI data are shared by many other problems\ninvolving fitting non-parametric mixture models. Ekanadaham et al. proposed an\napproach, continuous basis pursuit, to overcome discretization error in the\n1-dimensional case (e.g., spike-sorting). Here, we propose a more general\nalgorithm that fits mixture models of any dimensionality without\ndiscretization. Our algorithm uses the principles of L2-boost, together with\nrefitting of the weights and pruning of the parameters. The addition of these\nsteps to L2-boost both accelerates the algorithm and assures its accuracy. We\nrefer to the resulting algorithm as elastic basis pursuit, or EBP, since it\nexpands and contracts the active set of kernels as needed. We show that in\ncontrast to existing approaches to fitting mixtures, our boosting framework (1)\nenables the selection of the optimal bias-variance tradeoff along the solution\npath, and (2) scales with high-dimensional problems. In simulations of DWI, we\nfind that EBP yields better parameter estimates than a non-negative least\nsquares (NNLS) approach, or the standard model used in DWI, the tensor model,\nwhich serves as the basis for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

Using linear stability analysis, we show that\ndelayed coupling between layers causes translating perturbations of the bumps\nto decay in the noise-free system. Adding noise to the system causes bumps to\nwander as a random walk. However, coupling between layers can reduce the\nvariability of this stochastic motion by canceling noise that perturbs bumps in\nopposite directions. Delays in interlaminar coupling can further reduce\nvariability, since they couple bump positions to states from the past. We\ndemonstrate these relationships by deriving an asymptotic approximation for the\neffective motion of bumps. This yields a stochastic delay-differential equation\nwhere each delayed term arises from an interlaminar coupling.

The massless gauge field\nassociated with this symmetry, the dark photon, can interact via kinetic mixing\nwith the ordinary photon. In fact, such an interaction of strength $\\epsilon\n\\sim 10 ^{-9}$ appears to be necessary in order to explain galactic structure.\nWe calculate the effect of this new physics on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and its\ncontribution to the relativistic energy density at Hydrogen recombination. We\nthen examine the process of dark recombination, during which neutral dark\nstates are formed, which is important for large-scale structure formation.\nGalactic structure is considered next, focussing on spiral and irregular\ngalaxies. For these galaxies we modelled the dark matter halo (at the current\nepoch) as a dissipative plasma of dark matter particles, where the energy lost\ndue to dissipation is compensated by the energy produced from ordinary\nsupernovae (the core-collapse energy is transferred to the hidden sector via\nkinetic mixing induced processes in the supernova core).

We show that the SF order\nparameters obey the two-component nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLSE) with\nnot only cubic but also quintic nonlinearity in the vicinity of the first-order\ntransitions to the Mott insulators with even fillings. In the case of no BP, we\nanalyze solitary-wave (SW) solutions of the cubic-quintic NLSE. When the SF\nstate changes from a ground state to a metastable one, a standard dark SW turns\ninto a bubble-like dark SW, which has a non-vanishing density dip and no pi\nphase kink even in the case of a standing SW. It is shown that the former and\nlatter SW are dynamically unstable against an out-of-phase fluctuation and an\nin-phase fluctuation, respectively, and the dynamical instabilities are\nweakened when one approaches the transition point. We find that the size and\nthe inertial mass of the SW diverge at the first-order transition point. We\nsuggest that the divergence of the inertial mass may be detected through\nmeasurement of the relation between the velocity and the phase jump of the SW.\nIn the presence of BP, we reveal that when the barrier strength exceeds a\ncertain critical value, the SF state that was metastable without the barrier is\ndestabilized towards complete disjunction of the SF. The presence of the\ncritical BP strength indicates that the strong BP qualitatively changes the\ncriticality near the metastability limit of the SF state. We derive critical\nbehaviors of the density, the compressibility, and the critical current near\nthe metastability limit induced by the BP. It is also found that the relation\nbetween the supercurrent and the phase jump across the BP exhibits a peculiar\nbehavior, owing to the non-topological nature of the bubble-like SW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 08:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

A graphical study\npresents the differential cross section analyzing the forward/backward\nscattering (known also as glory scattering) and the polarization degree as\nfunctions of scattering angle. The graphical analysis shows the presence of\noscillations in scattering intensity around forward/backward directions,\nphenomena known as spiral scattering. The energy dependence of the differential\ncross section is also established by using analytical and graphical methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 10:01:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Oct 2014 12:25:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 10:25:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 14:50:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 14:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-02"}

Thus a measurement of the structure growth, e.g.,\nredshift-space distortions (RSD), can provide a powerful tool to constrain the\ninteracting dark energy (IDE) models. For the widely studied $Q=3\\beta\nH\\rho_{de}$ model, previous works showed that only a very small coupling\n($\\beta\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$) can survive in current RSD data. However, all\nthese analyses had to assume $w>-1$ and $\\beta>0$ due to the existence of the\nlarge-scale instability in the IDE scenario. In our recent work [Phys. Rev.

So we, for the first time, have the ability to explore the full\nparameter space of the IDE models. In this work, we reexamine the observational\nconstraints on the $Q=3\\beta H\\rho_{de}$ model within the PPF framework. By\nusing the Planck data, the baryon acoustic oscillation data, the JLA sample of\nsupernovae, and the Hubble constant measurement, we get\n$\\beta=-0.010^{+0.037}_{-0.033}$ ($1\\sigma$).

The error of $\\beta$ is substantially reduced with\nthe help of the RSD data.

Examples are\ngiven such as 18O + 184W and 16O + 148,152Sm where the expected rise above\nRutherford scattering due to Coulomb-nuclear interference is damped by coupling\nto the target excited states, and the extreme case of 11Li scattering, where\ncoupling to the 9Li + n + n continuum leads to an elastic scattering shape that\ncannot be reproduced by any standard optical model parameter set. The recent\navailability of high quality 6He, 11Li and 11Be data provides further examples\nof the influence that coupling effects can have on elastic scattering.\nConditions for strong projectile-target coupling effects are presented with\nspecial emphasis on the importance of the beam-target charge combination being\nlarge enough to bring about the strong coupling effects. Several measurements\nare proposed that can lead to further understanding of strong coupling effects\nby both inelastic excitation and nucleon transfer on near-barrier elastic\nscattering.

The output Gaussian quantum discord can be higher than the\ninitial Gaussian quantum discord when optimal gain of the classical channel and\nthe ancillary state are chosen. The physical reason for this result comes from\nthe fact that the quantum discord of an asymmetric Gaussian quantum discordant\nstate can be higher than that of a symmetric one.

Our simulations show that the required\nmeasurements will be possible with the European Extremely Large Telescope\n(E-ELT). The first method relies on mutual planet-moon events during stellar\ntransits. Eclipses with the moon passing behind (in front of) the planet will\nbe late (early) with regard to the moon's mean orbital period due to the finite\nspeed of light. This \"transit timing dichotomy\" (TTD) determines an exomoon's\nSOM with respect to the circumstellar motion. For the ten largest moons in the\nsolar system, TTDs range between 2 and 12 s. The E-ELT will enable such\nmeasurements for Earth-sized moons around nearby stars. The second method\nmeasures distortions in the IR spectrum of the rotating giant planet when it is\ntransited by its moon. This Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (RME) in the planetary\nspectrum reveals the angle between the planetary equator and the moon's\ncircumplanetary orbital plane, and therefore unveils the moon's SOM with\nrespect to the planet's rotation. A reasonably large moon transiting a directly\nimaged planet like beta Pic b causes an RME amplitude of almost 100 m/s, about\ntwice the stellar RME amplitude of the transiting exoplanet HD209458b.

No work has looked at what\nhappens after exposure, particularly how individuals react to such exposure,\nthough. Users might well be exposed to diverse articles but share only the\npartisan ones. To test this, we study partisan sharing on Facebook: the\ntendency for users to predominantly share like-minded news articles and avoid\nconflicting ones. We verified four main hypotheses. That is, whether partisan\nsharing: 1) exists at all; 2) changes across individuals (e.g., depending on\ntheir interest in politics); 3) changes over time (e.g., around elections); and\n4) changes depending on perceived importance of topics. We indeed find strong\nevidence for partisan sharing. To test whether it has any consequence in the\nreal world, we built a web application for BBC viewers of a popular political\nprogram, resulting in a controlled experiment involving more than 70\nindividuals. Based on what they share and on survey data, we find that partisan\nsharing has negative consequences: distorted perception of reality.

The\npresent orientation of the ring is consistent with an edge-on geometry in 2008,\nthus providing a simple explanation for the dimming of Chariklo's system\nbetween 1997 and 2008, and for the gradual disappearance of ice and other\nabsorption features in its spectrum over the same period.

Using satellite-derived continuous forest cover change\ndata, we examined national socioeconomic, demographic, and agricultural\nproduction data, and local demographic and geographic variables to assess\nmultilevel forces driving significant local forest cover loss and gain outside\nprotected areas during the first decade of this century. Because the processes\nthat drive forest cover loss and gain are expected to be different, we\nconstructed models of change in each direction. Although forest cover change\nvaried by country, national level population change was the strongest driver of\nforest loss rate for all countries, with a population doubling predicted to\ncause 2.06 percent annual cover loss, while doubling tea production was\npredicted to cause 1.90 percent. The rate of forest cover gain was associated\npositively with increased production of the local staple crop cassava, but\nnegatively with local population density and meat production, suggesting\nproduction drivers at multiple levels mitigate reforestation. We found a small,\nbut significant, decrease of forest cover loss rate with increasing distance\nfrom protected areas, supporting studies suggesting higher rates of landscape\nchange near protected areas. While local population density mitigated the rate\nof forest cover gain, cover loss also correlated to lower local population\ndensity, an apparent paradox, but consistent with findings that larger scale\nforces outweigh local drivers of deforestation. This implicates demographic and\nmarket forces at national and international scales as critical drivers of\nchange, calling into question the necessary scale of forest protection policy\nin this biodiversity hotspot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 14:50:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 22:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

While density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations can provide valuable insight about these\ninteractions, traditional DFT approaches with local exchange-correlation\nfunctionals suffer from a poor description of non-bonding van der Waals (vdW)\ninteractions. We examine here the contribution of vdW forces to the interaction\nof small organic molecules (methane, methanol, formic acid and glycine) with\nthe TiO2 (110) surface, based on DFT calculations with the optB88-vdW\nfunctional. The adsorption geometries and energies at different configurations\nwere also obtained in the standard generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE)\nfor comparison. We find that the optB88-vdW consistently gives shorter surface\nadsorbate-to-surface distances and slightly stronger interactions than PBE for\nthe weak (physisorbed) modes of adsorption. In the case of strongly adsorbed\n(chemisorbed) molecules both functionals give similar results for the\nadsorption geometries, and also similar values of the relative energies between\ndifferent chemisorption modes for each molecule. In particular both functionals\npredict that dissociative adsorption is more favourable than molecular\nadsorption for methanol, formic acid and glycine, in general agreement with\nexperiment. The dissociation energies obtained from both functionals are also\nvery similar, indicating that vdW interactions do not affect the thermodynamics\nof surface deprotonation. However, the optB88-vdW always predicts stronger\nadsorption than PBE. The comparison of the methanol adsorption energies with\nvalues obtained from a Redhead analysis of temperature programmed desorption\ndata suggests that optB88-vdW significantly overestimates the adsorption\nstrength, although we warn about the uncertainties involved in such\ncomparisons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 15:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

These methods lead to an estimate of the integral of the reliability\nfunction.\n  Here, we address the problem of directly calculating the data loss\nprobability for general repair and failure duration distributions. A closed\nlimiting form is developed for the probability of data loss and it is shown\nthat the probability of the event that a repair duration exceeds a failure\nduration is sufficient for characterizing the data loss probability.\n  For the case of constant repair duration, we develop an expression for the\nconditional data loss probability given the number of failures experienced by a\neach node in a given time window.

Here\nwe demonstrate an alternative route, which achieves fully localised zero-energy\nMajorana bound states when a topologically trivial superconductor is strongly\ncoupled to a helical normal region. Such a junction can be experimentally\nrealised by e.g. proximitizing a finite section of a nanowire with spin-orbit\ncoupling, and combining electrostatic depletion and a Zeeman field to drive the\nnon-proximitized (normal) portion into a helical phase. Majorana zero modes\nemerge in such an open system without fine-tuning as a result of\ncharge-conjugation symmetry, and can be ultimately linked to the existence of\n`exceptional points' (EPs) in parameter space, where two quasibound Andreev\nlevels bifurcate into two quasibound Majorana zero modes.

(ii) A search strategy to optimize the measure over the\nsubset space in a reasonable amount of time. In this article mutual information\nbetween features and class labels is considered to be the measure function. Two\nseries expansions for mutual information are proposed, and it is shown that\nmost heuristic criteria suggested in the literature are truncated\napproximations of these expansions. It is well-known that searching the whole\nsubset space is an NP-hard problem.

The first generalization is one where the strength of\ninfluence depends on the distance of the agents' opinions. Under this setup, we\nidentify conditions under which the opinions converge in finite time, and\nprovide a qualitative characterization of the equilibrium. We interpret the HK\nmodel opinion update rule as a quadratic cost-minimization rule. This enables a\nsecond generalization: a family of update rules which possess different\nequilibrium properties. Subsequently, we investigate models in which a external\nforce can behave strategically to modulate/influence user updates. We consider\ncases where this external force can introduce additional agents and cases where\nthey can modify the cost structures for other agents. We describe and analyze\nsome strategies through which such modulation may be possible in an\norder-optimal manner. Our simulations demonstrate that generalized dynamics\ndiffer qualitatively and quantitatively from traditional HK dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 14:10:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-29"}

The methodology can be used by team\nmanagers in identifying deficiencies in the present composition of the team and\nanalyzing player trades and acquisitions.

However, in engineering problems,\nfunctions of interest are often real-valued and thus not analytic, such as the\nstandard cost function. The HR calculus is a convenient way to calculate formal\nderivatives of both analytic and non-analytic functions of quaternion\nvariables, however, both the HR and other functional calculus in quaternion\nanalysis have encountered an essential technical obstacle, that is, the\ntraditional product rule is invalid due to the non- commutativity of the\nquaternion algebra. To address this issue, a generalized form of the HR\nderivative is proposed based on a general orthogonal system. The so introduced\ngeneralization, called the generalized HR (GHR) calculus, encompasses not just\nthe left- and right-hand versions of quaternion derivative, but also enables\nsolutions to some long standing problems, such as the novel product rule, the\nchain rule, the mean-valued theorem and Taylor's theorem. At the core of the\nproposed approach is the quaternion rotation, which can naturally be applied to\nother functional calculi in non-commutative settings. Examples on using the GHR\ncalculus in adaptive signal processing support the analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 01:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

The transition rates follow the Arrhenius equation with an activation\nenergy that depends on the grain mass. We show that the activation parameter\ncan be absorbed in the initial conditions for the grain masses, and that the\ntotal mass is conserved. We obtain numerical solutions of the coupled,\nnonlinear, ordinary differential equations of mass exchange for the two-grain\nsystem, and we compare them with approximate theoretical solutions in specific\nneighborhoods of the phase space. Using phase plane methods, we determine that\nthe system exhibits regimes of diffusive and growth-decay (reverse diffusion)\nkinetics. The equilibrium states are determined by the mass equipartition and\nseparation nullcline curves. If the transfer rates are perturbed by white\nnoise, numerical simulations show that the system still exhibits diffusive and\ngrowth-decay regimes, although the noise can reverse the sign of equilibrium\nmass difference. Finally, we present theoretical analysis and numerical\nsimulations of a system with many interacting grains. Diffusive and\ngrowth-decay regimes are established as well, but the approach to equilibrium\nis considerably slower.
