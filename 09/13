In this paper, we demonstrate that electrostatics can be\nused as a tool to manipulate the shape of soft, closed membranes by tuning\nenvironmental conditions such as the electrolyte concentration in the medium.\nUsing a molecular dynamics-based simulated annealing procedure, we investigate\ncharged elastic shells that do not exchange material with their environment,\nsuch as elastic membranes formed in emulsions or synthetic nanocontainers.

Shape changes are accompanied by a\nsignificant lowering of the electrostatic energy and a rise in the surface area\nof the shell. To substantiate our simulation findings, we show analytically\nthat a uniformly charged disc has a lower Coulomb energy than a sphere of the\nsame volume. Further, we test the robustness of our results by including the\neffects of charge renormalization in the analysis of the shape transitions and\nfind the latter to be feasible for a wide range of shell volume fractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 16:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-15"}

The aim of this work is, precisely in this direction, to\nstudy the relations of IT with International Migration (IM) and Foreign Direct\nInvestments (FDI).

Band insulators and superfluids are,\nhowever, fundamentally different: while the former exist in the absence of\ninter-particle interactions, the latter are broken symmetry states that owe\ntheir very existence to such interactions. In particular, unlike the static\nenergy gap of a band insulator, the gap in a superfluid is due to a dynamical\norder parameter that is subject to both thermal and quantum fluctuations. In\nthis work, we explore the consequences of bulk quantum fluctuations of the\norder parameter in the $B$ phase of superfluid $^3$He on the topologically\nprotected Majorana surface states. Neglecting the high-energy amplitude modes,\nwe find that one of the three spin-orbit Goldstone modes in $^3$He-$B$ couples\nto the surface Majorana fermions. This coupling in turn induces an effective\nshort-range two-body interaction between the Majorana fermions, with coupling\nconstant inversely proportional to the strength of the nuclear dipole-dipole\ninteraction in bulk $^3$He. A mean-field theory estimate of the value of this\ncoupling suggests that the surface Majorana fermions in $^3$He-$B$ are in the\nvicinity of a quantum phase transition to a gapped time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 20:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

Since an individual mass measurement\nis only possible for a relatively small number of objects it is crucial to have\nrobust and well understood scaling relations that relate the total mass to\neasily observable quantities. The main goal of this work is to constrain the\ngalaxy group scaling relations corrected for selection effects, and to quantify\nthe influence of non-gravitational physics at the low-mass regime. We analyzed\nXMM-Newton observations for a complete sample of galaxy groups selected from\nthe ROSAT All-Sky Survey and we compared the derived scaling properties with a\ngalaxy cluster sample. To investigate the role played by the different\nnon-gravitational processes we then compared the observational data with the\npredictions of hydrodynamical simulations. After applying the correction for\nselection effects (e.g. Malmquist bias) the L-M relation is steeper than the\nobserved one. Its slope is also steeper than the value obtained by using the\nmore massive systems of the HIFLUGCS sample. This behaviour can be explained by\na gradual change of the true L-M relation which should be taken into account\nwhen converting the observational parameters into masses. The other observed\nscaling relations (not corrected for selection biases) do not show any break\nalthough the comparison with the simulations suggests that feedback processes\nplay an important role in the formation and evolution of galaxy groups.

If chameleon particles exist, they can be produced in the sun\nand detected on Earth exploiting the equivalent of a radiation pressure. Since\ntheir effective mass scales with the local matter density, chameleons can be\nreflected by a dense medium if their effective mass becomes greater than their\ntotal energy. Thus, under appropriate conditions, a flux of solar chameleons\nmay be sensed by detecting the total instantaneous momentum transferred to a\nsuitable opto-mechanical force/pressure sensor.

Numerous initialization methods have\nbeen proposed to address this drawback. Many of these methods, however, have\ntime complexity superlinear in the number of data points, which makes them\nimpractical for large data sets.

The\nunderstanding of long range topological order in these systems is built around\nthe idea of a Berry connection, which is a gauge connection obtained from the\nphase of the electron wave function transported over momentum space rather than\ncoordinate space. The phase of a closed Wilson loop of the Berry connection\naround the Brillouin zone defines a topological order parameter which labels\ndiscrete flux vacua. The conducting states are surface modes on the domain\nwalls between discrete vacua. Evidence from large-$N_c$ chiral dynamics,\nholographic QCD, and Monte Carlo observations has pointed to a picture of the\nQCD vacuum that is very similar to that of a topological insulator, with\ndiscrete quasivacua labelled by $\\theta$ angles that differ by mod $2\\pi$. In\nthis picture, the domain walls are membranes of Chern-Simons charge, and the\nquark condensate consists of surface modes on these membranes, which are\ndelocalized and thus support the long range propagation of Goldstone pions. The\nBerry phase in QED2 describes charge polarization of fermion-antifermion pairs,\nwhile in 4D QCD it describes the polarization of Chern-Simons membranes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 20:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}

The data from EUV/SXR\nmissions suggest that solar corona is a non-uniform environment structured into\nactive regions (AR) represented by bundles magnetic loops heated to\ntemperatures exceeding 5 MK. Any viable coronal heating model should be capable\nof reproducing EUV and SXR emission from coronal active regions well as dynamic\nactivity. Measurements of emission measures (EM) for ARs provide clues to time\ndependence of the heating mechanism: static versus impulsive. While static\nequilibrium coronal loop models are successful in reproducing SXR emission\nwithin an AR, they cannot adequately predict the bright EUV loops. Meantime,\nimpulsive heating is capable in reproducing both EUV and SXR loop emission. The\nmajor goal of this paper is to construct realistic synthetic EM images of\nspecific solar corona active region, AR 11117 by using our 1D fully non-linear\ntime-dependent single-fluid hydrodynamic code. We first construct a magnetic\nskeleton for the entire active region using the HMI/SDO magnetogram for AR\n11117 and populate magnetic field lines with plasma. We then parametrically\nspecify impulsive heating of individual strands (flux tubes) comprising coronal\nloops. Next, we simulated the response of the entire active region (with LOS\nprojection effects) to the heating function (volumetric heating rate) scaled\nwith magnetic field and spatial scale parameters and find the best match\nbetween synthetic and actual (reconstructed) DEMs obtained by SDO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 21:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the topological invariant of\nthe plateau state can be read out from a generalized Streda formula and the\nspin-flip excitation spectrum exhibits a similar structure of the Hofstadter's\nbutterfly spectrum for the two-dimensional quantum Hall system on a lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Sep 2014 01:30:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 09:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-18"}

In this respect, therefore,\nmost of the existing methods simply discard detected outliers and pay little or\nno attention to employing them as an important source of information for motion\nestimation. We consider outliers as important as inliers for object tracking\nand propose a motion estimation algorithm based on concurrent tracking of\ninliers and outliers. Our tracker makes use of pyramidal implementation of the\nLucas-Kanade tracker to estimate motion flows of inliers and outliers and final\ntarget motion is estimated robustly based on both of these information.\nExperimental results from challenging benchmark video sequences confirm\nenhanced tracking performance, showing highly stable target tracking under\nsevere occlusion compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed\nalgorithm runs at more than 100 frames per second even without using a hardware\naccelerator, which makes the proposed method more practical and portable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Sep 2014 05:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}

Based\non the data it receives from multiple antennas, the fusion center formulates a\nmatrix, which, in conjunction with standard array processing schemes, such as\nMUSIC, leads to target detection and parameter estimation. In MIMO radars with\ncompressive sensing (MIMO-CS), the data matrix is formulated by each receive\nnode forwarding a small number of compressively obtained samples. In this\npaper, it is shown that under certain conditions, in both sampling cases, the\ndata matrix at the fusion center is low-rank, and thus can be recovered based\non knowledge of a small subset of its entries via matrix completion (MC)\ntechniques. Leveraging the low-rank property of that matrix, we propose a new\nMIMO radar approach, termed, MIMO-MC radar, in which each receive node either\nperforms matched filtering with a small number of randomly selected dictionary\nwaveforms or obtains sub-Nyquist samples of the received signal at random\nsampling instants, and forwards the results to a fusion center.
