The posterior probability is factored into (or\nproportional to) a conditional likelihood of the intensity values and a prior\nprobability of label configuration.

The parameters of these MRF models are\nlearned from labeled examples. During testing, an MRF inference technique,\nnamely Iterated Conditional Mode (ICM), produces the optimal label for each\npixel.

In the limit of low bottom\nfriction, classical theory of geostrophic turbulence predicts an inverse\ncascade of kinetic energy in the horizontal with condensation at the domain\nscale and barotropization on the vertical. By contrast, in the limit of large\nbottom friction, the flow is dominated by ribbons of high kinetic energy in the\nupper layer. These ribbons correspond to meandering jets separating regions of\nhomogenized potential vorticity. We interpret these result by taking advantage\nof the peculiar conservation laws satisfied by this system: the dynamics can be\nrecast in such a way that the imposed mean flow appears as an initial source of\npotential vorticity levels in the upper layer. The initial baroclinic\ninstability leads to a turbulent flow that stirs this potential vorticity field\nwhile conserving the global distribution of potential vorticity levels.\nStatistical mechanical theory of the 1-1/2 layer quasi-geostrophic model\npredict the formation of two regions of homogenized potential vorticity\nseparated by a minimal interface. We show that the dynamics of the ribbons\nresults from a competition between a tendency to reach this equilibrium state,\nand baroclinic instability that induces meanders of the interface. These\nmeanders intermittently break and induce potential vorticity mixing, but the\ninterface remains sharp throughout the flow evolution. We show that for some\nparameter regimes, the ribbons act as a mixing barrier which prevent relaxation\ntoward equilibrium, favouring the emergence of multiple zonal jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 17:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Important decisions in\npolitical, social and many other aspects of modern human life are being made\nusing location data. Decision makers in many countries are exploiting spatial\ndatabases for collecting information, analyzing them and planning for the\nfuture.

The presence of longitudinal microstructures (microbunching) in the\nelectron beam or the leading edge spikes can result in strong, spatially\nlocalized coherent enhancements of optical transition radiation (COTR) that\nmask the actual beam profile. Several efforts on mitigation of the effects in\nthe diagnostics task have been identified. At ASTA we have designed the beam\nprofiling stations to have mitigation features based on spectral filtering,\nscintillator choice, and the timing of the trigger to the digital camera's CCD\nchip. Since the COTR is more intense in the NIR than UV we have selectable\nbandpass filters centered at 420 nm which also overlap the spectral emissions\nof the LYSO:Ce scintillators. By delaying the CCD trigger timing of the\nintegration window by 40-50 ns, we can reject the prompt OTR signal and\nintegrate on the delayed scintillator light predominately.

However, conclusive evidence for\ndisks has remained elusive for the most massive young objects. This is mainly\ndue to significant observational challenges. Incisive studies, even targeting\nindividual objects, are therefore relevant to the progression of the field. NGC\n3603 IRS 9A* is a young massive stellar object still surrounded by an envelope\nof molecular gas. Previous mid-infrared observations with long-baseline\ninterferometry provided evidence for a disk of 50 mas diameter at its core.\nThis work aims at a comprehensive study of the physics and morphology of IRS 9A\nat near-infrared wavelengths. New sparse aperture masking interferometry data\ntaken with NACO/VLT at Ks and Lp filters were obtained and analysed together\nwith archival CRIRES spectra of the H2 and BrG lines. The calibrated\nvisibilities recorded at Ks and Lp bands suggest the presence of a partially\nresolved compact object of 30 mas at the core of IRS 9A, together with the\npresence of over-resolved flux. The spectroastrometric signal of the H2 line\nshows that this spectral feature proceeds from the large scale extended\nemission (300 mas) of IRS 9A, while the BrG line appears to be formed at the\ncore of the object (20 mas). This scenario is consistent with the brightness\ndistribution of the source for near- and mid-infrared wavelengths at various\nspatial scales. However, our model suffers from remaining inconsistencies\nbetween SED modelling and the interferometric data. Moreover, the BrG\nspectroastrometric signal indicates that the core of IRS 9A exhibits some form\nof complexity such as asymmetries in the disk. Future high-resolution\nobservations are required to confirm the disk/envelope model and to flesh out\nthe details of the physical form of the inner regions of IRS 9A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 18:22:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 19:54:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 14:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

We\nconnect objects across redshift with a simple constant-number-density\nprocedure, and choose a fiducial model with a relationship between BH and\ngalaxy growth rates that is linear and evolves in a simple way with redshift.\nWithin this fiducial model, we find the quasar luminosity function (QLF) by\ncalculating an \"intrinsic\" luminosity based on either the BH mass or BH growth\nrate, and then choosing a model of quasar variability with either a lognormal\nor truncated power-law distribution of instantaneous luminosities. This gives\nfour model variations, which we fit to the observed QLF at each redshift.

Our in-vivo study\nshows that the converted HARDI can be reconstructed by constrained spherical\ndeconvolution, and the fiber orientation distributions are consistent with\nthose from the original HARDI. We further illustrate that our scheme conversion\nmethod can be applied to HCP data, and the converted HARDI do not appear to\nsacrifice angular resolution.

The observed frequency is\n835.6440 +- 0.0002 Hz (1.43546 times the stellar spin frequency of 582.14323\nHz) and the modulation is well described by a sinusoid ( A + Bsin(p - p0) )\nwith fractional half-amplitude of B/A = 0.19 +- 0.04% (4-15 keV). The observed\nfrequency is consistent with the expected inertial frame frequency of a\nrotationally-modified surface g-mode, an interfacial mode in the ocean-crust\ninterface or perhaps an r-mode. Observing an inertial frame frequency--as\nopposed to a co-rotating frame frequency--appears consistent with the\nsuperburst's thermal emission arising from the entire surface of the neutron\nstar, and the mode may become visible by perturbing the local surface\ntemperature. We briefly discuss the implications of the mode detection for the\nneutron star's projected velocity and mass.

For\nthe first time, the electricity consumption at individual sites is available on\na near real-time basis. Efficient management of energy resources, electric\nutilities, and transmission grids, can be greatly facilitated by harnessing the\npotential of this data. The aim of this study is to generate probability\ndensity estimates for consumption recorded by individual smart meters. Such\nestimates can assist decision making by helping consumers identify and minimize\ntheir excess electricity usage, especially during peak times. For suppliers,\nthese estimates can be used to devise innovative time-of-use pricing strategies\naimed at their target consumers. We consider methods based on conditional\nkernel density (CKD) estimation with the incorporation of a decay parameter.\nThe methods capture the seasonality in consumption, and enable a nonparametric\nestimation of its conditional density. Using eight months of half-hourly data\nfor one thousand meters, we evaluate point and density forecasts, for lead\ntimes ranging from one half-hour up to a week ahead. We find that the\nkernel-based methods outperform a simple benchmark method that does not account\nfor seasonality, and compare well with an exponential smoothing method that we\nuse as a sophisticated benchmark. To gauge the financial impact, we use density\nestimates of consumption to derive prediction intervals of electricity cost for\ndifferent time-of-use tariffs. We show that a simple strategy of switching\nbetween different tariffs, based on a comparison of cost densities, delivers\nsignificant cost savings for the great majority of consumers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 19:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-10"}

We\nuse this difficulty to motivate the construction of \"deconstructed\" transverse\nmass variables which are designed preserve information on both the norm and\ndirection of the missing momentum. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these\nvariables in searches for the pair production of supersymmetric top-quark\npartners which subsequently decay into a final state with an isolated lepton,\njets and missing energy. We show that the use of deconstructed transverse mass\nvariables extends the accessible compressed spectra parameter space beyond the\nregion probed by traditional methods. The parameter space can further be\nexpanded to neutralino masses that are larger than the difference between the\nstop and top masses. In addition, we also discuss how these variables allow for\nnovel searches of single stop production, in order to directly probe\nunconstrained stealth stops in the small stop- and neutralino-mass regime. We\nalso demonstrate the utility of these variables for generic gluino and stop\nsearches in all-hadronic final states. Overall, we demonstrate that\ndeconstructed transverse variables are essential to any search wanting to\nmaximize signal separation from the background when the signal has undetected\nparticles in the final state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-08"}

We quantify this by\ndefining a \"synchronization timescale\" for galaxies as a function of mass and\nredshift that characterizes the extent to which different galaxies of a common\nmass are evolving in the same manner at various cosmic epochs. We measure this\nsynchronization timescale using 9 different star-forming galaxy observations\nfrom the literature and SDSS quasar observations spanning $0 < z \\lesssim 6$.\nSurprisingly, this synchronization timescale is a constant, approximately 1.5\nGyr for all combinations of mass and time. We also find that the ratio between\nthe stellar mass of galaxies turning off star formation and black hole mass of\nturnoff quasars is approximately 30:1, much lower than the 500:1 for quiescent\ngalaxies at low redshift. As a result, we propose a model in which the\nstar-forming \"main sequence\", analogous quasar behavior, and other observations\nform a galactic evolution \"main sequence\", in which star formation occurs\nearliest, followed by supermassive black hole accretion, and feedback between\nthe two are dominated by deterministic rather than stochastic processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 20:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In this article, we attempt to study the most\nprominent single-degenerate supersoft (WD + MS) channel when the rotation of\naccreting WDs is considered. We present a detailed binary population synthesis\nstudy to examine the predicted population of SNe Ia for this channel.

Only 2% have WD\nexplosion masses >2.0Msun; these require the initial WD mass to be larger than\n1.0 Msun.

We\nalso suggest that some SN Ia progenitors with substantial circumstellar\nhydrogen, including some apparent type IIn SNe, might be related to WDs which\nrequired support from differential rotation to avoid explosion, since these can\nstill be accreting from hydrogen-rich donors with a relatively high\nmass-transfer rate at the time of the SN explosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Sep 2014 20:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}

The\nmeasurements were carried out at the Advanced Light Source at an energy\nresolution of $\\Delta$E = 65 meV with additional measurements made at $\\Delta$E\n= 28 meV and 39 meV. Small resonance features below the ground-state ionization\nthreshold, at about 106 eV, are due to the presence of metastable Xe$^{7+}\n(4d^{10} 4f~^2{\\rm F}^{\\circ}_{5/2,7/2})$ ions in the ion beam. On the basis of\nthe accompanying theoretical calculations using the Dirac Atomic R-matrix Codes\n(DARC), an admixture of only a few percent of metastable ions in the parent ion\nbeam is inferred, with almost 100\\% of the parent ions in the $(4d^{10}5s\n~^2{\\rm S_{1/2}})$ ground level. The cross-section is dominated by a very\nstrong resonance associated with $4d \\rightarrow 5f$ excitation and subsequent\nautoionization.

In\nparticular, we propose an adaptive robust optimization model for multi-period\neconomic dispatch, and introduce the concept of dynamic uncertainty sets and\nmethods to construct such sets to model temporal and spatial correlations of\nuncertainty. We also develop a simulation platform which combines the proposed\nrobust economic dispatch model with statistical prediction tools in a rolling\nhorizon framework. We have conducted extensive computational experiments on\nthis platform using real wind data. The results are promising and demonstrate\nthe benefits of our approach in terms of cost and reliability over existing\nrobust optimization models as well as recent look-ahead dispatch models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 02:22:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 01:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

In\nthis work, we study the formation of mean motion resonance (MMR) systems,\nparticularly for the planetary configurations near 3:2 and 2:1 MMRs, and we\nconcentrate on the interplay between the resonant configuration and the\ncombination of stellar accretion rate, stellar magnetic field, speed of\nmigration and additional planets.

From the\nstatistical results, we find that under the formation scenario, the proportions\nnear 1.5 and 2.0 can reach 14.5% and 26.0%, respectively.

On the other hand, the lobes at the\ntermination of FSRQ jets lead to an effective \"equipartition\" between photons\nand ALPs due to its chaotic nature, thereby allowing us to make a clear-cut\nprediction.

Conventionally, automatic selection of this parameter is done through\neither statistical model selection (e.g., cross-validation, AIC, or BIC) or\nBayesian nonparametric models (e.g., hierarchical Dirichlet process). These\nmethods either rely on repeated runs of the inference algorithm to search\nthrough a large range of parameter values which does not suit the mining of big\ndata, or replace this parameter with alternative parameters that are less\nintuitive and still hard to be determined. In this paper, we explore to\n\"eliminate\" this parameter from a new perspective. We first present a\nnonparametric treatment of the PLSA model named nonparametric probabilistic\nlatent semantic analysis (nPLSA). The inference procedure of nPLSA allows for\nthe exploration and comparison of different numbers of topics within a single\nexecution, yet remains as simple as that of PLSA. This is achieved by\nsubstituting the parameter of the number of topics with an alternative\nparameter that is the minimal goodness of fit of a document. We show that the\nnew parameter can be further eliminated by two parameter-free treatments:\neither by monitoring the diversity among the discovered topics or by a weak\nsupervision from users in the form of an exemplar topic. The parameter-free\ntopic model finds the appropriate number of topics when the diversity among the\ndiscovered topics is maximized, or when the granularity of the discovered\ntopics matches the exemplar topic. Experiments on both synthetic and real data\nprove that the parameter-free topic model extracts topics with a comparable\nquality comparing to classical topic models with \"manual transmission\".

Metallicity drives the mass loss by stellar winds and\nsupernovae (SNe), with SCs losing more mass at high metallicity. We have\nsimulated three sets of initial conditions, with different initial relaxation\ntimescale. We find that the evolution of the half-mass radius of SCs depends on\nhow fast two-body relaxation is with respect to the lifetime of massive stars.\nIf core collapse is slow in comparison with stellar evolution, then mass loss\nby stellar winds and SNe is the dominant mechanism driving SC evolution, and\nmetal-rich SCs expand more than metal-poor ones. In contrast, if core collapse\noccurs on a comparable timescale with respect to the lifetime of massive stars,\nthen SC evolution depends on the interplay between mass loss and three-body\nencounters: dynamical heating by three-body encounters (mass loss by stellar\nwinds and SNe) is the dominant process driving the expansion of the core in\nmetal-poor (metal-rich) SCs. As a consequence, the half-mass radius of\nmetal-poor SCs expands more than that of metal-rich ones. We also find core\nradius oscillations, which grow in number and amplitude as metallicity\ndecreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 09:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Comparison of the experimental spectra with\ncalculations using the Tenti S6 model, developed in 1970s based on linearized\nkinetic equations for molecular gases, demonstrates that this model is valid to\nhigh accuracy. After previous measurements performed at 366 nm, the Tenti S6\nmodel is here verified for a second wavelength of 403 nm.

One of the main reasons for this has to do with the possible\npresence of inconsistencies, either internal within an experiment or external\nbetween different experiments. In order to assess the robustness of the global\nfit, different definitions of a conservative PDF set, that is, a PDF set based\non a maximally consistent dataset, have been introduced. However, these\napproaches are typically affected by theory biases in the selection of the\ndataset. In this contribution, after a brief overview of recent NNPDF\ndevelopments, we propose a new, fully objective, definition of a conservative\nPDF set, based on the Bayesian reweighting approach. Using the new NNPDF3.0\nframework, we produce various conservative sets, which turn out to be mutually\nin agreement within the respective PDF uncertainties, as well as with the\nglobal fit.

We\nassume that the unperturbed fixed point has two purely imaginary eigenvalues\nand a double zero one. It is well known that an one-parametric unfolding of the\ncorresponding Hamiltonian can be described by an integrable normal form. The\nnormal form has a normally elliptic invariant manifold of dimension two. On\nthis manifold, the truncated normal form has a separatrix loop. This loop\nshrinks to a point when the unfolding parameter vanishes. Unlike the normal\nform, in the original system the stable and unstable trajectories of the\nequilibrium do not coincide in general.

As a result\nof the large abundances of molecular hydrogen and atomic oxygen in these\nregions, the reaction H2 + O has been proposed to contribute significantly to\nthe formation of water as well. However, gas phase experiments and\ncalculations, as well as solid-phase experimental work contradict this\nhypothesis. Here, we use precisely executed temperature programmed desorption\n(TPD) experiments in an ultra-high vacuum setup combined with kinetic Monte\nCarlo simulations to establish an upper limit of the water production starting\nfrom H2 and O. These reactants are brought together in a matrix of CO2 in a\nseries of (control) experiments at different temperatures and with different\nisotopological compositions. The amount of water detected with the quadrupole\nmass spectrometer upon TPD is found to originate mainly from contamination in\nthe chamber itself. However, if water is produced in small quantities on the\nsurface through H2 + O, this can only be explained by a combined classical and\ntunneled reaction mechanism. An absolutely conservative upper limit for the\nreaction rate is derived with a microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo model that\nconverts the upper limit into a maximal possible reaction rate. Incorporating\nthis rate into simulations run for astrochemically relevant parameters, shows\nthat the upper limit to the contribution of the reaction H2 + O in OH, and\nhence water formation, is 11% in dense interstellar clouds. Our combined\nexperimental and theoretical results indicate however, that this contribution\nis likely to be much lower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 13:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-22"}

Unfortunately, many of these methods yield diverging descriptions of the\nsame network, making both the comparison and understanding of their results a\ndifficult challenge. A possible solution to this outstanding issue is to shift\nthe focus away from ad hoc methods and move towards more principled approaches\nbased on statistical inference of generative models. As a result, we face\ninstead the more well-defined task of selecting between competing generative\nprocesses, which can be done under a unified probabilistic framework. Here, we\nconsider the comparison between a variety of generative models including\nfeatures such as degree correction, where nodes with arbitrary degrees can\nbelong to the same group, and community overlap, where nodes are allowed to\nbelong to more than one group. Because such model variants possess an\nincreasing number of parameters, they become prone to overfitting. In this\nwork, we present a method of model selection based on the minimum description\nlength criterion and posterior odds ratios that is capable of fully accounting\nfor the increased degrees of freedom of the larger models, and selects the best\none according to the statistical evidence available in the data. In applying\nthis method to many empirical unweighted networks from different fields, we\nobserve that community overlap is very often not supported by statistical\nevidence and is selected as a better model only for a minority of them. On the\nother hand, we find that degree correction tends to be almost universally\nfavored by the available data, implying that intrinsic node proprieties (as\nopposed to group properties) are often an essential ingredient of network\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 13:17:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 15:40:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Jan 2015 17:31:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 10:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-27"}

In this paper, analytical expressions for\nthe shape factor for a rectangular and an elliptical vacuum chamber as a\nfunction of longitudinal position along the circumference in a storage ring are\nderived using an approach in which the position of electrons at the focusing\nquadrupole is transformed to the location of defocusing quadrupole and vice\nversa to define the parts of the vacuum chamber, where the loss of electrons\ntakes place at the location of quadrupoles.

Two of them are the most common,\nthe static form and the cosmological (exponentially expanding) form. The\nstaticity and non-stationarity of these two different forms are traced back to\nthe noncomoving and comoving nature of the corresponding coordinate systems. In\nthis paper using the quasi-Maxwell form of the Einstein field equations and a\ndefinition of static spacetimes based upon them, we look at these two different\nforms of the same solution from a new perspective which classifies them as a\nspecial case in a general one-parameter family of solutions. Specifically it is\nproved that, {\\it irrespective of the spacetime symmetry, a one-element perfect\nfluid in any frame noncomoving with the fluid could be the source of a static\nspacetime, only if its equation of state is that of a dark fluid namely $p =\n-\\rho = const.$}. These static solutions, which include the well-known de\nSitter spacetime, are called de Sitter-type spacetimes. To exemplify we\nconsider static axially and cylindrically symmetric de Sitter-type spacetimes\nand their dynamic (cosmological) versions. It is shown how despite the\nseemingly natural expectation based on the presence of $\\Lambda$ as their only\nparameter, the nonspherical expansions of these genuinely different solutions\nshould be expected indeed. To the best of our knowledge the dynamic version of\nthe cylindrically symmetric de Sitter-type spacetime is introduced here for the\nfirst time. Finally it is noted that the identification of the geometric term\n$\\Lambda g_{ij}$ with a perfect fluid with equation of state $p = -\\rho =\nconst.$, although mathematically consistent, obscures the crucial role of the\n(dark) fluid's velocity in defining a preferred (comoving) coordinate system in\nde Sitter-type spacetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 13:43:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jan 2015 09:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 11:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

Thus the question arises,\nwhat influence the orientation of the network has on the network flow over time\nproblem that is being solved on the oriented network. In the literature, this\nis also referred to as the contraflow or lane reversal problem.\n  We introduce and analyze the price of orientation: How much flow is lost in\nany orientation of the network if the time horizon remains fixed? We prove that\nthere is always an orientation where we can still send $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the\nflow and this bound is tight. For the special case of networks with a single\nsource or sink, this fraction is $\\frac12$ which is again tight.

We study two cases with battery-free\nand battery-deployed wireless nodes.

The so determined properties of the simulated distribution\ncan give useful hints about the behavior of the real prime number distribution.\nIn principle it could be also possible to demonstrate open questions in number\ntheory, proven the total equivalence of the simulated and real distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 15:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2014 13:17:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 14:26:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 3 Oct 2014 14:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-06"}

During the first very successful running period in 2010--2013, the LHC\nwas routinely storing protons at 3.5--4 TeV with a total beam energy of up to\n146 MJ, and even higher stored energies are foreseen in the future. This puts\nextraordinary demands on the control of beam losses. An un-controlled loss of\neven a tiny fraction of the beam could cause a superconducting magnet to\nundergo a transition into a normal-conducting state, or in the worst case cause\nmaterial damage. Hence a multi-stage collimation system has been installed in\norder to safely intercept high-amplitude beam protons before they are lost\nelsewhere. To guarantee adequate protection from the collimators, a detailed\ntheoretical understanding is needed. This article presents results of numerical\nsimulations of the distribution of beam losses around the LHC that have leaked\nout of the collimation system. The studies include tracking of protons through\nthe fields of more than 5000 magnets in the 27 km LHC ring over hundreds of\nrevolutions, and Monte-Carlo simulations of particle-matter interactions both\nin collimators and machine elements being hit by escaping particles. The\nsimulation results agree typically within a factor 2 with measurements of beam\nloss distributions from the previous LHC run. Considering the complex\nsimulation, which must account for a very large number of unknown\nimperfections, and in view of the total losses around the ring spanning over 7\norders of magnitude, we consider this an excellent agreement. Our results give\nconfidence in the simulation tools, which are used also for the design of\nfuture accelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 15:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-11"}

In realistic scenarios, channel sensing\noccurs with possible errors due to miss-detections and false alarms. As another\nchallenge, time-varying fading conditions in the channel between the secondary\ntransmitter and the secondary receiver have to be learned via channel\nestimation. In this paper, performance of causal channel estimation methods in\ncorrelated cognitive radio channels under imperfect channel sensing results is\nanalyzed, and achievable rates under both channel and sensing uncertainty are\ninvestigated. Initially, cognitive radio channel model with channel sensing\nerror and channel estimation is described. Then, using pilot symbols, minimum\nmean square error (MMSE) and linear-MMSE (L-MMSE) estimation methods are\nemployed at the secondary receiver to learn the channel fading coefficients.\nExpressions for the channel estimates and mean-squared errors (MSE) are\ndetermined, and their dependencies on channel sensing results, and pilot symbol\nperiod and energy are investigated. Since sensing uncertainty leads to\nuncertainty in the variance of the additive disturbance, channel estimation\nstrategies and performance are interestingly shown to depend on the sensing\nreliability. It is further shown that the L-MMSE estimation method, which is in\ngeneral suboptimal, performs very close to MMSE estimation. Furthermore,\nassuming the channel estimation errors and the interference introduced by the\nprimary users as zero-mean and Gaussian distributed, achievable rate\nexpressions of linear modulation schemes and Gaussian signaling are determined.\nSubsequently, the training period, and data and pilot symbol energy allocations\nare jointly optimized to maximize the achievable rates for both signaling\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 15:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-11"}

The resulting multipolar expansion of the flux of\ncosmic rays allows us to perform a series of anisotropy searches, and in\nparticular to report on the angular power spectrum of cosmic rays above\n$10^{19}$ eV. No significant deviation from isotropic expectations is found\nthroughout the analyses performed. Upper limits on the amplitudes of the dipole\nand quadrupole moments are derived as a function of the direction in the sky,\nvarying between 7% and 13% for the dipole and between 7% and 10% for a\nsymmetric quadrupole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 15:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-09"}

ARC is a 200-250\nMWe tokamak reactor with a major radius of 3.3 m, a minor radius of 1.1 m, and\nan on-axis magnetic field of 9.2 T. ARC has rare earth barium copper oxide\n(REBCO) superconducting toroidal field coils, which have joints to enable\ndisassembly. This allows the vacuum vessel to be replaced quickly, mitigating\nfirst wall survivability concerns, and permits a single device to test many\nvacuum vessel designs and divertor materials. The design point has a plasma\nfusion gain of Q_p~13.6, yet is fully non-inductive, with a modest bootstrap\nfraction of only ~63%. Thus ARC offers a high power gain with relatively large\nexternal control of the current profile. This highly attractive combination is\nenabled by the ~23 T peak field on coil with newly available REBCO\nsuperconductor technology. External current drive is provided by two innovative\ninboard RF launchers using 25 MW of lower hybrid and 13.6 MW of ion cyclotron\nfast wave power. The resulting efficient current drive provides a robust,\nsteady state core plasma far from disruptive limits. ARC uses an all-liquid\nblanket, consisting of low pressure, slowly flowing fluorine lithium beryllium\n(FLiBe) molten salt. The liquid blanket is low-risk technology and provides\neffective neutron moderation and shielding, excellent heat removal, and a\ntritium breeding ratio >= 1.1. The large temperature range over which FLiBe is\nliquid permits blanket operation at 900 K with single phase fluid cooling and a\nhigh-efficiency Brayton cycle, allowing for net electricity generation when\noperating ARC as a Pilot power plant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 10:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2015 15:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-18"}
