In IOCC, the\ninput space refers to RAU location space and output space refers to location\nspecific ergodic capacity space for noise-limited environments. Given a\nlocation-specific arbitrary desired ergodic capacity function over a\ngeographical area, we define the error as the difference between actual and\ndesired ergodic capacity. Our investigations show that i) the IOCC provides an\nupper bound to the cell averaged ergodic capacity error; and ii) the derived\nupper bound is equal to a weighted quantization error function in\nlocation-capacity space (input-output space) and iii) the upper bound can be\nmade arbitrarily small by a clustering process increasing the number of RAUs\nfor a feasible DAS. IOCC converts the RAU location problem into a codebook\ndesign problem in vector quantization in input-output space, and thus includes\nthe Squared Distance Criterion (SDC) for DAS in [15] (and other related papers)\nas a special case, which takes only the input space into account.

For all angles theta between an external magnetic field (H) and\nthe crystallographic c-axis, the application of H leads to the suppression of\nthe SDW-state through a 2^nd-order phase-transition at a theta-dependent\ncritical-field H_p(theta) leading to the observation of small Fermi surfaces\n(FSs) in the paramagnetic (PM) state.

We propose\nto apply it also to large dark matter halos where quantum effects are\nnegligible. We determine the caloric curve and study the thermodynamical\nstability of the different configurations. Equilibrium states exist only above\na critical energy $E_c$ in the microcanonical ensemble and only above a\ncritical temperature $T_c$ in the canonical ensemble. For $E<E_c$, the system\nundergoes a gravothermal catastrophe and, for $T<T_c$, it undergoes an\nisothermal collapse. We compute the profiles of density, circular velocity, and\nvelocity dispersion. We compare the prediction of the classical King model to\nthe observations of large dark matter halos. Because of collisions and\nevaporation, the central density increases while the slope of the halo density\nprofile decreases until an instability takes place. We show that large dark\nmatter halos are relatively well-described by the King model at, or close to,\nthe point of marginal microcanonical stability. At that point, the King model\ngenerates a density profile that can be approximated by the modified Hubble\nprofile.

To characterize how these consequences of adaptation depend\non the physical similarity between environments, we evolved 180 populations of\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae at different degrees of stress induced by either salt,\ntemperature, pH, or glucose depletion. We measure how the fitness of clones\nadapted to each environment depends on the intensity of the corresponding type\nof stress. We find that clones evolved in a given type and intensity of stress\ntend to gain fitness in other similar intensities of that stress, and lose\nprogressively more fitness in more physically dissimilar environments. These\nfitness trade-offs are asymmetric: adaptation to permissive conditions incurred\na smaller trade-off in stressful conditions than vice versa. We also find that\nfitnesses of clones are highly correlated across similar intensities of stress,\nbut these correlations decay towards zero in more dissimilar environments. To\ninterpret these results, we introduce the concept of a joint distribution of\nfitness effects of new mutations in multiple environments (the JDFE), which\ndescribes the probability that a given mutation has particular fitness effects\nin some set of conditions. We find that our observations are consistent with\nJDFEs that are highly correlated between physically similar environments, and\nthat become less correlated and asymmetric as the environments become more\ndissimilar. The JDFE provides a framework for quantifying evolutionary\nsimilarity between conditions, and forms a useful basis for theoretical work\naimed at predicting the outcomes of evolution in fluctuating environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Sep 2014 20:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-30"}

This distribution\nfunction takes into account the escape of high energy particles and has a\nfinite mass. On the other hand, the Pauli exclusion principle puts an upper\nbound on the phase space density of the system and stabilizes it against\ngravitational collapse. As a result, there exists a statistical equilibrium\nstate for any accessible values of energy and temperature. We plot the caloric\ncurves and investigate the nature of phase transitions as a function of the\ndegeneracy parameter in both microcanonical and canonical ensembles. We\nconsider stable and metastable states and emphasize the importance of the\nlatter for systems with long-range interactions. Phase transitions can take\nplace between a \"gaseous\" phase unaffected by quantum mechanics and a\n\"condensed\" phase dominated by quantum mechanics. The phase diagram exhibits\ntwo critical points, one in each ensemble, beyond which the phase transitions\ndisappear. There also exist a region of negative specific heats and a situation\nof ensemble inequivalence for sufficiently large systems. We apply the\nfermionic King model to the case of dark matter halos made of massive\nneutrinos. The gaseous phase describes large halos and the condensed phase\ndescribes dwarf halos. Partially degenerate configurations describe\nintermediate size halos. We argue that large dark matter halos cannot harbor a\nfermion ball because these nucleus-halo configurations are thermodynamically\nunstable (saddle points of entropy). Large dark matter halos may rather contain\na central black hole resulting from a dynamical instability of relativistic\norigin occurring during the gravothermal catastrophe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Sep 2014 20:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

We study a distributed reception scenario in which a\ntransmitter equipped with multiple antennas sends multiple streams via spatial\nmultiplexing to a large number of geographically separated single antenna\nreceive nodes. The receive nodes then quantize their received signals and\nforward the quantized received signals to a receive fusion center. With global\nchannel knowledge and forwarded quantized information from the receive nodes,\nthe fusion center attempts to decode the transmitted symbols. We assume the\ntransmit vector consists of phase shift keying (PSK) constellation points, and\neach receive node quantizes its received signal with one bit for each of the\nreal and imaginary parts of the signal to minimize the transmission overhead\nbetween the receive nodes and the fusion center. Fusing this data is a\nnon-trivial problem because the receive nodes cannot decode the transmitted\nsymbols before quantization. Instead, each receive node processes a single\nquantity, i.e., the received signal, regardless of the number of transmitted\nsymbols. We develop an optimal maximum likelihood (ML) receiver and a\nlow-complexity zero-forcing (ZF)-type receiver at the fusion center.

It\nconsists of three laws: (i) maximum $S$ (total spin), (ii) maximum $L$ (total\norbital angular momentum) under the constraint of (i), and (iii) the total\nangular momentum $J$ is $|L-S|$ for electron number less than half, while\n$J=L+S$ for more than half due to the relativistic spin-orbit interaction\n(SOI). In real systems, the electrons hop between the atoms and gain the\nitinerancy, which is usually described by the band theory. The whole content of\ntheories on correlation is to provide a reliable way to describe the\nintermediate situation between the two limits. Here we propose an approach\ntoward this goal, i.e., we study the two-atom systems of three $t_{2g}$\norbitals and see how the Hund's rule is modified by the transfer integral $t$\nbetween them. It is found that the competition between $t$ and the Hund's\ncoupling $J$ at each atom determines the crossover from the molecular orbital\nlimit to the strong correlation limit. Especially, the focus is on the\ngeneralization of the third rule, i.e., the inter-and intra-atomic SOI's in the\npresence of the correlation. We have found that there are cases where the\neffective SOI's are appreciably enhanced by the Hund's coupling. The conditions\nfor the enhancement are the intermediate Hund's coupling and the filling of\nfour or five electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Sep 2014 00:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-30"}

Due to the number of stars, the stellar\nand MSP winds mix efficiently within the GC. Such mixture of winds leaves GC\nand interacts with the galactic medium creating a bow shock nebula around GC.\nThe bow shock nebula is filled with relativistic leptons accelerated in the\npulsar magnetospheres and/or wind regions. We argue that nebulae around\nglobular clusters, immersed in relatively dense medium close to the galactic\nplane, should have complicated morphology due to interaction with the\nsurrounding gas. Therefore, TeV $\\gamma$-ray sources, related to these nebulae,\nare expected to be misaligned in respect to GC cores, as observed in the case\nof GC Ter 5. On the other hand, GCs in low density medium, i.e. far away from\nthe galactic disk, should produce bow shocks at large distances from the GC\ncores. The TeV $\\gamma$-ray sources around such nebulae are expected to be\nalmost spherical and centred on the GC cores.
