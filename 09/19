With their increasing coverage of the world's landmark\nbuildings and objects, Internet photo collections are now being used as a\nsource for building such systems in a fully automatic fashion. This process\ntypically consists of three steps: clustering large amounts of images by the\nobjects they depict; determining object names from user-provided tags; and\nbuilding a robust, compact, and efficient recognition index.

How can we best\nuse the resulting image clusters to recognize the object in a query? How can\nthe object be efficiently represented in memory for recognition? How reliably\ncan semantic information be extracted? And finally: What are the limiting\nfactors in the resulting pipeline from query to semantics?

SAME can\nbe viewed as cooling the posterior parameter distribution and allows annealed\nsearch for the MAP parameters, often yielding very high quality (lower loss)\nestimates. But it does so at the expense of additional samples per iteration\nand generally slower performance.

We demonstrate that the metal-rich ejecta in\nhomologous expansion still carry fingerprints of asymmetries at the beginning\nof the explosion, but the final metal distribution is massively affected by the\ndetailed progenitor structure.

The extent of radial mixing,\nglobal asymmetry of the metal-rich ejecta, RT-induced fragmentation of initial\nplumes to smaller-scale fingers, and maximal Ni and minimal H velocities do not\nonly depend on the initial asphericity and explosion energy (which determine\nthe shock and initial Ni velocities) but also on the density profiles and\nwidths of C+O core and He shell and on the density gradient at the He/H\ntransition, which lead to unsteady shock propagation and the formation of\nreverse shocks.

Gravitational perturbations from\nthe BH companion, on a much wider orbit, can cause the dark matter particle to\nreach extremely high eccentricities and even get accreted onto the BH, by what\nis known as the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. We show that this may\nproduce a torus-like configuration for the dark matter distribution around the\nless massive member of the BH binary. We first consider an Intermediate BH\n(IMBH) in the vicinity of our Galactic Center, which may be a relic of a past\nminor merger. We show that if the IMBH is close enough (i.e., near the stellar\ndisk) the EKL mechanism is very efficient in exciting the eccentricity of dark\nmatter particles in near-polar configurations to extremely high values where\nthey are accreted by the IMBH. We show that this mechanism is even more\neffective if the central BH grows in mass, where we have assumed adiabatic\ngrowth. Since near-polar configurations are disrupted, a torus-like shape is\nformed. We also show that this behavior is also likely to be relevant for\nSupermassive BH binaries. We suggest that if the BHs are spinning, the accreted\ndark matter particles may linger in the ergosphere and thereby may generate\nself-annihilations and produce an indirect signature of potential interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We further show that to get a non-zero\n$\\theta_K$ in a one-band spin-fluctuation scenario, in the absence of disorder,\none has to extend the spin-mediated interaction to momenta away from\n$(\\pi,\\pi)$ and has to include particle-hole asymmetry. Alternatively, in the\npresence of disorder one can get a non-zero $\\theta_K$ from impurity\nscattering: either due to skew scattering (with non-Gaussian disorder) or due\nto particle-hole asymmetry in case of Gaussian disorder. The impurity analysis\nin our case is similar to that in earlier works on Kerr effect in $p_x+ip_y$\nsuperconductor, however in our case the magnitude of $\\theta_K$ is enhanced by\nthe flattening of the Fermi surface in the \"hot\" regions which mostly\ncontribute to charge order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 20:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 22:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

For example, brain parcellation is often used for\ndefining the network nodes in connectivity studies. While inference has\ntraditionally been performed on group-level data, there is a growing interest\nin parcellating single subject data. However, this is difficult due to the low\nsignal-to-noise ratio of rsfMRI data, combined with typically short scan\nlengths. A large number of brain parcellation approaches employ clustering,\nwhich begins with a measure of similarity or distance between voxels. The goal\nof this work is to improve the reproducibility of single-subject parcellation\nusing shrinkage estimators of such measures, allowing the noisy\nsubject-specific estimator to \"borrow strength\" in a principled manner from a\nlarger population of subjects. We present several empirical Bayes shrinkage\nestimators and outline methods for shrinkage when multiple scans are not\navailable for each subject. We perform shrinkage on raw intervoxel correlation\nestimates and use both raw and shrinkage estimates to produce parcellations by\nperforming clustering on the voxels. Our proposed method is agnostic to the\nchoice of clustering method and can be used as a pre-processing step for any\nclustering algorithm. Using two datasets---a simulated dataset where the true\nparcellation is known and is subject-specific and a test-retest dataset\nconsisting of two 7-minute rsfMRI scans from 20 subjects---we show that\nparcellations produced from shrinkage correlation estimates have higher\nreliability and validity than those produced from raw estimates. Application to\ntest-retest data shows that using shrinkage estimators increases the\nreproducibility of subject-specific parcellations of the motor cortex by up to\n30%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 20:13:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 18:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-29"}

Gelation is induced by crossing the\ngas-liquid phase-separation line and the resulting rapid densification of the\ncolloid-rich phase leads to a sharp change in dynamics and local structure.\nThus, we find that gelation is first-order-like and can occur at much higher\ndensities than previously thought: far from being low-density networks, gels\nhave a clear \"thermodynamic\" definition which nevertheless leads to a\nnon-equilibrium state with a distinct local structure characteristic of a\nrapidly quenched glass.

The 56Ni freshly-produced\nin the supernova powers the optical light curve, as it emits gamma-rays upon\nits radioactive decay to 56Co and then 56Fe. Gamma-ray lines from 56Co decay\nare expected to become directly visible through the overlying white dwarf\nmaterial several weeks after the explosion, as they progressively penetrate the\noverlying material of the supernova envelope, diluted as it expands. The lines\nare expected to be Doppler-shifted or broadened from the kinematics of the 56Ni\nejecta. With the SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL and using an improved\ninstrumental background method, we detect the two main lines from 56Co decay at\n847 and 1238 keV from SN2014J at 3.3 Mpc, significantly Doppler-broadened, and\nat intensities (3.65+/-1.21) 10^-4 and (2.27+/-0.69) 10^-4 ph cm^-2s^-1,\nrespectively, at brightness maximum.

HCG\n57a has been previously shown to contain enhanced quantities of warm molecular\nhydrogen consistent with shock and/or turbulent heating. Our observations show\nthat HCG 57d has strong [C II] emission compared to L$_{\\rm FIR}$ and weak\nCO(1-0), while in HCG 57a, both the [C II] and CO(1-0) are strong. HCG 57a lies\nat the upper end of the normal distribution of [C II]/CO and [C II]/FIR ratios,\nand its far-IR cooling supports a low density warm diffuse gas that falls close\nto the boundary of acceptable PDR models. However, the power radiated in the [C\nII] and warm H$_2$ emission have similar magnitudes, as seen in other\nshock-dominated systems and predicted by recent models. We suggest that\nshock-heating of the [C II] is a viable alternative to photoelectric heating in\nviolently disturbed diffuse gas. The existence of shocks is also consistent\nwith peculiar CO kinematics in the galaxy, indicating highly non-circular\nmotions are present. These kinematically disturbed CO regions also show\nevidence of suppressed star formation, falling a factor of 10-30 below normal\ngalaxies on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. We suggest that the peculiar\nproperties of both galaxies are consistent with a highly dissipative off-center\ncollisional encounter between HCG 57d and 57a, creating ring-like morphologies\nin both systems. Highly dissipative gas-on-gas collisions may be more common in\ndense groups because of the likelihood of repeated multiple encounters. The\npossibility of shock-induced SF suppression may explain why a subset of these\nHCG galaxies have been found previously to fall in the mid-infrared green\nvalley.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 22:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We validated the DMD approach on\nsub-dural electrode array recordings from human subjects performing a known\nmotor activation task. Next, we leveraged DMD in combination with machine\nlearning to develop a novel method to extract sleep spindle networks from the\nsame subjects. We suggest that DMD is generally applicable as a powerful method\nin the analysis and understanding of large-scale recordings of neural activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 00:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

This occurs because the\nflat internal profile of rotation imposed at the Zero-Age MS (ZAMS) is modified\nby the action of meridional currents immediately after the ZAMS, causing the\nsurface rotational velocity to decrease abruptly until it reaches a\nquasi-stationary state. We compute stellar models with non-solid rotation at\nthe ZAMS to obtain stellar evolutionary tracks with a larger content of angular\nmomentum, that attain rotational equatorial velocities close to the critical\nlimit throughout their MS phase. These models have a longer MS lifetime and a\nhigher surface chemical enrichment already at the end of the MS, particularly\nat Z=0.002. Stellar models with solid rotation at the ZAMS adequately represent\nthe overall characteristics and evolution of differentially rotating models of\nidentical angular momentum content, but with a lower initial surface rotational\nvelocity. For these models we recommend to use as the initial rotational rate\nthe values derived once the quasi-stationary state is reached, after the abrupt\ndecrease in surface velocity. Interestingly, the initial equatorial rotational\nvelocities are virtually metallicity independent for the stellar models we\ncomputed with the same mass and angular momentum content at the ZAMS. If, as\nsome observational evidence indicates, B-type stars at Z=0.002 rotate with a\nhigher equatorial velocity at the ZAMS than stars with Z=0.014, our finding\nwould indicate that the angular momentum content of B-type stars in the SMC is\nhigher than their Galactic counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 08:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-08"}

We find that\nwithout the tunnel coupling between these paired MFs, quantum entanglement\ncannot be induced from an unentangled (i.e., product) state, but quantum\ndiscord is observed due to the intrinsic nonlocal correlations of the paired\nMFs. This finding reveals that quantum discord can indeed demonstrate the\nintrinsic non-locality of the MFs formed in the nanowire. Also, quantum discord\ncan be employed to discriminate the MFs from the regular fermions.

However, most of\nthe demotion schemes are statically performed on a limited number of\npre-selected low-power states, and are suboptimal for different workloads and\nmemory architectures. Even worse, the idle periods are often too short for\neffective power state transitions, especially for memory intensive\napplications.

The luminosity spectrum at photon\ncolliders is broad and has a rather sharp high-energy edge, which can be used,\nfor example, to measure the mass of the Higgs boson in the process gamma-gamma\nto H or masses of charged scalars by observing the cross-section threshold. In\naddition to the precise knowledge of the edge energy of the luminosity\nspectrum, it is even more important to have a way to calibrate the absolute\nenergy scale of the detector. At first sight, Compton scattering itself\nprovides a unique way to determine the beam energies and produce particles of\nknown energies that could be used for detector calibration. The energy scale is\ngiven by the electron mass m_e and laser photon energy \\omega_0. However, this\ndoes not work at realistic photon colliders due to large nonlinear effects in\nCompton scattering at the conversion region (\\xi^2 \\sim 0.3).

We investigate which constraints the Euclid mission can set on the MC\ncoefficients also taking into account degeneracies with the cosmological\nparameters. To this end, we first estimate the number of peaks and its redshift\ndistribution for different MC relations. We find that the steeper the mass\ndependence and the larger the normalisation, the higher is the number of\ndetectable clusters, with the total number of peaks changing up to $40\\%$\ndepending on the MC relation. We then perform a Fisher matrix forecast of the\nerrors on the MC relation parameters as well as cosmological parameters.

We find that the majority of Herschel-selected intermediate\nredshift (U)LIRGs have L_CII/L_FIR ratios that are a factor of about 10 higher\nthan that of local ULIRGs and comparable to that of local normal and high-$z$\nstar forming galaxies. Using our sample to bridge local and high-z [CII]\nobservations, we find that the majority of galaxies at all redshifts and all\nluminosities follow a L_CII-L_FIR relation with a slope of unity, from which\nlocal ULIRGs and high-z AGN dominated sources are clear outliers. We also\nconfirm that the strong anti-correlation between the L_CII/L_FIR ratio and the\nfar-IR color L_60/L_100 observed in the local Universe holds over a broad range\nof redshifts and luminosities, in the sense that warmer sources exhibit lower\nL_CII/L_FIR at any epoch. Intermediate redshift ULIRGs are also characterised\nby large molecular gas reservoirs and by lower star formation efficiencies\ncompared to that of local ULIRGs. The high L_CII/L_FIR ratios, the moderate\nstar formation efficiencies (L_LIR/L_CO or L_IR/M_gas) and the relatively low\ndust temperatures of our sample (which are also common characteristics of\nhigh-z star forming galaxies with ULIRG-like luminosities) indicate that the\nevolution of the physical properties of (U)LIRGs between the present day and z\n> 1 is already significant by z ~ 0.3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 11:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In the energy levels' spacing statistics,\nwe find evidence for a critical energy that separates delocalized eigenstates\nfrom states that are localized at pairs or clusters of atoms separated by less\nthan the typical nearest-neighbor distance. We argue that the dipole blockade\neffect in Rydberg gases can be leveraged to manipulate this transition across a\nwide range: As the blockade radius increases, the relative weight of localized\nstates is reduced. At the same time, the spectral statistics -- in particular,\nthe density of states and the nearest neighbor level spacing statistics --\nexhibits a transition from approximately a 1-stable L\\'evy to a Gaussian\northogonal ensemble. Deviations from random matrix statistics are shown to stem\nfrom correlations between interatomic interaction strengths that lead to an\nasymmetry of the spectral density and profoundly affect localization\nproperties. We discuss approximations to the self-consistent Matsubara-Toyozawa\nlocator expansion that incorporate these effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 12:31:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2014 22:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Partition functions are combinatorial in nature and\nquantifying their approximation complexity does not require a detailed\nunderstanding of quantum computation. Using combinatorial arguments, we give\nthe first full classification of the complexity of multiplicatively\napproximating the norm and additively approximating the argument of the Ising\npartition function for complex edge interactions (as well as of approximating\nthe partition function according to a natural complex metric).

In bad metals, such as many strongly correlated electron materials,\nthe resistivity exceeds the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit and the transport is\nincoherent in nature. Hartnoll, loosely motivated by holographic duality\n(AdS/CFT correspondence) in string theory, recently proposed a lower bound to\nthe charge diffusion constant, $D \\gtrsim \\hbar v_{F}^{2}/(k_{B}T)$, in the\nincoherent regime of transport, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity and $T$ the\ntemperature. Using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) we calculate the charge\ndiffusion constant in a single band Hubbard model at half filling.

Unfortunately, the required precision to extract\natmospheric information surpasses the design specifications of most general\npurpose instrumentation, resulting in instrumental systematics in the light\ncurves that are typically larger than the target precision. Systematics must\ntherefore be modelled, leaving the inference of light curve parameters\nconditioned on the subjective choice of models and model selection criteria.\nThis paper aims to test the reliability of the most commonly used systematics\nmodels and model selection criteria. As we are primarily interested in\nrecovering light curve parameters rather than the favoured systematics model,\nmarginalisation over systematics models is introduced as a more robust\nalternative than simple model selection. This can incorporate uncertainties in\nthe choice of systematics model into the error budget as well as the model\nparameters. Its use is demonstrated using a series of simulated transit light\ncurves. Stochastic models, specifically Gaussian processes, are also discussed\nin the context of marginalisation over systematics models, and are found to\nreliably recover the transit parameters for a wide range of systematics\nfunctions. None of the tested model selection criteria - including the BIC -\nroutinely recovered the correct model. This means that commonly used methods\nthat are based on simple model selection may underestimate the uncertainties\nwhen extracting transmission and eclipse spectra from real data, and\nlow-significance claims using such techniques should be treated with caution.\nIn general, no systematics modelling techniques are perfect; however,\nmarginalisation over many systematics models helps to mitigate poor model\nselection, and stochastic processes provide an even more flexible approach to\nmodelling instrumental systematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 14:21:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jan 2015 14:43:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2015 13:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-14"}

We propose a new class of\nage-activity relations that connects the Mt.

We interpret these logics in one-counter\ngame models which are infinite duration games played on finite control graphs\nwhere each transition can increase or decrease the value of an unbounded\ncounter. That is, the state-space of these games are, generally, infinite. We\nconsider the model-checking problem of the logics QATL and QATLs on one-counter\ngame models with VASS semantics for which we develop algorithms and provide\nmatching lower bounds. Our algorithms are based on reductions of the\nmodel-checking problems to model-checking games. This approach makes it quite\nsimple for us to deal with extensions of the logical languages as well as the\ninfinite state spaces. The framework generalizes on one hand qualitative\nproblems such as ATL/ATLs model-checking of finite-state systems,\nmodel-checking of the branching-time temporal logics CTL and CTLs on\none-counter processes and the realizability problem of LTL specifications. On\nthe other hand the model-checking problem for QATL/QATLs generalizes\nquantitative problems such as the fixed-initial credit problem for energy games\n(in the case of QATL) and energy parity games (in the case of QATLs). Our\nresults are positive as we show that the generalizations are not too costly\nwith respect to complexity. As a byproduct we obtain new results on the\ncomplexity of model-checking CTLs in one-counter processes and show that\ndeciding the winner in one-counter games with LTL objectives is\n2ExpSpace-complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 14:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-22"}

We derive new inequalities which are satisfied by all\nlocal correlations in this scenario, for the cases when the central party\nperforms (i) two dichotomic measurements (ii) a single Bell state measurement.\nWe demonstrate quantum violations of these inequalities and study both the\nrobustness to noise and to losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 15:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

Water is the ideal tracer of these effects\nbecause it is present in high abundance in various parts of the protostar.\nMethod: We present \\textit{Herschel} HIFI spectra of multiple water-transitions\ntowards 29 nearby Class 0/I protostars as part of the WISH Survey. These are\ndecomposed into different Gaussian components, with each related to one of\nthree parts of the protostellar system; quiescent envelope, cavity shock and\nspot shocks in the jet and at the base of the outflow. We then constrain the\nexcitation conditions present in the two outflow-related components. Results:\nWater emission is optically thick but effectively thin, with line ratios that\ndo not vary with velocity, in contrast to CO. The physical conditions of the\ncavity and spot shocks are similar, with post-shock H$_{2}$ densities of order\n10$^{5}-$10$^{8}$\\,cm$^{-3}$ and H$_{2}$O column densities of order\n10$^{16}-$10$^{18}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. H$_{2}$O emission originates in compact\nemitting regions: for the spot shocks these correspond to point sources with\nradii of order 10-200\\,AU, while for the cavity shocks these come from a thin\nlayer along the outflow cavity wall with thickness of order 1-30\\,AU.\nConclusions: Water emission at the source position traces two distinct\nkinematic components in the outflow; J shocks at the base of the outflow or in\nthe jet, and C shocks in a thin layer in the cavity wall. Class I sources have\nsimilar excitation conditions to Class 0 sources, but generally smaller\nline-widths and emitting region sizes. We suggest that it is the velocity of\nthe wind driving the outflow, rather than the decrease in envelope density or\nmass, that is the cause of the decrease in H$_{2}$O intensity between Class 0\nand I.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 15:42:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Oct 2014 15:31:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Jan 2015 10:12:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 12:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-13"}

Climate 26 (2013) 1387] proposed a model of\ntemperature-driven air redistribution to quantify the ratio between changes of\nsea level pressure $p_s$ and mean tropospheric temperature $T_a$ in the\ntropics. This model assumes that the height of the tropical troposphere is\nisobaric. Here problems with this model are identified. A revised relationship\nbetween $p_s$ and $T_a$ is derived governed by two parameters -- the isobaric\nand isothermal heights -- rather than just one. Further insight is provided by\nthe model of R S Lindzen and S Nigam [J. Atmos. Sci. 44 (1987) 2418], which was\nthe first to use the concept of isobaric height to relate tropical $p_s$ to air\ntemperature, and did this by assuming that isobaric height is always around 3\nkm and isothermal height is likewise near constant. Observational data,\npresented here, show that neither of these heights is spatially universal nor\ndo their mean values match previous assumptions. Analyses show that the ratio\nof the long-term changes in $p_s$ and $T_a$ associated with land-sea\ntemperature contrasts in a warming climate -- the focus of Bayr and Dommenget\n[2013] -- is in fact determined by the corresponding ratio of spatial\ndifferences in the annual mean $p_s$ and $T_a$. The latter ratio, reflecting\nlower pressure at higher temperature in the tropics, is dominated by meridional\npressure and temperature differences rather than by land-sea contrasts.\nConsiderations of isobaric heights are shown to be unable to predict either\nspatial or temporal variation in $p_s$. As noted by Bayr and Dommenget [2013],\nthe role of moisture dynamics in generating sea level pressure variation\nremains in need of further theoretical investigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 17:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-22"}

Given the good agreement\nbetween the two evaluations, the choice of evaluation will make little\ndifference for the modeling of spontaneous fission. However, we suggest that\nthe evaluation in LA-UR-05-0288 be adopted as the MCNP default because it also\nincludes recommended distributions for neutron induced fission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 16:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-09"}

In this paper, a particular public key cryptosystem\ncalled the ElGamal Cryptosystem is presented considered with the help MATLAB\nProgram to be used over Images. Since the ElGamal cryptosystem over a primitive\nroot of a large prime is used in messages encryption in the free GNU Privacy\nGuard software, recent versions of PGP, and other cryptosystems. This paper\nshows a modification of the this cryptosystem by applying it over gray and\ncolor images. That would be by transforming an image into its corresponding\nmatrix using MATLAB Program, then applying the encryption and decryption\nalgorithms over it. Actually, this modification gives one of the best image\nencryptions that have been used since the encryption procedure over any image\ngoes smoothly and transfers the original image to completely undefined image\nwhich makes this cryptosystem is really secure and successful over image\nencryption. As well as, the decryption procedure of the encrypted image works\nvery well since it transfers undefined image to its original. Therefore, this\nnew modification can make the cryptosystem of images more immune against some\nfuture attacks since breaking this cryptosystem depends on solving the discrete\nlogarithm problem which is really impossible with large prime numbers .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 15:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-31"}
