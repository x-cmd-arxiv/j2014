Mainly, the motivations for developing novel\nconditions came from the desire to carry over convergence rates results from\nthe Hilbert space setting to generalized Tikhonov regularization in Banach\nspaces. For instance, variational source conditions have been developed and\nthey were expected to be equivalent to standard source conditions for linear\ninverse problems in a Hilbert space setting. We show that this expectation does\nnot hold. However, in the standard Hilbert space setting these novel conditions\nare optimal, which we prove by using some deep results from Neubauer, and\ngeneralize existing convergence rates results. The key tool in our analysis is\na novel source condition, which we put into relation to the existing source\nconditions from the literature. As a positive by-product, convergence rates\nresults can be proven without spectral theory, which is the standard technique\nfor proving convergence rates for linear inverse problems in Hilbert spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 16:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-29"}

In doing so, we estimate the mismatch penalty\nbetween alternative aperiodic structures, above the glass transition; the\npenalty is equal to the typical magnitude of free energy fluctuations in the\nliquid. The resulting expressions for the activation barrier and the\ncooperativity length contain exclusively bulk, static properties; in their\nsimplest form they contains only the bulk modulus and the configurational\nentropy per unit volume. The expressions are universal in that they do not\ndepend explicitly on the molecular detail. The predicted values for the barrier\nand cooperativity length and, in particular, the temperature dependence of the\nbarrier are in satisfactory agreement with observation. We thus confirm that\nthe entropic droplet picture is indeed not only internally-consistent but is\nalso fully constructive, consistent with the apparent success of its many\nquantitative predictions.

This sequence of lower bounds is\ncomputed by solving increasingly larger-sized relative entropy optimization\nproblems, which are convex programs specified in terms of linear and relative\nentropy functions.

Since the brightness of this feature is routinely reported, together\nwith astrometry, by most comet observers as the \"nuclear magnitude,\" it is\nstraightforward to determine the onset time, a fundamental parameter of any\noutburst, by inspecting the chronological lists of such observations for a\nmajor jump in the nuclear brightness. Although it is inadmissible to mix\nnuclear magnitudes by different observers without first carefully examining\ntheir compatibility, the time constraints obtained from data sets reported by\ndifferent observers can readily be combined. The intersection of these sets\nprovides the tightest possible constraint on the outburst's onset time. Applied\nto comet 168P/Hergenrother during its 2012 return to perihelion, three\noutbursts were detected and their timing determined with good to excellent\naccuracy. Six fragmentation events experienced by the comet are shown to have\noccurred in the same period of time as the outbursts. Three companions are\nlikely to have broken off from the primary in the first outburst, two\ncompanions in the second outburst, and one companion in the last outburst. All\ncompanions were short-lived, belonging to the class of excessively brittle\nfragments. Yet, the results suggest that most of the mass lost in the first\noutburst remained relatively intact during the liftoff, while the opposite was\nthe case in the last outburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 17:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-29"}

Here we explore the possibility that the gradual accretion\nof exo-Oort cloud comets, which are a rich source of H, contributes to the\napparent increase of trace H with WD cooling age. We determine how often\nremnant exo-Oort clouds, freshly excited from post-main-sequence stellar mass\nloss, dynamically inject comets inside the WD's Roche radius. We improve upon\nprevious studies by considering a representative range of single WD masses\n(0.52-1.00 Solar masses) and incorporating different cloud architectures, giant\nbranch stellar mass loss, stellar flybys, Galactic tides and a realistic escape\nellipsoid in self-consistent numerical simulations that integrate beyond 8 Gyr\nages of WD cooling.

The Fornax field star population is dominated by intermediate age stars\nbut star formation was going on over almost its entire history. It has been\nproposed that Fornax experienced a minor merger event. Despite recent progress,\nonly the high metallicity end of Fornax field stars ([Fe/H]>-1.2 dex) has been\nsampled in larger number via high resolution spectroscopy. We want to better\nunderstand the full chemical evolution of this galaxy by better sampling the\nwhole metallicity range, including more metal poor stars. We use the VLT-FLAMES\nmulti-fibre spectrograph in high-resolution mode to determine the abundances of\nseveral alpha, iron-peak and neutron-capture elements in a sample of 47\nindividual Red Giant Branch stars in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We\ncombine these abundances with accurate age estimates derived from the age\nprobability distribution from the colour-magnitude diagram of Fornax. Similar\nto other dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the old, metal-poor stars of Fornax are\ntypically alpha-rich while the young metal-rich stars are alpha-poor. In the\nclassical scenario of the time delay between SNe II and SNe Ia, we confirm that\nSNe Ia started to contribute to the chemical enrichment at [Fe/H] between -2.0\nand -1.8 dex. We find that the onset of SNe Ia took place between 12-10 Gyrs\nago. The high values of [Ba/Fe], [La/Fe] reflect the influence of SNe Ia and\nAGB stars in the abundance pattern of the younger stellar population of Fornax.\nOur findings of low [alpha/Fe] and enhanced [Eu/Mg] are compatible with an\ninitial mass function that lacks the most massive stars and with star formation\nthat kept going on throughout the whole history of Fornax. We find that massive\nstars kept enriching the interstellar medium in alpha-elements, although they\nwere not the main contributor to the iron enrichment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 20:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

Residual dipoles are\nseen in the WMAP and Planck sky map differences, but are consistent within the\nuncertainties and are not large enough to explain the widely-noted differences\nin angular power spectra at higher l. After removing residual dipoles and\ngalactic foregrounds, the residual difference maps exhibit a quadrupole and\nother large-scale systematic structure. We identify this structure as possibly\noriginating from Planck's beam sidelobe pick-up, but note that it appears to\nhave insignificant cosmological impact.

We revisit the analysis of WMAP's\nbeam data and conclude that previously-derived uncertainties are robust and\ncannot explain the power spectrum differences.

The measurements involve the detection of\nphotons by two spatially separated parties. The detection times are recorded\nand compared to quantify the violation. The violation critically depends on\ndetermining which detections are coincident. Because the recorded detection\ntimes have \"jitter\", coincidences cannot be inferred perfectly. In the presence\nof settings-dependent timing errors, this can allow a local-realistic system to\nshow apparent violation--the so-called \"coincidence loophole\". Here we\nintroduce a family of Bell inequalities based on signed, directed distances\nbetween the parties' sequences of recorded timetags. Given that the timetags\nare recorded for synchronized, fixed observation periods and that the settings\nchoices are random and independent of the source, violation of these\ninequalities unambiguously shows non-classical correlations violating local\nrealism. Distance-based Bell inequalities are generally useful for two-party\nconfigurations where the effective size of the measurement outcome space is\nlarge or infinite.

In the\nliterature, two retrieving schemes have been proposed for the network dynamics,\nnamely sum-of-sum and sum-of-max. They both offer considerably better\nperformance than Willshaw and Hopfield networks, when comparable retrieval\nscenarios are considered. Former discussions and experiments concentrate on the\nerasure scenario, where a partial message is used as a probe to the network, in\nthe hope of retrieving the full message. In this regard, sum-of-max outperforms\nsum-of-sum in terms of retrieval rate by a large margin. However, we observe\nthat when noise and errors are present and the network is queried by a corrupt\nprobe, sum-of-max faces a severe limitation as its stringent activation rule\nprevents a neuron from reviving back into play once deactivated.

The later an escape mutation emerges, the slower it outgrows its\ncompetition, i. e. the escape rate is lower. This pattern could indicate that\nthe strength of the CD8+ cell responses is waning, or that later viral escape\nmutants carry a larger fitness cost. In this paper, we investigate whether the\npattern of decreasing escape rate could also be caused by genetic interference\namong different escape strains. To this end, we developed a mathematical\nmulti-epitope model of HIV dynamics, which incorporates stochastic effects,\nrecombination and mutation. We used cumulative linkage disequilibrium measures\nto quantify the amount of interference. We found that nearly synchronous,\nsimilarly strong immune responses in two-locus systems enhance the generation\nof genetic interference. This effect, combined with densely spaced sampling\ntimes at the beginning of infection, leads to decreasing successive escape rate\nestimates, even when there were no selection differences among alleles. These\npredictions are supported by experimental data from one HIV-infected patient.\nThus, interference could explain why later escapes are slower. Considering\nescape mutations in isolation, neglecting their genetic linkage, conceals the\nunderlying haplotype dynamics and can affect the estimation of the selective\npressure exerted by CD8+ cells. In systems in which multiple escape mutations\nappear, the occurrence of interference dynamics should be assessed by measuring\nthe linkage between different escape mutations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Sep 2014 06:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-30"}

The discussion here is restricted to the Galactic\nsynchrotron radiation, the most dominant foreground component after point\nsource removal. Our theoretical analysis is validated using simulations at 150\nMHz, mainly for GMRT and also briefly for LOFAR. The Bare Estimator uses\npairwise correlations of the measured visibilities, while the Tapered Gridded\nEstimator uses the visibilities after gridding in the uv plane. The former is\nvery precise, but computationally expensive for large data. The latter has a\nlower precision, but takes less computation time which is proportional to the\ndata volume. The latter also allows tapering of the sky response leading to\nsidelobe suppression, an useful ingredient for foreground removal. Both\nestimators avoid the positive bias that arises due to the system noise. We\nconsider amplitude and phase errors of the gain, and the w-term as possible\nsources of errors . We find that the estimated angular power spectrum is\nexponentially sensitive to the variance of the phase errors but insensitive to\namplitude errors.

It was demonstrated that non-Fermi liquid like behavior of the\nresistivity for K$_{1-x}$Na$_{x}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ and some KFe$_2$As$_2$ samples\ncan be explained by disorder effect in the multiband system with rather\ndifferent quasiparticle effective masses. Concerning the superconducting state\nour data support the presence of a shallow minimum around 2 GPa in the pressure\ndependence of $T_c$ for stoichiometric KFe$_2$As$_2$. The analysis of $T_c$ in\nthe K$_{1-x}$Na$_{x}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ at pressures below 1.5 GPa showed, that the\nreduction of $T_c$ with Na substitution follows the Abrikosov-Gor'kov law with\nthe critical temperature $T_{c0}$ of the clean system (without pair-breaking)\nwhich linearly depends on the pressure.

We generalize\nprevious work on adaptive sensing to (a) include multiple classes of targets\nwith different levels of importance and (b) accommodate multiple sensor models.\nNew optimization policies are developed to allocate a limited resource budget\nto simultaneously locate, classify and estimate a sparse number of targets\nembedded in a large space. Upper and lower bounds on the performance of the\nproposed policies are derived by analyzing a baseline policy, which allocates\nresources uniformly across the scene, and an oracle policy which has a priori\nknowledge of the target locations/classes. These bounds quantify analytically\nthe potential benefit of adaptive sensing as a function of target frequency and\nimportance. Numerical results indicate that the proposed policies perform close\nto the oracle bound (<3dB) when signal quality is sufficiently high\n(e.g.~performance within 3 dB for SNR above 15 dB). Moreover, the proposed\npolicies improve on previous policies in terms of reducing estimation error,\nreducing misclassification probability, and increasing expected return. To\naccount for sensors with different levels of agility, three sensor models are\nconsidered: global adaptive (GA), which can allocate different amounts of\nresource to each location in the space; global uniform (GU), which can allocate\nresources uniformly across the scene; and local adaptive (LA), which can\nallocate fixed units to a subset of locations. Policies that use a mixture of\nGU and LA sensors are shown to perform similarly to those that use GA sensors\nwhile being more easily implementable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Sep 2014 12:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-30"}

We carry out a comprehensive Bayesian\nuncertainty analysis and obtain correlated uncertainties for the normalization\nand shape parameters of the form factor. The $z$-series parametrization for\n$f_{B\\pi}^+$ is employed to extrapolate our results to large momentum transfer,\nand to compare with the lattice QCD results. To test the validity of our\nextrapolation we use the upper and lower bounds from the unitarity and\npositivity of the two-point correlator of heavy-light quark currents. This\ncorrelator is updated by including the NNLO perturbative term and the NLO\ncorrection to the quark condensate contribution. We demonstrate that an\nadditional input including the form factor, its first and second derivative\ncalculated at one value of momentum transfer from the light-cone sum rules,\nconsiderably improves the bounds.
