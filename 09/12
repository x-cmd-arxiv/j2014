While the stronger turbulence enhances the ram\npressure stripping mass loss, the magnetic fields tend to suppress the\nstripping rates, and the suppression is stronger for parallel fields. However,\nthe effect of magnetic fields on the mass stripping rate is mild. Nevertheless,\nthe morphology of the stripping tails depends significantly on the direction of\nthe ICM magnetic field. The effect of the magnetic field geometry on the tail\nmorphology is much stronger than that of the level of the ISM turbulence. The\ntail has a highly collimated shape for parallel fields, while it has a\nsheet-like morphology in the plane of the ICM magnetic field for perpendicular\nfields. The magnetic field in the tail is amplified irrespectively of the\norientation of the ICM field. More strongly magnetised regions in the ram\npressure stripping tails are expected to have systematically higher metallicity\ndue to the strong concentration of the stripped ISM than the less magnetised\nregions.

There are a number of different definitions of\nmatroids, a phenomenon known as cryptomorphism. In this survey, we begin by\nreviewing the classical definitions of matroids, develop operations in matroid\ntheory, summarize some results in representability, and construct polynomial\ninvariants of matroids. Afterwards, we focus on matroid polytopes, introduced\nby Gelfand-Goresky-MacPherson-Serganova, which give a cryptomorphic definition\nof matroids. We explain certain locally closed subsets of the Grassmannian,\nthin Schubert cells, which are labeled by matroids, and which have applications\nto representability, moduli problems, and invariants of matroids following\nFink-Speyer.

The thermodynamic potential conjugate to $\\Lambda$ in the bulk is\ncalled the thermodynamic volume and has a simple geometric formula. In the\nboundary first law it plays the role of a chemical potential. For the bulk\nminimal surface $\\Sigma$ corresponding to a boundary sphere, the thermodynamic\nvolume is found to be proportional to the area of $\\Sigma$, in agreement with\nthe variation of the known result for entanglement entropy of spheres. The\ndependence of the CFT chemical potential on the entanglement entropy and number\nof degrees of freedom is similar to how the thermodynamic chemical potential of\nan ideal gas depends on entropy and particle number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2014 18:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 12:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

First, a new fine structure is observed in the ESR\nspectrum arising from state mixing by the hyperfine coupling to the 31P nuclei,\nwhich is enhanced when the exchange energy is comparable to the Zeeman energy.\nThis fine structure enables us to spectroscopically address two separate dimer\nsub-ensembles, the first with exchange (J) coupling ranging from 2 to 7 GHz and\nthe second with J ranging from 6 to 60 GHz. Next, the average spin relaxation\ntimes, T1 and T2 of both dimer sub-ensembles were measured using pulsed ESR at\n0.35 T. Both T1 and T2 for transitions between triplet states of the dimers\nwere found to be identical to the relaxation times of isolated phosphorus\ndonors in 28Si, with T2 = 4 ms at 1.7 K limited by spectral diffusion due to\ndipolar interactions with neighboring donor electron spins.

Using an analytic\nmodel for the halo mass function of a mixed DM model with axions and cold dark\nmatter, combined with the abundance-matching technique, we construct the\nUV-luminosity function. Axions suppress high-$z$ galaxy formation and the\nUV-luminosity function is truncated at a faintest limiting magnitude. From the\nUV-luminosity function, we predict the reionization history of the universe and\nfind that axion DM causes reionization to occur at lower redshift.

From this we show that very\nhigh min-entropy extractors as well as extractors with small output are always\n(approximately) quantum-proof. We also study a generalization of extractors\ncalled randomness condensers. We phrase the definition of condensers as a\nbounded norm condition and the definition of quantum-proof condensers as a\ncompletely bounded norm condition. Seeing condensers as bipartite graphs, we\nthen find that the bounded norm condition corresponds to an instance of a well\nstudied combinatorial problem, called bipartite densest subgraph. Furthermore,\nusing the characterization in terms of operator spaces, we can associate to any\ncondenser a Bell inequality (two-player game) such that classical and quantum\nstrategies are in one-to-one correspondence with classical and quantum attacks\non the condenser.

Using a sample of ~10,000 kinematically-unbiased red-clump\nstars with ~5% distance accuracy as tracers, the [alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H]\ndistribution of this sample exhibits a bimodality in [alpha/Fe] at intermediate\nmetallicities, -0.9<[Fe/H]<-0.2, but at higher metallicities ([Fe/H]=+0.2) the\ntwo sequences smoothly merge.

The described\nabundance pattern is found throughout the range 5<R<11 kpc and 0<|Z|<2 kpc\nacross the Galaxy. The [alpha/Fe] trend of the high-alpha sequence is\nsurprisingly constant throughout the Galaxy, with little variation from region\nto region (~10%).

The inhibition of the convective blueshift inside active\nregions is considered, as well as the limb brightening effect of plages, a\nquadratic limb darkening law, and a realistic spot and plage contrast ratio.\nSOAP 2.0 shows that the activity-induced variation of plages is dominated by\nthe inhibition of the convective blueshift effect.

The data\npresented in this study are relevant for astrophysical applications, such as\nmagnetized white dwarf and neutron star spectral analysis as well as opacity\ncalculations and absorption features, including in the context of material\naccreting onto the surfaces of these compact objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Sep 2014 21:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In a plot of i against\nOmega the bright Kreutz sungrazers (such as C/1843 D1, C/1882 R1, C/1963 R1,\netc.) fit a curve of fixed apsidal orientation, whereas the dwarf members are\ndistributed along a curve that makes with the apsidal curve an angle of 15 deg.\nThe dwarf sungrazers' perihelion longitude is statistically invariable, but\ntheir perihelion latitude increases systematically with Omega. We find that\nthis trend can be explained by a strong erosion-driven nongravitational\nacceleration normal to the orbit plane, confirmed for several test dwarf Kreutz\nsungrazers by orbital solutions with nongravitational terms incorporated\ndirectly in the equations of motion on a condition of fixed apsidal\norientation.

Based on this observation, we propose a speedup solver (via ALM and\nequivalent derivations) to highly reduce the computational cost, theoretically\nfrom $O(N^{4})$ to $O(N{}^{2}L)$.

No-signaling\nboxes are the abstract objects for studying non-locality, and wirings are local\noperations on the space of no-signaling boxes. This means that, no matter how\nnon-local the nature is, the set of physical non-local correlations must be\nclosed under wirings. Then, one approach to identify the non-locality of nature\nis to characterize closed sets of non-local correlations. Although non-trivial\nexamples of wirings of no-signaling boxes are known, there is no systematic way\nto study wirings. In particular, given a set of no-signaling boxes, we do not\nknow a general method to prove that it is closed under wirings. In this paper,\nwe propose the first general method to construct such closed sets of non-local\ncorrelations. We show that a well-known measure of correlation, called maximal\ncorrelation, when appropriately defined for non-local correlations, is\nmonotonically decreasing under wirings.\n  This establishes a conjecture about the impossibility of simulating isotropic\nboxes from each other, implying the existence of a continuum of closed sets of\nnon-local boxes under wirings. To prove our main result, we introduce some\nmathematical tools that may be of independent interest: we define a notion of\nmaximal correlation ribbon as a generalization of maximal correlation, and\nprovide a connection between it and a known object called hypercontractivity\nribbon; we show that these two ribbons are monotone under wirings too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 07:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Oct 2014 10:32:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 13:37:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 11:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-12"}

Examining the higher level difference\ncoefficients acts as a troubled-cell indicator, thus avoiding unnecessary\nincreased computational cost of a new expansion. In two-dimensions the\nmultiwavelet decomposition uses combinations of scaling functions and\nmultiwavelets in the x- and y-directions for improved troubled-cell indication.\nBy using such a troubled-cell indicator, we are able to reduce the\ncomputational cost by avoiding limiting in smooth regions.

Then, using generating function techniques, we compute the\njoint probability distribution of $s$ and $r$, where $r$ is the number of sites\nvisited only once up to time $t$. Mean values, variances and covariance are\ndeduced from the generating functions and their finite-size-scaling behaviour\nis studied. Introducing properly centered and scaled variables $u$ and $v$ for\n$r$ and $s$ and working in the scaling limit ($t\\to\\infty$, $N\\to\\infty$ with\n$w=t/N$ fixed) the joint probability density of $u$ and $v$ is shown to be a\nbivariate Gaussian density. It follows that the fluctuations of $r$ and $s$\naround their mean values in a finite-size system are Gaussian in the scaling\nlimit. The same type of finite-size scaling is expected to hold on periodic\nlattices above the critical dimension $d_{\\rm c}=2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Sep 2014 12:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-21"}

We consider three emission\nmodels, i.e. a one-component synchrotron self-Compton model (1-SSC), a one-zone\nproton synchrotron model (LHs), and a two-component SSC model (2-SSC). Only in\nthe first scenario can the emission from the optical up to TeV gamma-rays be\nattributed to a single particle population from one emission region. Using a\ntime-dependent numerical code that solves the kinetic equations for each\nparticle species, we derived, in all cases, acceptable fits to the\ntime-averaged SED. By imposing variations to one (or more) model parameters\naccording to observed variability pattern in one (or more) frequencies we\ncalculated the respective light curves and compared them with the observations.\nWe show that the 1-SSC model cannot account for the anticorrelation observed\nbetween the X-rays and VHE gamma-rays, although it can explain the\ntime-averaged SED. The anticorrelation can be more naturally explained by the\ntwo-component emission models. Both of them reproduce satisfactorily the\noptical, X-ray, and TeV variability but at the cost of additional free\nparameters, which from four in the 2-SSC model increase to six in the LHs\nmodel. Although the results of our time-resolved analysis do not favour one of\nthe aforementioned models, they suggest that a two-component scenario is more\nadequate for the emission of PKS 2155-304 in the low state of 2008, which\nagrees with a recent independent analysis.

To this end, various useful approaches have been\nproposed in the context of $\\ell_1$-penalized estimation in the Gaussian\nframework. Though many of these inverse covariance estimation approaches are\ndemonstrably scalable and have leveraged recent advances in convex\noptimization, they still depend on the Gaussian functional form. To address\nthis gap, a convex pseudo-likelihood based partial correlation graph estimation\nmethod (CONCORD) has been recently proposed. This method uses coordinate-wise\nminimization of a regression based pseudo-likelihood, and has been shown to\nhave robust model selection properties in comparison with the Gaussian\napproach. In direct contrast to the parallel work in the Gaussian setting\nhowever, this new convex pseudo-likelihood framework has not leveraged the\nextensive array of methods that have been proposed in the machine learning\nliterature for convex optimization.
