A large number of applications\ndemand for more comprehensive knowledge on primary user behaviors in spatial,\ntemporal, and frequency domains. To satisfy such requirements, we study the\nstatistical relationship among primary users by introducing a Bayesian network\n(BN) based framework. How to learn such a BN structure is a long standing\nissue, not fully understood even in the statistical learning community.\nBesides, another key problem in this learning scenario is that the CR has to\nidentify how many variables are in the BN, which is usually considered as prior\nknowledge in statistical learning applications. To solve such two issues\nsimultaneously, this paper proposes a BN structure learning scheme consisting\nof an efficient structure learning algorithm and a blind variable\nidentification scheme. The proposed approach incurs significantly lower\ncomputational complexity compared with previous ones, and is capable of\ndetermining the structure without assuming much prior knowledge about\nvariables.

In this\npaper, we introduce a new community detection algorithm, called Attractor,\nwhich automatically spots the communities or groups in a network over time via\nlocal dynamic interaction. The basic idea is to envision a network as a\ndynamical system, and each agent interacts with its local partners. Instead of\ninvestigating the node dynamics, we actually examine the change of \"distances\"\namong linked nodes. As time evolves, these distances will be shrunk or\nstretched gradually based on their topological structures. Finally all\ndistances among linked nodes will converge into a stable pattern, and\ncommunities can be intuitively identified. Thanks to the dynamic viewpoint of\ncommunity detection, Attractor has several potential attractive properties: (a)\nAttractor provides an intuitive solution to analyze the community structure of\na network, and faithfully captures the natural communities (with high quality).\n(b) Owing to its time complexity $O(|E|)$, Attractor allows finding communities\non large networks. (c) The small communities or anomalies, usually existing in\nreal-world networks, can be well pinpointed. (d) Attractor is easy to\nparameterize, since there is no need to specify the number of clusters.\nExtensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks further demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 01:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-30"}

In\n1972, Ronald Coase conjectured that a duropolist who lacks commitment power\ncannot sell the good above the competitive price if the time between periods\napproaches zero. Coase's counterintuitive conjecture was later proven by Gul et\nal. (1986) under an infinite time horizon model with non-atomic consumers.\nRemarkably, the situation changes dramatically for atomic consumers and an\ninfinite time horizon. Bagnoli et al.

In particular, duropoly profits are always at least static\nmonopoly profits but never exceed twice the static monopoly profits.\n  Finally we show that, for atomic consumers, equilibria may exist that do not\nsatisfy the skimming property.

The difference between FWHM12CO and FWHM13CO of the\ninterarm indicates the existence of two components, one with a narrow line\nwidth (~FWHM13CO) and the other with a broad line width (~FWHM12CO).\nAdditionally, the T12CO/T13CO ratio in the broad-line-width component of the\ninterarm is higher than the other regions. The high T12CO/T13CO in the center\nand bar and of the broad-line-width component in the interarm suggest the\nexistence of non-optically thick 12CO components.

This new scheme, named BL-DMRG method, allows us to\ncalculate not only local but also spatially dependent static and dynamical\nquantities of the ground state for general Anderson impurity models without\nlosing elaborate geometrical information of the lattice. We show that the\nBL-DMRG method can be easily extended to treat a multi-orbital Anderson\nimpurity model. We also show that the symmetry adapted BL bases can be\nutilized, when it is appropriate, to reduce the computational cost. As a\ndemonstration, we apply the BL-DMRG method to three different models for\ngraphene: (i) a single adatom on the honeycomb lattice, (ii) a substitutional\nimpurity in the honeycomb lattice, and (iii) an effective model for a single\ncarbon vacancy in graphene. Our analysis reveals that, for the particle-hole\nsymmetric case at half filling of electron density, the ground state of model\n(i) behaves as an isolated magnetic impurity with no Kondo screening while the\nground state of the other two models forms a spin singlet state. We also\ncalculate the real-space dependence of the spin-spin correlation functions\nbetween the impurity site and the conduction sites for these three models.

The study\nof the convergence properties of these methods is in general difficult due to\nthe nonconvexity of the problem. In this paper, two distributed solution\nmethods that combine the fast convergence properties of augmented\nLagrangian-based methods with the separability properties of alternating\noptimization are investigated. The first method is adapted from the classic\nquadratic penalty function method and is called the Alternating Direction\nPenalty Method (ADPM). Unlike the original quadratic penalty function method,\nin which single-step optimizations are adopted, ADPM uses an alternating\noptimization, which in turn makes it scalable. The second method is the\nwell-known Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). It is shown that\nADPM for nonconvex problems asymptotically converges to a primal feasible point\nunder mild conditions and an additional condition ensuring that it\nasymptotically reaches the standard first order necessary conditions for local\noptimality are introduced. In the case of the ADMM, novel sufficient conditions\nunder which the algorithm asymptotically reaches the standard first order\nnecessary conditions are established. Based on this, complete convergence of\nADMM for a class of low dimensional problems are characterized. Finally, the\nresults are illustrated by applying ADPM and ADMM to a nonconvex localization\nproblem in wireless sensor networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 09:13:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 21:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-04"}

For instance, for any $\\alpha <\n1/2$, our algorithm finds the (unique) closest lattice point for any target\npoint whose distance from the lattice is at most $\\alpha$ times the length of\nthe shortest nonzero lattice vector, requires as preprocessing advice only $N\n\\approx \\widetilde{O}(n \\exp(\\alpha^2 n /(1-2\\alpha)^2))$ vectors, and runs in\ntime $\\widetilde{O}(nN)$.\n  As our second main contribution, we present reductions showing that it\nsuffices to solve CVP, both in its plain and preprocessing versions, when the\ninput target point is within some bounded distance of the lattice.

Due to the\noptomechanical coupling an external force on the mechanical oscillator\nmodulates the resonance frequency of the cavity and consequently the switching\nrates between the two bistable branches. A large difference in the cavity\noutput fields then leads to a strongly amplified homodyne signal. We determine\nthe switching rates as a function of the cavity detuning from extensive\nnumerical simulations of the stochastic master equation as appropriate for\ncontinuous homodyne detection. We develop a two-state rate equation model that\nquantitatively describes the slow switching dynamics. This model is solved\nanalytically in the presence of a weak harmonic force to obtain approximate\nexpressions for the power gain and signal-to-noise ratio that we then compare\nto force detection with an optomechanical system in the linear regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 11:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-11"}

At tree level, the\nBCFW recursion relations are analyzed with respect to their validity for\ngeneral off-shell objects in Yang-Mills theory, which is a significant step\naway from their established zone of applicability. Unphysical poles constitute\na new potential problem in addition to the boundary behavior issue, common to\nthe on-shell case as well. For an infinite family of massive fermion currents,\nboth obstacles are shown to be avoided under the certain conditions, which\nprovides a natural recursion relation. At one loop, scattering amplitudes can\nbe calculated from unitarity cuts through their expansion into known scalar\nintegrals with free coefficients. A powerful method to obtain these\ncoefficients, namely spinor integration, is discussed and rederived in a\nsomewhat novel form.

An\naccurate analysis of robustness is thus essential in understanding and\nachieving model-based quantum control, such as in control of chemical reactions\nbased on ab initio or experimental estimates of the molecular Hamiltonian. In\nthis paper, theoretical foundations for quantum control robustness analysis are\npresented from both a distributional perspective - in terms of moments of the\ntransition amplitude, interferences, and transition probability - and a\nworst-case perspective. Based on this theory, analytical expressions and a\ncomputationally efficient method for determining the robustness of coherently\ncontrolled quantum dynamics are derived. The robustness analysis reveals that\nthere generally exists a set of control pathways that are more resistant to\ndestructive interferences in the presence of control field and system parameter\nuncertainty.

By extending the general BC-multiple\naccess channel (MAC) duality, which is only applicable to WSRMax problems with\nMaxLTCCs, and applying the ellipsoid method, we propose an efficient algorithm\nto solve this problem globally optimally.

Observed CO line profiles are due to a complex distribution in density,\ntemperature, velocity, and geometry. Resolving the HH54 shock wave in the\nfar-infrared cooling lines of CO constrain the kinematics, morphology, and\nphysical conditions of the shocked region. We used the PACS and SPIRE\ninstruments on board the Herschel space observatory to map the full FIR\nspectrum in a region covering the HH54 shock wave. Complementary Herschel-HIFI,\nAPEX, and Spitzer data are used in the analysis as well. The observed features\nin the line profiles are reproduced using a 3D radiative transfer model of a\nbow-shock, constructed with the Line Modeling Engine code (LIME). The FIR\nemission is confined to the HH54 region and a coherent displacement of the\nlocation of the emission maximum of CO with increasing J is observed. The peak\npositions of the high-J CO lines are shifted upstream from the lower J CO lines\nand coincide with the position of the spectral feature identified previously in\nCO(10-9) profiles with HIFI. This indicates a hotter molecular component in the\nupstream gas with distinct dynamics. The coherent displacement with increasing\nJ for CO is consistent with a scenario where IRAS12500-7658 is the exciting\nsource of the flow, and the 180 K bow-shock is accompanied by a hot (800 K)\nmolecular component located upstream from the apex of the shock and blueshifted\nby -7 km s$^{-1}$.

Our contribution is twofold; first, we\npropose a new Bayesian model for structured sparse regression in which the\nsupports of the sparse abundance vectors are a priori spatially correlated\nacross pixels (i.e., materials are spatially organised rather than randomly\ndistributed at a pixel level). This prior information is encoded in the model\nthrough a truncated multivariate Ising Markov random field, which also takes\ninto consideration the facts that pixels cannot be empty (i.e, there is at\nleast one material present in each pixel), and that different materials may\nexhibit different degrees of spatial regularity. Secondly, we propose an\nadvanced Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the posterior\nprobabilities that materials are present or absent in each pixel, and,\nconditionally to the maximum marginal a posteriori configuration of the\nsupport, compute the MMSE estimates of the abundance vectors. A remarkable\nproperty of this algorithm is that it self-adjusts the values of the parameters\nof the Markov random field, thus relieving practitioners from setting\nregularisation parameters by cross-validation. The performance of the proposed\nmethodology is finally demonstrated through a series of experiments with\nsynthetic and real data and comparisons with other algorithms from the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 14:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2015 10:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-06"}

The masses of both\nplanets and the orbital parameters for the second planet were determined using\nprecise radial velocity (RV) measurements from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET)\nand its High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS). In stark contrast to smaller\nplanets, hot Jupiters are predominantly found to be lacking any nearby\nadditional planets, the appear to be \"lonely\" (e.g. Steffen et al.~2012). This\nmight be a consequence of a highly dynamical past of these systems. The\nKepler-424 planetary system is a system with a hot Jupiter in a multiple\nsystem, similar to upsilon Andromedae. We also present our results for\nKepler-422 (KOI-22), Kepler-77 (KOI-127; Gandolfi et al.~2013), Kepler-43\n(KOI-135; Bonomo et al.~2012), and Kepler-423 (KOI-183). These results are\nbased on spectroscopic data collected with the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT),\nthe Keck 1 telescope and HET. For all systems we rule out false positives based\non various follow-up observations, confirming the planetary nature of these\ncompanions. We performed a comparison with planetary evolutionary models which\nindicate that these five hot Jupiters have a heavy elements content between 20\nand 120 M_Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 15:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The simulations are analyzed with a\nLarge Velocity Gradient (LVG) model to compute the local emission in various\nmolecular lines in each resolution element, radiation transfer and opacity\neffects, and the intensity emerging from galaxies, to generate synthetic\nspectra for various transitions of the CO molecule. This model reproduces the\nknown properties of CO spectra and CO-to-H2 conversion factors in nearby\nspirals and starbursting major mergers. The high excitation of CO lines in\nmergers is dominated by an excess of high-density gas, and the high turbulent\nvelocities and compression that create this dense gas excess result in broad\nlinewidths and low CO intensity-to-H2 mass ratios. When applied to\nhigh-redshift gas-rich disks galaxies, the same model predicts that their\nCO-to-H2 conversion factor is almost as high as in nearby spirals, and much\nhigher than in starbursting mergers.

In this framework, we introduce a convex optimization\nalgorithm based on the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates.

However, a complete physical picture able to\npredict the structure developing within the porous medium is lacking. We\ninvestigate theoretically reactive transport in the long-time evolution of\ncarbon in the brine-rock environment. As CO$_2$ is injected into a brine-rock\nenvironment, a carbonate-rich region is created amid brine. Within the\ncarbonate-rich region minerals dissolve and migrate from regions of high\nconcentration to low concentration, along with other dissolved carbonate\nspecies. This causes mineral precipitation at the interface between the two\nregions. We argue that precipitation in a small layer reduces diffusivity, and\neventually causes mechanical trapping of the CO$_2$. Consequently, only a small\nfraction of the CO$_2$ is converted to solid mineral; the remainder either\ndissolves in water or is trapped in its original form. We also study the case\nof a pure CO$_2$ bubble surrounded by brine and suggest a mechanism that may\nlead to a carbonate-encrusted bubble due to structural diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 13:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-20"}
