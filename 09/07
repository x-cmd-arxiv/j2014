Occurring on special days, such as public holidays, anomalous load\nconditions pose considerable modeling challenges due to their infrequent\noccurrence and significant deviation from normal load. To overcome these\nlimitations, we adopt a rule-based approach, which allows incorporation of\nprior expert knowledge of load profiles into the statistical model. We use\ntriple seasonal Holt-Winters-Taylor (HWT) exponential smoothing, triple\nseasonal autoregressive moving average (ARMA), artificial neural networks\n(ANNs), and triple seasonal intraweek singular value decomposition (SVD) based\nexponential smoothing. These methods have been shown to be competitive for\nmodeling load for normal days. The methodological contribution of this paper is\nto demonstrate how these methods can be adapted to model load for special days,\nwhen used in conjunction with a rule-based approach. The proposed rule-based\nmethod is able to model normal and anomalous load in a unified framework. Using\nnine years of half-hourly load for Great Britain, we evaluate point forecasts,\nfor lead times from one half-hour up to a day ahead. A combination of two\nrule-based methods generated the most accurate forecasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2014 16:04:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Frontal EEG asymmetry in the alpha band is\na widely used measure of emotion and motivation that shows profound changes in\ndepression. However, it has never been directly related to simultaneously\nacquired fMRI data. We report the first study investigating\nelectrophysiological correlates of the rtfMRI-nf procedure, by combining\nrtfMRI-nf with simultaneous and passive EEG recordings. In this pilot study,\nMDD patients in the experimental group (n=13) learned to upregulate BOLD\nactivity of the left amygdala using an rtfMRI-nf during a happy emotion\ninduction task. MDD patients in the control group (n=11) were provided with a\nsham rtfMRI-nf. Correlations between frontal EEG asymmetry in the upper alpha\nband and BOLD activity across the brain were examined. Average individual\nchanges in frontal EEG asymmetry during the rtfMRI-nf task for the experimental\ngroup showed a significant positive correlation with the MDD patients'\ndepression severity ratings, consistent with an inverse correlation between the\ndepression severity and frontal EEG asymmetry at rest. Temporal correlations\nbetween frontal EEG asymmetry and BOLD activity were significantly enhanced,\nduring the rtfMRI-nf task, for the amygdala and many regions associated with\nemotion regulation. Our findings demonstrate an important link between amygdala\nBOLD activity and frontal EEG asymmetry. Our EEG asymmetry results suggest that\nthe rtfMRI-nf training targeting the amygdala is beneficial to MDD patients,\nand that alpha-asymmetry EEG-nf would be compatible with the amygdala\nrtfMRI-nf. Combination of the two could enhance emotion regulation training and\nbenefit MDD patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2014 19:01:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 23:32:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 22:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

The field of cluster analysis is crowded with diverse methods that\nmake special assumptions about data and address different scientific aims.\nDespite its shortcomings in accuracy, hierarchical clustering is the dominant\nclustering method in bioinformatics. Biologists find the trees constructed by\nhierarchical clustering visually appealing and in tune with their evolutionary\nperspective. Hierarchical clustering operates on multiple scales\nsimultaneously. This is essential, for instance, in transcriptome data where\none may be interested in making qualitative inferences about how lower-order\nrelationships like gene modules lead to higher-order relationships like\npathways or biological processes. The recently developed method of convex\nclustering preserves the visual appeal of hierarchical clustering while\nameliorating its propensity to make false inferences in the presence of\noutliers and noise. The current paper exploits the proximal distance principle\nto construct a novel algorithm for solving the convex clustering problem. The\nsolution paths generated by convex clustering reveal relationships between\nclusters that are hidden by static methods such as k-means clustering. Our\nconvex clustering software separates parameters, accommodates missing data, and\nsupports prior information on relationships. The software is implemented on ATI\nand nVidia graphics processing units (GPUs) for maximal speed. Several\nbiological examples illustrate the strengths of convex clustering and the\nability of the proximal distance algorithm to handle high-dimensional problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2014 22:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-07"}

Using empirical process theory, we\nprove a uniform central limit theorem for a large class of random forest\nestimates, which holds in particular for Breiman's original forests. Secondly,\nwe show that infinite forest consistency implies finite forest consistency and\nthus, we state the consistency of several infinite forests.

We\nalso analyze what stacking suggests about the relation between SFR and stellar\nmass and the redshift evolution of the specific SFR (${\\rm sSFR} = {\\rm SFR} /\n{\\rm M_*}$). We find that the dust properties of massive SF galaxies evolve\nwith redshift, being galaxies at $z \\sim 2-3$ more attenuated than at $z \\sim\n1$ for a given UV continuum slope and stellar mass. As a consequence, a single\nIRX-$\\beta$ relation can not be used to recover the total SFR of massive SF\ngalaxies at $0 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 3$. This might have implications for higher\nredshift studies, where a single IRX-$\\beta$ relation derived for local\nstarburst is usually assumed to be valid.

To illustrate the power of this\nmethod, we have computed energy shifts, lattice site dipole moments, and\nharmonic vibrational frequencies via explicit calculation of the bulk system\nfor the polar and non-polar polymorphs of solid hydrogen fluoride. The explicit\nlattice size (without using any periodic boundary conditions) was expanded up\nto 1,000 HF molecules, with 32,000 basis functions and 10,000 electrons. Our\nobtained HF lattice site dipole moments and harmonic vibrational frequencies\nagree well with the existing literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Sep 2014 21:20:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 18:36:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 17:38:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Jan 2015 22:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 13:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

RbMnPO4 represents\na rare example of a weak ferromagnetic polar material, containing Mn2+ ions\nwith TN = 4.7 K. The neutron powder diffraction pattern recorded at T = 10 K\nshows that the compound crystallizes in the chiral and polar monoclinic space\ngroup P21 (No. 4) with the unit-cell parameters: a = 8.94635(9) {\\AA}, b =\n5.43415(5) {\\AA}, c = 9.10250(8) {\\AA} and beta = 90.4209(6){\\deg}. A close\ninspection of the crystal structure of RbMnPO4 shows that this material\npresents two different types of zigzag chains running along the b axis. This is\na unique feature among the zeolite-ABW type materials exhibiting the P21\nsymmetry. At low temperature, RbMnPO4 exhibits a canted antiferromagnetic\nstructure characterized by the propagation vector k1 = 0 resulting in the\nmagnetic symmetry P21. The magnetic moments lie mostly along the b axis with\nthe ferromagnetic component being in the ac plane. Due to the geometrical\nfrustration present in this system, an intermediate phase appears within the\ntemperature range 4.7 - 5.1 K characterized by the propagation vector k2 = (kx,\n0, kz) with kx/kz = 2. This ratio is reminiscent of the multiferroic phase of\nthe orthorhombic RMnO3 phases (R = rare earth). This suggests that RbMnPO4\ncould present some multiferroic properties at low temperature. Our density\nfunctional calculations confirm the presence of magnetic frustration, which\nexplains this intermediate incommensurate phase. Taking into account the\nstrongest magnetic interactions, we are able to reproduce the magnetic\nstructure observed experimentally at low temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Sep 2014 10:41:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-02"}
