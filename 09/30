Starting from a description in terms of a\nMarkovian quantum master equation we derive effective equations of motion that\ngovern the dynamics on a \"coarse-grained\" timescale where fast dissipative\ndegrees of freedom have been adiabatically eliminated. Specifically, we\nconsider two scenarios which are of relevance for current theoretical and\nexperimental studies --- Rydberg atoms in a two-level (spin) approximation\nsubject to strong dephasing noise as well as Rydberg atoms under so-called\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions and fast radiative\ndecay. In the former case we find that the effective dynamics is described by\nclassical rate equations up to second order in an appropriate perturbative\nexpansion. This drastically reduces the computational complexity of numerical\nsimulations in comparison to the full quantum master equation. When accounting\nfor the fourth order correction in this expansion, however, we find that the\nresulting equation breaks the preservation of positivity and thus cannot be\ninterpreted as a proper classical master rate equation. In the EIT system we\nfind that the expansion up to second order retains information not only on the\n\"classical\" observables, but also on some quantum coherences. Nevertheless,\nthis perturbative treatment still achieves a non-trivial reduction of\ncomplexity with respect to the original problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 16:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-27"}

As expected, solar\npower production is strongly influenced by cloudiness and clear sky, in fact we\nobserve that while during summer we obtain a general error under the 10%\n(slightly lower in south Italy), during winter the error is abundantly above\nthe 20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 17:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-30"}

A consequence of the CSL mechanism is an extremely tiny\nviolation of energy-momentum conservation, which can, in principle, be detected\nin the laboratory via the random diffusion of a particle induced by the\nstochastic collapse mechanism. In a paper in 2003, Collett and Pearle\ninvestigated the translational CSL diffusion of a sphere, and the rotational\nCSL diffusion of a disc, and showed that this effect dominates over the ambient\nenvironmental noise at low temperatures and extremely low pressures (about\nten-thousandth of a pico-Torr). In the present paper, we revisit their analysis\nand argue that this stringent condition on pressure can be relaxed, and that\nthe CSL effect can be seen at the pressure of about a pico-Torr. A similar\nanalysis is provided for diffusion produced by gravity-induced decoherence,\nwhere the effect is typically much weaker than CSL.

In order to provision high network capacity, small cell\nbase stations (SCBSs) are widely deployed. Owing to the close proximity to\nmobile users, SCBSs can effectively enhance the network capacity and offloading\ntraffic load from macro BSs (MBSs). However, the cost-effective backhaul may\nnot be readily available for SCBSs, thus leading to backhaul constraints in\nsmall cell networks (SCNs). Enabling cache in BSs may mitigate the backhaul\nconstraints in SCNs. Moreover, the dense deployment of SCBSs may incur\nexcessive energy consumption. To alleviate brown power consumption, renewable\nenergy will be explored to power BSs. In such a network, it is challenging to\ndynamically balance traffic load among BSs to optimize the network utilities.\nIn this paper, we investigate the traffic load balancing in\nbackhaul-constrained cache-enabled small cell networks powered by hybrid energy\nsources. We have proposed a network utility aware (NUA) traffic load balancing\nscheme that optimizes user association to strike a tradeoff between the green\npower utilization and the traffic delivery latency. On balancing the traffic\nload, the proposed NUA traffic load balancing scheme considers the green power\nutilization, the traffic delivery latency in both BSs and their backhaul, and\nthe cache hit ratio. The NUA traffic load balancing scheme allows dynamically\nadjusting the tradeoff between the green power utilization and the traffic\ndelivery latency. We have proved the convergence and the optimality of the\nproposed NUA traffic load balancing scheme. Through extensive simulations, we\nhave compared performance of the NUA traffic load balancing scheme with other\nschemes and showed its advantages in backhaul-constrained cache-enabled small\ncell networks with hybrid power supplies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 19:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-30"}

This last contribution is going to be characterised by the\nLISA Pathfinder mission, a technology precursor of future space-borne detectors\nlike eLISA. Changing the perspective from displacement to acceleration can\nbenefit the data analysis of LISA Pathfinder and future detectors. The response\nin differential acceleration to gravitational waves is derived for a\nspace-based detector's interferometric link. The acceleration formalism can\nalso be integrated into time delay interferometry by building up the\nunequal-arm Michelson differential acceleration combination. The differential\nacceleration is nominally insensitive to the system free evolution dominating\nthe slow displacement dynamics of low-frequency detectors. Working with\nacceleration also provides an effective way to subtract measured signals acting\nas systematics, including the actuation forces.

To answer this question, we study two networks, the\nneuronal network of C. elegans and the fibre tract network of human brains\nyielded through diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI). We compare them to their\nrespective benchmark networks with varying modularities, which are generated by\nlink swapping to have desired modularity values but otherwise maximally random.\nWe find several network properties that are specific to the neural networks and\ncannot be fully explained by the modularity alone. First, the clustering\ncoefficient and the characteristic path length of C. elegans and human\nconnectomes are both higher than those of the benchmark networks with similar\nmodularity. High clustering coefficient indicates efficient local information\ndistribution and high characteristic path length suggests reduced global\nintegration. Second, the total wiring length is smaller than for the\nalternative configurations with similar modularity. This is due to lower\ndispersion of connections, which means each neuron in C. elegans connectome or\neach region of interest (ROI) in human connectome reaches fewer ganglia or\ncortical areas, respectively.

We investigate the relation between reionization\nhistory and present-day positions of the satellite population. We find that the\naverage reionization redshift (zr) of satellites is higher near galaxy centers\n(MW and M31). This is due to the inside-out reionization patterns imprinted by\nmassive haloes within the progenitor during the EoR, which end up forming the\ncenter of the galaxy. Thanks to incomplete dynamical mixing during galaxy\nassembly, these early patterns survive down to present day, resulting in a a\nclear radial gradient in the average satellites reionization redshift, up to\nthe virial radius of MW and M31 and beyond. In the lowest emissivity scenario,\nthe outer satellites are reionized about 180 Myr later than the inner\nsatellites. This delay decreases with increasing source model emissivity, or in\nthe case of external reionization by Virgo or M31, because reionization happens\nfaster overall, and becomes spatially quasi-uniform at the highest emissivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 20:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

However, with the attractive depletion\nforce, spring removal leads to a first order collapse of the bundles over a\nwide range of tau occupancies for physiologically realizable conditions.

Understanding why stellar evolution yields different types of stellar\nexplosions in these environments is fundamental in order to both uncover the\nelusive progenitors of SLSNe and to study star formation in dwarf galaxies. In\nthis paper, we present the first results of our project to study SUperluminous\nSupernova Host galaxIES, focusing on the sample for which we have obtained\nspectroscopy. We show that SLSNe-I and SLSNe-R (hydrogen-poor) often (~50% in\nour sample) occur in a class of galaxies that is known as Extreme Emission Line\nGalaxies (EELGs). The probability of this happening by chance is negligible and\nwe therefore conclude that the extreme environmental conditions and the SLSN\nphenomenon are related. In contrast, SLSNe-II (hydrogen-rich) occur in more\nmassive, more metal-rich galaxies with softer radiation fields. Therefore, if\nSLSNe-II constitute a uniform class, their progenitor systems are likely\ndifferent from those of H-poor SLSNe.

However, these usually use simplified models for\nnon-elastic (NE) proton-nucleus interactions. Our primary goal is to build a\nGPU-based proton transport MC with detailed modeling of elastic and NE\ncollisions. Methods: Using CUDA, we implemented GPU kernels for these tasks:\n(1) Simulation of spots from our scanning nozzle configurations, (2) Proton\npropagation through CT geometry, considering nuclear elastic scattering,\nmultiple scattering, and energy loss straggling, (3) Modeling of the\nintranuclear cascade stage of NE interactions, (4) Nuclear evaporation\nsimulation, and (5) Statistical error estimates on the dose. To validate our\nMC, we performed: (1) Secondary particle yield calculations in NE collisions,\n(2) Dose calculations in homogeneous phantoms, (3) Re-calculations of head and\nneck plans from a commercial treatment planning system (TPS), and compared with\nGeant4.9.6p2/TOPAS. Results: Yields, energy and angular distributions of\nsecondaries from NE collisions on various nuclei agree well with the Geant4\nBertini and Binary cascade models. The 3D-gamma pass rate at 2\\%-2 mm for\ntreatment plan simulations is typically 98\\%. The net calculation time on a\nNVIDIA GTX680 card, including all data transfers, is $\\sim$20 s for\n$1\\times10^7$ proton histories. Conclusions: Our GPU-based MC is the first of\nits kind to include a detailed nuclear model to handle NE interactions of\nprotons with any nucleus. Dosimetric calculations are in very good agreement\nwith Geant4/TOPAS. Our MC is being used to perform fast routine clinical QA of\npencil-beam based treatment plans, and has also been adopted as the dose engine\nin a clinically-applicable MC-based IMPT TPS. The detailed nuclear modeling\nwill allow us to perform very fast linear energy transfer and neutron dose\nestimates on the GPU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 21:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

In this paper we study the\npossibility of observations of showers, induced by high energy particles in the\natmosphere, in the presence of clouds which are completely or partially opaque\nfor Cherenkov radiation. We show how the image parameters of the Cherenkov\nlight distribution on the telescope camera are influenced for different opacity\nand altitude of the cloud.

The estimated gamma-ray\nselection efficiency for the detector with the camera FOV limited to 8 deg. is\nslightly better than for the camera with unlimited FOV, although the number of\nidentified gamma-ray events is lower.

This article presents an overview of the\nsurvey, its selection function and HST imaging observations. The sample was\nselected from the GALEX+SDSS catalogue at z=0.028-0.19, in order to allow Lya\nto be captured with combinations of long pass filters in the Solar Blind\nChannel (SBC) of HST/ACS. In addition, LARS utilises Halpha and Hbeta narrow,\nand U, B, i broad-band imaging with ACS and WFC3. In order to study galaxies in\nwhich large numbers of Lya photons are produced we demanded an Halpha\nequivalent width > 100{\\AA}. The sample of 14 galaxies covers far UV (FUV)\nluminosities that overlaps with those of high-z Lya emitters and Lyman Break\nGalaxies (LBGs). We present the reduction steps used to obtain the Lya images,\nincluding our LARS eXtraction software (LaXs) which utilises pixel-by-pixel\nspectral synthesis fitting to subtract the continuum at Lya.

ABC avoids evaluation of the likelihood\nfunction by matching observed summary statistics with statistics computed from\ndata simulated from the true process; exact inference being feasible only if\nthe statistics are sufficient. With finite sample sufficiency unattainable in\nthe state space setting, we seek asymptotic sufficiency via the maximum\nlikelihood estimator (MLE) of the parameters of an auxiliary model. We prove\nthat this auxiliary model-based approach achieves Bayesian consistency, and\nthat - in a precise limiting sense - the proximity to (asymptotic) sufficiency\nyielded by the MLE is replicated by the score. In multiple parameter settings a\nseparate treatment of scalar parameters, based on integrated likelihood\ntechniques, is advocated as a way of avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Some\nattention is given to a structure in which the state variable is driven by a\ncontinuous time process, with exact inference typically infeasible in this case\nas a result of intractable transitions. The ABC method is demonstrated using\nthe unscented Kalman filter as a fast and simple way of producing an\napproximation in this setting, with a stochastic volatility model for financial\nreturns used for illustration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 02:11:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

This new\npseudoscalar can have a very low mass without violating the LEP exclusion\nconstraints and it can potentially provide a hallmark signature of non-minimal\nsupersymmetry at the LHC. In this analysis we revisit the light pseudoscalar in\nthe NMSSM with partial universality at some high unification scale. We\ndelineate the regions of the model's parameter space that are consistent with\nthe up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints, from both Higgs boson\nsearches and elsewhere (most notably $b$-physics), and examine to what extent\nthey can be probed by the LHC.

However, the decays of one of the heavier\nscalar Higgsbosons of the NMSSM can potentially lead to the discovery of its\nlight pseudoscalar. Especially promising are the decays of one or both of the\ntwo lightest scalar states into a pseudoscalar pair and of the heaviest scalar\ninto a pseudoscalar and a $Z$ boson.

The concept of quantumness of correlations between the\nobservables of a system is based on incommensurability of the correlations with\nthe predictions of some local hidden variable (LHV) theory. However, the\nconcept of quantumness of mutual information does not invoke the LHV theory\nexplicitly. In this paper, by invoking explicitly the local hidden variable\ntheory, a measure of quantumness of mutual information, $Q_{LHV}$, for a system\nof two spin-1/2 particles is proposed. It is based on finding the difference\nbetween the quantum and classical mutual informations in which the classical\nmutual information corresponds to the joint probability of the eigenvalues of\nthe spins each along a specified direction. The proposed measure circumvents\nthe need of optimization when the Bloch vector of each spin is non-zero; the\noptimization is needed but can be performed analytically exactly when the Bloch\nvector of each spin vanishes and is simplified when the Bloch vector of only\none of the spins is zero. In essence, the proposed measure is identical with\nthe measurement induced disturbance when the Bloch vector of each of the spins\nis non-zero. However, whereas the measurement induced disturbance is non-unique\nwhen the Bloch vector of one or both the spins is zero, the proposed measure\neven then determines the quantumness of mutual information unambiguously. The\n$Q_{LHV}$ is identical with the symmetric discord if the Bloch vector of each\nspin vanishes. It is same as the quantum discord if the Bloch vector of only\none spin is zero and if the state in question possesses certain additional\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 06:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We propose a\nstrategy towards stabilizing the compact space without fluxes of three-form\nfields from closed strings. Our main motivation and goal is to proceed insofar\nas possible within conventional string world-sheet theory. As we shall see,\nD-branes with magnetic flux (\"magnetized D-branes\") and the forces between them\ncan be used to this end. We investigate here some necessary ingredients: open\nstring one-loop vacuum amplitudes between magnetized D-branes, magnetized\nD-branes fixed at orbifold singularities, and potential energies among such\nD-branes in the compact space that result from tree-level closed string\nexchanges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 06:30:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 09:24:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 02:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We formulate the source MT's pricing and load\nsharing problem as an optimization problem to minimize its expected energy\ncost. When the source MT cannot split its data package for a certain multimedia\napplication, we motivate the selected relay MT to forward the whole data\npackage by obtaining the optimal pricing through a dichotomous search\nalgorithm. When the source MT can split the data package, we jointly optimize\nthe pricing and load sharing with the relay MT and propose an alternating\noptimization algorithm that achieves near-optimal solution. Extensive numerical\nresults are provided to show that our proposed pricing mechanism can\nsignificantly decrease the source MT's expected energy cost, and load sharing\nis more cost-efficient when the size of the data package is large and the\naverage number of helping MTs is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 06:39:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Dec 2014 08:51:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 May 2015 07:58:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 07:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-05"}

While classical\napproaches (e.g. template fitting) are fine for objects of well-known classes,\nalternative techniques have to be developed to determine those that do not fit.\nTherefore a classification scheme should be based on individual properties\ninstead of fitting to a global model and therefore loose valuable information.\nAn important issue when dealing with large data sets is the outlier detection\nwhich at the moment is often treated problem-orientated. Aims: In this paper we\npresent a method to statistically estimate the redshift z based on a similarity\napproach. This allows us to determine redshifts in spectra in emission as well\nas in absorption without using any predefined model. Additionally we show how\nan estimate of the redshift based on single features is possible. As a\nconsequence we are e.g. able to filter objects which show multiple redshift\ncomponents. We propose to apply this general method to all similar problems in\norder to identify objects where traditional approaches fail. Methods: The\nredshift estimation is performed by comparing predefined regions in the spectra\nand applying a k nearest neighbor regression model for every predefined\nemission and absorption region, individually. Results: We estimated a redshift\nfor more than 50% of the analyzed 16,000 spectra of our reference and test\nsample. The redshift estimate yields a precision for every individually tested\nfeature that is comparable with the overall precision of the redshifts of SDSS.\nIn 14 spectra we find a significant shift between emission and absorption or\nemission and emission lines.

This enhanced surface warming in the\nArctic is partly because the extra heat is trapped in a thin layer of air near\nthe surface due to the persistent stable-stratification found in this region.\nThe warming of the surface air due to the extra heat depends upon the amount of\nturbulent mixing in the atmosphere, which is described by the depth of the\natmospheric boundary layer (ABL). In this way the depth of the ABL determines\nthe effective response of the surface air temperature to perturbations in the\nclimate forcing. The ABL depth can vary from tens of meters to a few kilometers\nwhich presents a challenge for global climate models which cannot resolve the\nshallower layers. Here we show that the uncertainties in the depth of the ABL\ncan explain up to 60 percent of the difference between the simulated and\nobserved surface air temperature trends and 50 percent of the difference in\ntemperature variability for the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5\n(CMIP5) ensemble mean. Previously the difference between observed and modeled\ntemperature was thought to be largely due to differences in individual models\ntreatment of large-scale circulation and other factors related to the forcing,\nsuch as sea-ice extent. While this can be an important source of uncertainty in\nclimate projections, our results show that it is the representation of the ABL\nin these models which is the main reason global climate models cannot reproduce\nthe observed spatial and temporal pattern of climate change. This highlights\nthe need for a better description of the stably-stratified ABL in global\nclimate models in order to constrain the current uncertainty in climate\nvariability and projections of climate change in the surface layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 08:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

While the convergence properties of the method for convex\nproblems have been well studied, far less is known in the nonconvex setting. In\nthis paper, for the direct adaptation of the method to minimize the sum of a\nproper closed function $g$ and a smooth function $f$ with a Lipschitz\ncontinuous gradient, we show that if the step-size parameter is smaller than a\ncomputable threshold and the sequence generated has a cluster point, then it\ngives a stationary point of the optimization problem. Convergence of the whole\nsequence and a local convergence rate are also established under the additional\nassumption that $f$ and $g$ are semi-algebraic. We also give simple sufficient\nconditions guaranteeing the boundedness of the sequence generated. We then\napply our nonconvex DR splitting method to finding a point in the intersection\nof a closed convex set $C$ and a general closed set $D$ by minimizing the\nsquared distance to $C$ subject to $D$. We show that if either set is bounded\nand the step-size parameter is smaller than a computable threshold, then the\nsequence generated from the DR splitting method is actually bounded.\nConsequently, the sequence generated will have cluster points that are\nstationary for an optimization problem, and the whole sequence is convergent\nunder an additional assumption that $C$ and $D$ are semi-algebraic. We achieve\nthese results based on a new merit function constructed particularly for the DR\nsplitting method.

We made this measurement over\nthe redshift range 0.01 < z < 0.2 (radial distances D ~ 50-800 Mpc).

We derive a local (z < 0.07, D < 300 Mpc)\nK-band luminosity density that agrees well with previously published studies.\nAt z > 0.07, we measure an increasing luminosity density that by z~ 0.1 rises\nto a value of ~1.5 times higher than that measured locally. This implies that\nthe stellar mass density follows a similar trend. Assuming that the underlying\ndark matter distribution is traced by this luminous matter, this suggests that\nthe local mass density may be lower than the global mass density of the\nuniverse at an amplitude and on a scale that is sufficient to introduce\nsignificant biases into the measurement of basic cosmological observables. At\nleast one study has shown that an under-density of roughly this amplitude and\nscale could resolve the apparent tension between direct local measurements of\nthe Hubble constant and those inferred by Planck team.

In a D2D configuration, devices in the\nnetwork can help hasten the recovery of the lost packets of other devices in\ntheir transmission range by sending network coded packets. Unlike previous\nworks that assumed fully connected network, this paper proposes a partially\nconnected configuration in which the decision should be made not only on the\npacket combinations but also on the set of transmitting devices. First, the\ndifferent events occurring at each device are identified so as to derive an\nexpression for the probability distribution of the decoding delay. The joint\noptimization problem over the set of transmitting devices and the packet\ncombinations of each is, then, formulated. The optimal solution of the joint\noptimization problem is derived using a graph theory approach by introducing\nthe cooperation graph and reformulating the problem as a maximum weight clique\nproblem in which the weight of each vertex is the contribution of the device\nidentified by the vertex. Through extensive simulations, the decoding delay\nexperienced by all devices in the Point to Multi-Point (PMP) configuration, the\nfully connected D2D (FC-D2D) configuration and the more practical partially\nconnected D2D (PC-D2D) configuration are compared.

We show that, when applying the concept of turbulent Jeans\nmass as the characteristic mass for fragmentation in a turbulent medium,\ninstead of the standard thermal Jeans mass for purely gravitational\nfragmentation, the peak of the IMF in such environments is shifted towards\nsmaller masses, leading to a bottom-heavy IMF, as suggested by various\nobservations. In very dense and turbulent environments, we predict that the\nhigh-mass tail of the IMF can become even steeper than the standard Salpeter\nIMF, with a limit for the power law exponent $\\alpha\\simeq -2.7$, in agreement\nwith recent observational determinations. This steepening is a direct\nconsequence of the high densities and Mach values in such regions but also of\nthe time dependence of the fragmentation process, as incorporated in the\nHennebelle-Chabrier theory.

In this framework, class\n$A$ of crypto-protocols reduces to protocol class $B$ in a scenario $X$, if for\nevery instance $a$ of $A$, there is an instance $b$ of $B$ and a secure\ntransformation $X$ that reproduces $a$ given $b$, such that the security of $b$\nguarantees the security of $a$. Here we employ this reductive framework to\nstudy the relationship between security in quantum key distribution (QKD) and\nquantum secure direct communication (QSDC). We show that replacing the\nstreaming of independent qubits in a QKD scheme by block encoding and\ntransmission (permuting the order of particles block by block) of qubits, we\ncan construct a QSDC scheme. This forms the basis for the \\textit{block\nreduction} from a QSDC class of protocols to a QKD class of protocols, whereby\nif the latter is secure, then so is the former. Conversely, given a secure QSDC\nprotocol, we can of course construct a secure QKD scheme by transmitting a\nrandom key as the direct message. Then the QKD class of protocols is secure,\nassuming the security of the QSDC class which it is built from. We refer to\nthis method of deduction of security for this class of QKD protocols, as\n\\textit{key reduction}. Finally, we propose an orthogonal-state-based\ndeterministic key distribution (KD) protocol which is secure in some local\npost-quantum theories. Its security arises neither from geographic splitting of\na code state nor from Heisenberg uncertainty, but from post-measurement\ndisturbance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 12:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 11:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

Using the standard pooling rules in situations where\nsampling variance should not be considered, leads to overestimation of the\nvariance of the estimates of interest, especially when the amount of\nmissingness is not very large.

While robust\nestimates of the coefficients' covariance extend the validity of hypothesis\ntests and confidence intervals, a clear interpretation of the coefficients is\nlacking if the mean structure of the model is miss-specified. We therefore\nsuggest a new intuitive and mathematical rigorous interpretation of the\ncoefficients that is independent from specific model assumptions. It relies on\na new population based measure of association. The idea is to quantify how much\nthe population mean of the dependent variable Y can be changed by changing the\ndistribution of the independent variable X. Restriction to linear functions for\nthe distributional changes in X provides the link to linear regression. It\nleads to a conservative approximation of the newly defined and generally\nnon-linear measure of association. The conservative linear approximation can\nthen be estimated by linear regression. We show how this interpretation can be\nextended to multiple regression and how far and in which sense it leads to an\nadjustment for confounding.

They are located in the\nlow-mass range of known transiting, giant planets. KOI-192b has a similar mass\n(0.29 M_Jup) but a longer orbital period of 10.3 days.

We simulate a three-prong SN survey: a z<0.35 nearby\nsample (8000 SNe), a 0.2<z<0.95 intermediate sample (8800 SNe), and a\n0.75<z<1.55 high-z sample (1700 SNe). The nearby and intermediate surveys are\nassumed to be conducted from the ground, while the high-z is a joint ground-\nand space-based survey. This latter survey, the \"Dark Energy Supernova\nInfra-Red Experiment\" (DESIRE), is designed to fit within 6 months of Euclid\nobserving time, with a dedicated observing program. We simulate the SN events\nas they would be observed in rolling-search mode by the various instruments,\nand derive the quality of expected cosmological constraints. We account for\nknown systematic uncertainties, in particular calibration uncertainties\nincluding their contribution through the training of the supernova model used\nto fit the supernovae light curves. Using conservative assumptions and a 1-D\ngeometric Planck prior, we find that the ensemble of surveys would yield\ncompetitive constraints: a constant equation of state parameter can be\nconstrained to sigma(w)=0.022, and a Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit of\n203 is found for a two-parameter equation of state. Our simulations thus\nindicate that Euclid can bring a significant contribution to a purely\ngeometrical cosmology constraint by extending a high-quality SN Hubble diagram\nto z~1.5. We also present other science topics enabled by the DESIRE Euclid\nobservations\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 14:30:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 14:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

For the solution of time-dependent partial\ndifferential equations, these methods can add another direction for concurrency\non top of spatial parallelization. The paper presents an implementation of the\ntime-parallel Parareal method in a C++ domain specific language for stencil\ncomputations (STELLA). STELLA provides both an OpenMP and a CUDA backend for a\nshared memory parallelization, using the CPU or GPU inside a node for the\nspatial stencils. Here, we intertwine this node-wise spatial parallelism with\nthe time-parallel Parareal. This is done by adding an MPI-based implementation\nof Parareal, which allows us to parallelize in time across nodes. The\nperformance of Parareal with both backends is analyzed in terms of speedup,\nparallel efficiency and energy-to-solution for an advection-diffusion problem\nwith a time-dependent diffusion coefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 14:34:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 12:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

The research is driven by the\nprospect of characterizing habitable planets beyond the Solar System in the\nnear future. In this work, I present a method to produce the disk-integrated\nsignature of planets that are described in their three-dimensional complexity,\ni.e. with both horizontal and vertical variations in the optical properties of\ntheir envelopes. The approach is based on pre-conditioned backward Monte Carlo\nintegration of the vector Radiative Transport Equation and yields the full\nStokes vector for outgoing reflected radiation. The method is demonstrated\nthrough selected examples inspired by published work at wavelengths from the\nvisible to the near infrared and terrestrial prescriptions of both cloud and\nsurface albedo maps. A clear advantage of this approach is that its\ncomputational cost does not appear to be significantly affected by\nnon-uniformities in the planet optical properties. Earth's simulated appearance\nis strongly dependent on wavelength; both brightness and polarisation undergo\ndiurnal variations arising from changes in the planet cover, but polarisation\nyields a better insight into variations with phase angle. There is partial\ncancellation of the polarised signal from the northern and southern hemispheres\nso that the outgoing polarisation vector lies preferentially either in the\nplane parallel or perpendicular to the planet scattering plane, also for\nnon-uniform cloud and albedo properties and various levels of absorption within\nthe atmosphere. The evaluation of circular polarisation is challenging; a\nnumber of one-photon experiments of 1E9 or more is needed to resolve\nhemispherically-integrated degrees of circular polarisation of a few times\n1E-5.

Within this\nframework, we propose i) a novel algorithm to efficiently separate, i.e.,\ndetect and localize, possible corruptions from a given suspicious data instance\nand ii) a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator to impute the corrupted data. As\na generalization to Euclidean distance, we also propose a novel distance\nmeasure, which is based on the ranked deviations among the data attributes and\nempirically shown to be superior in separating the corruptions. Our algorithm\nfirst splits the suspicious instance into parts through a binary partitioning\ntree in the space of data attributes and iteratively tests those parts to\ndetect local anomalies using the nominal statistics extracted from an\nuncorrupted (clean) reference data set. Once each part is labeled as anomalous\nvs normal, the corresponding binary patterns over this tree that characterize\ncorruptions are identified and the affected attributes are imputed. Under a\ncertain conditional independency structure assumed for the binary patterns, we\nanalytically show that the false alarm rate of the introduced algorithm in\ndetecting the corruptions is independent of the data and can be directly set\nwithout any parameter tuning. The proposed framework is tested over several\nwell-known machine learning data sets with synthetically generated corruptions;\nand experimentally shown to produce remarkable improvements in terms of\nclassification purposes with strong corruption separation capabilities. Our\nexperiments also indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform the typical\napproaches and are robust to varying training phase conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 14:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-02"}

This\nfeature would play an important 'damping' role in the market during downturns\n(periods of distress) since this connectivity pattern between firms lowers the\nchances of auto-amplifying (the propagation of) distress. In this paper we\nexplore a trade-network of industrial firms where the nodes are suppliers or\nbuyers, and the links are those invoices that the suppliers send out to their\nbuyers and then go on to present to their bank for discounting. The network was\ncollected by a large Italian bank in 2007, from their intermediation of the\nsales on credit made by their clients. The network also shows dissortative\nbehavior as seen in other studies on financial networks. However, when looking\nat the credit rating of the firms, an important attribute internal to each\nnode, we find that firms that trade with one another share overwhelming\nsimilarity. We know that much data is missing from our data set. However, we\ncan quantify the amount of missing data using information exposure, a variable\nthat connects social structure and behavior. This variable is a ratio of the\nsales invoices that a supplier presents to their bank over their total sales.\nResults reveal a non-trivial and robust relationship between the information\nexposure and credit rating of a firm, indicating the influence of the neighbors\non a firm's rating.

Examples are ubiquitous\nin the health and social sciences including patients in hospitals, employees in\nfirms, and students in schools. What is the optimal matching strategy in a\nclustered observational study? At first thought, one might start by matching\nclusters of individuals and then, within matched clusters, continue by matching\nindividuals. But as we discuss in this paper, the optimal strategy is the\nopposite: in typical applications, where the intracluster correlation is not\nperfect, it is best to first match individuals and, once all possible\ncombinations of matched individuals are known, then match clusters. In this\npaper we use dynamic and integer programming to implement this strategy and\nextend optimal matching methods to hierarchical and multilevel settings. Among\nother matched designs, our strategy can approximate a paired clustered\nrandomized study by finding the largest sample of matched pairs of treated and\ncontrol individuals within matched pairs of treated and control clusters that\nis balanced according to specifications given by the investigator. This\nstrategy directly balances covariates both at the cluster and individual levels\nand does not require estimating the propensity score, although the propensity\nscore can be balanced as an additional covariate. We illustrate our results\nwith a case study of the comparative effectiveness of public versus private\nvoucher schools in Chile, a question of intense policy debate in the country at\nthe present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 15:31:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 20:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-02"}

On these planets, the sub-stellar hemisphere\nexperiences perpetual daylight while the opposing anti-stellar hemisphere\nexperiences perpetual darkness. Because the night-side hemisphere has no direct\nsource of energy, the air over this side of the planet is prone to freeze out\nand deposit on the surface, which could result in atmospheric collapse.\nHowever, general circulation models (GCMs) have shown that atmospheric dynamics\ncan counteract this problem and provide sufficient energy transport to the\nanti-stellar side.\n  Here we use an idealized GCM to consider the impact of geothermal heating on\nthe habitability of synchronously rotating planets. Geothermal heating may be\nexpected due to tidal interactions with the host star, and the effects of\ngeothermal heating provide additional habitable surface area and may help to\ninduce melting of ice on the anti-stellar hemisphere. We also explore the\npersistence of atmospheric asymmetries between the northern and southern\nhemispheres, and we find that the direction of the meridional circulation (for\nrapidly rotating planets) or the direction of zonal wind (for slowly rotating\nplanets) reverses on either side of the sub-stellar point.

A proposal that attempts to deal with this problem, by\nintroducing \"the self-induced collapse hypothesis,\" has been introduced by D.\nSudarsky and collaborators in previous papers. In all these works, the collapse\nof the wave function of the inflaton mode is restricted to occur during the\ninflationary period. In this paper, we analyse the possibility that the\ncollapse happens during the radiation era. A viable model can be constructed\nunder the condition that the inflaton field variable must be affected by the\ncollapse while the momentum variable can or cannot be affected. Another\ncondition to be fulfilled is that the time of collapse must be independent of\n$k$. However, when comparing with recent observational data, the predictions of\nthe model cannot be distinguished from the ones provided by the standard\ninflationary scenario. The main reason for this arises from the requirement\nthat primordial power spectrum obtained for the radiation era matches the\namplitude of scalar fluctuations consistent with the latest CMB observations.\nThis latter constraint results in a limit on the possible times of collapse and\nensures that the contribution of the inflaton field to the energy-momentum\ntensor is negligible compared to the contribution of the radiation fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Sep 2014 22:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-08"}

The art historian,\ncritic, connoisseur, and curator have long held the esteemed position of the\naesthetic judge, their training, instinct, and eye part of the inimitable\nsubjective processes that Kant described as occurring upon artistic evaluation.\nAlthough the concept of intangible knowledge in regard to aesthetic theory has\nbeen much explored, little discussion has arisen in response to the development\nof new types of artificial intelligence as a challenge to the seemingly\nineffable abilities of the human observer. This paper examines the developments\nin the field of computer vision analysis of paintings from canonical movements\nwith the history of Western art and the reaction of art historians to the\napplication of this technology in the field. Through an investigation of the\nethical consequences of this innovative technology, the unquestioned authority\nof the art expert is challenged and the subjective nature of aesthetic judgment\nis brought to philosophical scrutiny once again.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 01:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-10"}
