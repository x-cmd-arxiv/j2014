The progenitor is a tight binary system composed by a\ncarbon-oxygen (CO) core and a neutron star (NS) companion. The explosion of the\nSN leads to hypercritical accretion onto the NS companion which reaches the\ncritical mass, hence inducing its gravitational collapse to a black hole (BH)\nwith consequent emission of the GRB. The first estimates of this process were\nbased on a simplified model of the binary parameters and the\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate. We present here the first full numerical\nsimulations of the IGC phenomenon. We simulate the core-collapse and SN\nexplosion of CO stars to obtain the density and ejection velocity of the SN\nejecta. We follow the hydrodynamic evolution of the accreting material falling\ninto the Bondi-Hoyle surface of the NS all the way up to its incorporation to\nthe NS surface. The simulations go up to BH formation when the NS reaches the\ncritical mass. For appropriate binary parameters the IGC occurs in short\ntimescales (100-1000s) owing to the combined effective action of the photon\ntrapping and the neutrino cooling near the NS surface. We also show that the\nIGC scenario leads to a natural explanation for why GRBs are associated only to\nSN Ic with totally absent or very little helium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 16:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

In fact, the prevalent theoretical view is that these are indeed the\nreal objects behind the curtain in astrophysical scenarios. There are several\nproposals for regularizing the classical singularity of black holes so that\ntheir formation and evaporation do not lead to information-loss problems. One\ncharacteristic is shared by most of these proposals: these regularly\nevaporating black holes present long-lived trapping horizons, with absolutely\nenormous evaporation lifetimes in whatever measure. Guided by the discomfort\nwith these enormous and thus inaccessible lifetimes, we elaborate here on an\nalternative regularization of the classical singularity, previously proposed by\nthe authors in an emergent gravity framework, which leads to a completely\ndifferent scenario. In our scheme the collapse of a stellar object would result\nin a genuine time-symmetric bounce, which in geometrical terms amounts to the\nconnection of a black-hole geometry with a white-hole geometry in a regular\nmanner. The two most differential characteristics of this proposal are: i) the\ncomplete bouncing geometry is a solution of standard classical general\nrelativity everywhere except in a transient region that necessarily extends\nbeyond the gravitational radius associated with the total mass of the\ncollapsing object; and ii) the duration of the bounce as seen by external\nobservers is very brief (fractions of milliseconds for neutron-star-like\ncollapses). This scenario motivates the search for new forms of stellar\nequilibrium different from black holes. In a brief epilogue we compare our\nproposal with a similar geometrical setting recently proposed by Haggard and\nRovelli.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 17:36:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 10:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

In particular, we have obtained a complete understanding of which\ndistinct types of symmetry fractionalization (symmetry classes) can be realized\nwithin this class of models, which are generalizations of Kitaev's\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code to arbitrary lattices. This question is motivated by\nearlier work of A. M. Essin and one of us (M. H.), where the idea of symmetry\nclassification was laid out, and which, for square lattice symmetry, produces\n2080 symmetry classes consistent with the fusion rules of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\ntopological order. This approach does not produce a physical model for each\nsymmetry class, and indeed there are reasons to believe that some symmetry\nclasses may not be realizable in strictly two-dimensional systems, thus raising\nthe question of which classes are in fact possible. While our understanding is\nlimited to a restricted class of models, it is complete in the sense that for\neach of the 2080 possible symmetry classes, we either prove rigorously that the\nclass cannot be realized in our family of models, or we give an explicit model\nrealizing the class. We thus find that exactly 487 symmetry classes are\nrealized in the family of models considered. With a more restrictive type of\nsymmetry action, where space group operations act trivially in the internal\nHilbert space of each spin degree of freedom, we find that exactly 82 symmetry\nclasses are realized.

We propose\na novel multiple access scheme that employs block-spreading based precoding at\nthe transmitters and sparsity-aware detection schemes at the base station. The\nproposed scheme is well suited for the emerging massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) systems, as well as conventional cellular systems with a\nsmall number of base-station antennas. The transmitters employ precoding in\ntime domain to enable the simultaneous transmissions of many users, which could\nbe even more than the number of receive antennas at the base station. The\nsystem is modeled as a linear system of equations with block-sparse unknowns.\nWe first adopt the block orthogonal matching pursuit (BOMP) algorithm to\nrecover the transmitted signals. We then develop an improved algorithm, named\ninterference cancellation BOMP (ICBOMP), which takes advantage of error\ncorrection and detection coding to perform perfect interference cancellation\nduring each iteration of BOMP algorithm. Conditions for guaranteed data\nrecovery are identified. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nscheme can accommodate more simultaneous transmissions than conventional\nschemes in typical small-packet transmission scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 18:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

In particular, the universality for moment\ngenerating functions of the proper time-delays (eigenvalues of Q) is\nestablished up to third order in the inverse number of scattering channels for\nsystems with and without time-reversal symmetry. Semiclassical results are then\nobtained for a further two orders. We also show the equivalence of random\nmatrix and semiclassical results for the second moments and for the variance of\nthe Wigner time delay at any channel number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 18:54:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 20:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-12"}

Reconstructed attractors of\na continuous signal are meant to be topologically equivalent representations of\nthe dynamics of the unknown dynamical system which generates the signal.\nSometimes, geometry of the attractor or its complexity may give important\ninformation on the system of interest. However, if the trajectories of the\nattractor behave as if they are not coming from continuous system or there\nexists many spike like structures on the path of the system trajectories, then\nthere is no way to characterize the shape of the attractor. In this article,\nthe traditional attractor reconstruction method is first used for two types of\nECG signals: Normal healthy persons (NHP) and Congestive Heart failure patients\n(CHFP). As common in such a framework, the reconstructed attractors are not at\nall well formed and hence it is not possible to adequately characterize their\ngeometrical features. Thus, we incorporate frequency domain information to the\ngiven time signals. This is done by transforming the signals to a time\nfrequency domain by means of suitable Wavelet transforms (WT). The transformed\nsignal concerns two non homogeneous variables and is still quite difficult to\nuse to reconstruct some dynamics out of it. By applying a suitable mapping,\nthis signal is further converted into integer domain and a new type of 3D plot,\ncalled integer lag plot, which characterizes and distinguishes the ECG signals\nof NHP and CHFP, is finally obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 19:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 10:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

Because of the profound connection between the flow geometry and\nthe topological properties of the nematic director, the theory sheds light on\nthe mechanisms leading to the proliferation of topological defects in active\nnematics and provides a number of testable predictions. A hypothesis, inspired\nby Onsager's statistical hydrodynamics, is finally introduced to account for\nthe equilibrium probability distribution of the vortex sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 19:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2015 14:23:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-04"}

If interpreted\nnaively, this constitutes a 2.95 sigma local excess (p-value=0.003), relative\nto the expectations of their background model. In order to further test this\ninterpretation, the Fermi-LAT team studied a large number of blank sky\nlocations and found TS>8.7 excesses to be more common than predicted by their\nbackground model, decreasing the significance of their dwarf excess to 2.2\nsigma (p-value=0.027).

A non-linear scheme to perturb Einstein's field equations around\nthe Robertson-Walker (R-W) metric is devised in order to find their\nnon-relativistic limit without losing their characteristic non-linearities. The\nresulting equation is used to numerically study the gravitational potential of\na cosmological perturbation and applied to a simple galactic model with an\nexponentially decreasing baryonic matter distribution. The non-relativistic\nlimit of GR in a R-W space-time produces a generalised Poisson equation for the\ngravitational potential which is non-linear, parabolic and heat-like. It is\nshown how its non-linearities generate an effective \"dark matter\" distribution\ncaused by both cosmological expansion and the dynamics of the perturbation's\ngravitational potential. It is also shown how this dynamical effect gets\ncompletely lost during a linearisation of Einstein's equations. The equation is\nthen used to successfully fit real galactic rotation curves numerically using a\nmatter distribution following the shape of a simple S\\'ersic luminosity\nprofile, common to most galaxies, thus without recourse to dark matter. A\nrelation for the dark to luminous matter ratio is found, explaining the\ndomination of dark matter in low-mass galaxies. A few rotation curves with a\nfaster than Newtonian decrease are also presented and successfully fitted,\nopening the way to a new possible interpretation of these phenomena in terms of\nan effective \"anti-gravitational\" dark matter distribution, purely geometrical\nin origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 20:20:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Sep 2014 15:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-16"}

Central galaxies with low-entropy, high-density\natmospheres frequently contain multiphase star-forming gas, while those with\nhigh-entropy, low-density atmospheres never do. The dividing line between these\ntwo populations in central entropy, and therefore central cooling time, is\namazingly sharp. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the dichotomy.\nOne points out that thermal conduction can prevent radiative cooling of cluster\ncores above the dividing line. The other holds that cores below the dividing\nline are subject to thermal instability that fuels the central AGN through a\ncold-feedback mechanism. Here we explore those hypotheses with an analysis of\nthe H-alpha properties of ACCEPT galaxy clusters. We find that the two\nhypotheses are likely to be complementary. Our results support a picture in\nwhich cold clouds inevitably precipitate out of cluster cores in which cooling\noutcompetes thermal conduction and rain down on the central black hole, causing\nAGN feedback that stabilizes the cluster core. In particular, the observed\ndistribution of the cooling-time to freefall-time ratio is nearly identical to\nthat seen in simulations of this cold-feedback process, implying that\ncold-phase accretion, and not Bondi-like accretion of hot-phase gas, is\nresponsible for the AGN feedback that regulates star formation in large\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 20:43:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

We recover the sequence in\nassociation of different SN types to the star-forming regions by using several\nindicators of the ongoing and recent SF related to both the ionized gas and the\nstellar populations. While the total ongoing SF is on average the same for the\nthree SN types, SNe Ibc/IIb tend to happen closer to star-forming regions and\noccur in higher SF density locations compared to SNe II and SNe~Ia, the latter\nshowing the weakest correlation. SNe~Ia host galaxies have on average masses\nthat are $\\sim$0.3-0.8~dex higher than CC SNe hosts due to a larger fraction of\nold stellar populations in the SNe~Ia hosts. Using the recent SN~Ia delay-time\ndistribution and the SFHs of the galaxies, we show that the SN~Ia hosts in our\nsample should presently produce a factor 2 more SNe~Ia than the CC~SN hosts.\nSince both types are in hosts with similar SF rate and hence similar CC~SN\nrate, this can explain the mass difference between the SN~Ia and CC~SN hosts,\nand reinforce the finding that at least part of SNe~Ia should originate from\nvery old progenitors. Comparing the mean SFH of the eight least massive\ngalaxies to that of the massive SF SN~Ia hosts we find that the low-mass\ngalaxies formed their stars over more extended time than the massive SN~Ia\nhosts.

The resulting color-magnitude diagram (CMD) reaches\nmore than a magnitude below the oldest main-sequence turnoff, allowing us to\nderive the star formation history (SFH) over the entire lifetime of the galaxy\nwith a timing precision of ~10% of the lookback time. Using a maximum\nlikelihood fit to the CMD we find that only ~10% of all star formation in\nAquarius took place more than 10 Gyr ago (lookback time equivalent to redshift\nz ~2). The star formation rate increased dramatically ~6-8 Gyr ago (z ~\n0.7-1.1) and then declined until the present time. The only known galaxy with a\nmore extreme confirmed delay in star formation is Leo A, a galaxy of similar\nM(HI)/M(stellar), dynamical mass, mean metallicity, and degree of isolation.\nThe delayed stellar mass growth in these galaxies does not track the mean dark\nmatter accretion rate from CDM simulations. The similarities between Leo A and\nAquarius suggest that if gas is not removed from dwarf galaxies by interactions\nor feedback, it can linger for several gigayears without cooling in sufficient\nquantity to form stars efficiently. We discuss possible causes for the delay in\nstar formation including suppression by reionization and late-time mergers. We\nfind reasonable agreement between our measured SFHs and select cosmological\nsimulations of isolated dwarfs. Because star formation and merger processes are\nboth stochastic in nature, delayed star formation in various degees is\npredicted to be a characteristic (but not a universal) feature of isolated\nsmall galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 23:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

However, the derived\nconstraints on models may be affected by large systematic errors introduced in\nthe various stages of modelling, namely, the macromodels, the microlensing\nmagnification maps, and the convolution with realistic disc profiles. In\nparticular, it has been known that different macromodels of the galaxy lens\nthat fit the observations equally well, can lead to different values of\nconvergence, $\\kappa$, and shear, $\\gamma$, required to generate magnification\nmaps. So far, 25 microlensed quasars have been studied using microlensing\ntechniques, where each system has been modelled and analyzed individually, or\nin small samples.

Results: The relativistic calculation gives a three-body binding\nenergy which is about 3% smaller than its non-relativistic counterpart.

This process has so far only\nbeen considered using the polarization-averaged gamma-gamma absorption cross\nsection. It is demonstrated that in the case of polarized gamma-ray emission,\nsubject to source-intrinsic gamma-gamma absorption by polarized target photons,\nthis may lead to a slight over-estimation of the gamma-gamma opacity by up to ~\n10 % in the case of a perfectly ordered magnetic field. Thus, for realistic\nastrophysical scenarios with partially ordered magnetic fields, the use of the\npolarization-averaged gamma-gamma cross section is justified for practical\npurposes, such as estimates of minimum Doppler factors inferred for gamma-ray\nbursts and blazars, based on gamma-gamma transparency arguments, and this paper\nquantifies the small error incurred by the unpolarized-radiation approximation.\nFurthermore, it is shown that polarization-dependent gamma-gamma absorption of\ninitially polarized gamma-rays can lead to a slight increase in the\npolarization beyond the spectral break caused by gamma-gamma absorption, to an\namount distinctly different from the change in polarization expected if the\nsame spectral break was produced by a break in the underlying electron\ndistribution. This may serve as a diagnostic of whether gamma-gamma absorption\nis relevant in sources such as gamma-ray bursts and blazars where the gamma-ray\nemission may be intrinsically highly polarized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 06:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The optimality of the LPPMs in the\ncontext of trajectory privacy is a novel contribution, and it is achieved by\nformulating the LPPM design problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game between the\nuser and the adversary.

In\nour previous paper entitled Faster 3-Periodic Merging Network we reduced twice\nthe time of merging on $3$-periodic networks, i.e. from $12\\log N$ to $6\\log\nN$, compared to the first construction given by Kuty{\\l}owski, Lory\\'s and\nOesterdikhoff.

To ensure the imaging performance during the\nmirror manufacturing, a fundamental step is predicting the mirror point spread\nfunction (PSF) from the metrology of its surface. Traditionally, the PSF\ncomputation in X-rays is assumed to be different depending on whether the\nsurface defects are classified as figure errors or roughness. [...] The aim of\nthis work is to overcome this limit by providing analytical formulae that are\nvalid at any light wavelength, for computing the PSF of an X-ray mirror shell\nfrom the measured longitudinal profiles and the roughness power spectral\ndensity (PSD), without distinguishing spectral ranges with different\ntreatments. The method we adopted is based on the Huygens-Fresnel principle for\ncomputing the diffracted intensity from measured or modeled profiles. In\nparticular, we have simplified the computation of the surface integral to only\none dimension, owing to the grazing incidence that reduces the influence of the\nazimuthal errors by orders of magnitude. The method can be extended to optical\nsystems with an arbitrary number of reflections - in particular the Wolter-I,\nwhich is frequently used in X-ray astronomy - and can be used in both near- and\nfar-field approximation. Finally, it accounts simultaneously for profile,\nroughness, and aperture diffraction. We describe the formalism with which one\ncan self-consistently compute the PSF of grazing-incidence mirrors, [...]\nFinally, we validate this by comparing the simulated PSF of a real Wolter-I\nmirror shell with the measured PSF in hard X-rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 11:49:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Sep 2014 15:49:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Oct 2014 15:56:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 10:23:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 2014 07:45:57 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 2014 09:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

In particular, late-time mid-infrared observations\nare something rare for type Ib/c SNe. In our study we find SN 2005at to be very\nsimilar photometrically and spectroscopically to another nearby type Ic SN\n2007gr, underlining the prototypical nature of this well-followed type Ic\nevent. The spectroscopy of both events shows similar narrow spectral line\nfeatures. The radio observations of SN 2005at are consistent with fast\nevolution and low luminosity at radio wavelengths. The late-time Spitzer data\nsuggest the presence of an unresolved light echo from interstellar dust and\ndust formation in the ejecta, both of which are unique observations for a type\nIc SN. The late-time Hubble observations reveal a faint point source coincident\nwith SN 2005at, which is very likely either a declining light echo of the SN or\na compact cluster.

We derive a host galaxy\nextinction of $A_{V} \\approx 1.9$ mag for SN 2005at, which is relatively high\nfor a SN in a normal spiral galaxy not viewed edge-on.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 12:13:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 18:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-04"}

This paper introduces the asymptotic concept of high\ndimensional efficiency which quantifies the detection power of different\nstatistics in such situations. While being related to classic asymptotic\nrelative efficiency, it is different in that it provides the rate at which the\nchange can get smaller with dimension while still being detectable. This also\nallows for comparisons of different methods with different null asymptotics as\nis for example the case in high-dimensional change point settings. Based on\nthis new concept we investigate change point detection procedures using\nprojections and develop asymptotic theory for how full panel (multivariate)\ntests compare with both oracle and random projections. Furthermore, for each\ngiven projection we can quantify a cone such that the corresponding projection\nstatistic yields better power behavior if the true change direction is within\nthis cone. The effect of misspecification of the covariance on the power of the\ntests is investigated, because in many high dimensional situations estimation\nof the full dependency (covariance) between the multivariate observations in\nthe panel is often either computationally or even theoretically infeasible. It\nturns out that the projection statistic is much more robust in this respect in\nterms of size and somewhat more robust in terms of power. The theoretic\nquantification by the theory is accompanied by simulation results which confirm\nthe theoretic (asymptotic) findings for surprisingly small samples. This shows\nin particular that the concept of high dimensional efficiency is indeed\nsuitable to describe small sample power, and this is demonstrated in a\nmultivariate example of market index data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 12:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2016 07:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-28"}

First, ongoing events can be triggered by photometric or\nastrometric alerts by GAIA. Second, events can be predicted using known high\nproper motion stars as lenses. This is much easier, as the location and time of\nan event can be forecast. Using the GAIA source density, we estimate that the\nsample size of high proper motion ($>300$ mas yr$^{-1}$) brown dwarfs needed to\nprovide predictable events during the 5 year mission lifetime is surprisingly\nsmall, only of the order of a hundred.

Kernel methods provide precisely that\npromise. In this paper, we offer an overview of kernel methods in regression\nsettings and compare such a method, regularized with principle components, to\nstepwise logistic regression.

A forecast of an FTA can be an important factor is a judge's\ndecision to release a defendant while awaiting trial and can influence the\nconditions imposed on that release. Forecasting accuracy matters, and our\nkernel approach forecasts far more accurately than stepwise logistic\nregression. The methods developed here are implemented in the R package kernReg\ncurrently available on CRAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 13:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-08"}

When the initial state of a quantum\nfield on the background of the star, is placed in the Unruh vacuum in the far\npast, then in the exterior Hawking radiation corresponds to a flux of positive\nenergy radiation travelling outwards from near the surface to future infinity.\nBased on pair creation, the evaporation of the collapsing star can be\nequivalently described by the absorption of an ingoing negative energy flux of\nradiation travelling towards the center of the star. Here, we are interested in\nthe evolution of the star during its collapse. Thus we include the backreaction\nof the negative energy Hawking flux in the interior geometry of the collapsing\nstar when writing the full 4-dimensional Einstein and hydrodynamic equations.\nHawking radiation emitted before the star passes through its Schwarzschild\nradius slows down and reverses the collapse of the star.

Their complexity often precludes analytic\nsolution, and we rely on stochastic simulation algorithms to estimate system\nstatistics. The Gillespie algorithm is exact, but computationally costly as it\nsimulates every single reaction. As such, approximate stochastic simulation\nalgorithms such as the tau-leap algorithm are often used. Potentially\ncomputationally more efficient, the system statistics generated suffer from\nsignificant bias unless tau is relatively small, in which case the\ncomputational time can be comparable to that of the Gillespie algorithm. The\nmulti-level method (Anderson and Higham, Multiscale Model. Simul. 2012) tackles\nthis problem. A base estimator is computed using many (cheap) sample paths at\nlow accuracy. The bias inherent in this estimator is then reduced using a\nnumber of corrections. Each correction term is estimated using a collection of\npaired sample paths where one path of each pair is generated at a higher\naccuracy compared to the other (and so more expensive). By sharing random\nvariables between these paired paths the variance of each correction estimator\ncan be reduced. This renders the multi-level method very efficient as only a\nrelatively small number of paired paths are required to calculate each\ncorrection term. In the original multi-level method, each sample path is\nsimulated using the tau-leap algorithm with a fixed value of $\\tau$. This\napproach can result in poor performance when the reaction activity of a system\nchanges substantially over the timescale of interest. By introducing a novel,\nadaptive time-stepping approach where $\\tau$ is chosen according to the\nstochastic behaviour of each sample path we extend the applicability of the\nmulti-level method to such cases. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method\nusing a number of examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 15:31:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 15:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-20"}

Many common approaches\nto detecting changepoints, for example based on penalised likelihood or minimum\ndescription length, can be formulated in terms of minimising a cost over\nsegmentations. Dynamic programming methods exist to solve this minimisation\nproblem exactly, but these tend to scale at least quadratically in the length\nof the time-series. Algorithms, such as Binary Segmentation, exist that have a\ncomputational cost that is close to linear in the length of the time-series,\nbut these are not guaranteed to find the optimal segmentation. Recently pruning\nideas have been suggested that can speed up the dynamic programming algorithms,\nwhilst still being guaranteed to find true minimum of the cost function. Here\nwe extend these pruning methods, and introduce two new algorithms for\nsegmenting data, FPOP and SNIP. Empirical results show that FPOP is\nsubstantially faster than existing dynamic programming methods, and unlike the\nexisting methods its computational efficiency is robust to the number of\nchangepoints in the data. We evaluate the method at detecting Copy Number\nVariations and observe that FPOP has a computational cost that is competitive\nwith that of Binary Segmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 15:44:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-08"}

The\nmethod we employ is to model the dynamical evolution of two isolated bars,\nhosted within the same galactic system, under their mutual gravitational\ninteraction. In this study we present an analytical treatment of the secular\nevolution of two bars that oscillate with respect one another. Two cases of\ninteraction, with and without geometrical deformation, are discussed. In the\nlatter case, the bars are described as modified Jacobi ellipsoids. These\ntriaxial systems are formed by a rotating fluid mass in gravitational\nequilibrium with its own rotational velocity and the gravitational field of the\nother bar. The governing equation for the variation of their relative angular\nseparation is then numerically integrated, which also provides the time\nevolution of the geometrical parameters of the bodies. The case of rigid,\nnon-deformable, bars produces in some cases an oscillatory motion in the bodies\nsimilar to that of a harmonic oscillator. For the other case, a deformable\nrotating body that can be represented by a modified Jacobi ellipsoid under the\ninfluence of an exterior massive body will change its rotational velocity to\nescape from the attracting body, just as if the gravitational torque exerted by\nthe exterior body were of opposite sign. Instead, the exchange of angular\nmomentum will cause the Jacobian body to modify its geometry by enlarging its\nlong axis, located in the plane of rotation, thus decreasing its axial ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 14:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-12"}

First, we apply, for the first\ntime, a framework borrowed from economics to a problem in the smart grid\nnamely, the design of signaling schemes between a consumer and an electricity\naggregator when these have non-aligned objectives. The consumer's objective is\nto meet its need in terms of power and send a request (a message) to the\naggregator which does not correspond, in general, to its actual need. The\naggregator, which receives this request, not only wants to satisfy it but also\nwants to manage the cost induced by the residential electricity distribution\nnetwork. Second, we establish connections between the exploited framework and\nthe quantization problem. Although the model assumed for the payoff functions\nfor the consumer and aggregator is quite simple, it allows one to extract\ninsights of practical interest from the analysis conducted. This allows us to\nestablish a direct connection with quantization, and more importantly, to open\na much more general challenge for source and channel coding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Sep 2014 12:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
