Circumstellar disks are known to contain a significant mass in dust\nranging from micron to centimeter size. Meteorites are evidence that individual\ngrains of those sizes were collected and assembled into planetesimals in the\nyoung solar system. Aims. We assess the efficiency of dust collection of a\nswarm of non-drifting planetesimals {\\rev with radii ranging from 1 to\n$10^3$\\,km and beyond. Methods. We calculate the collision probability of dust\ndrifting in the disk due to gas drag by planetesimal accounting for several\nregimes depending on the size of the planetesimal, dust, and orbital distance:\nthe geometric, Safronov, settling, and three-body regimes. We also include a\nhydrodynamical regime to account for the fact that small grains tend to be\ncarried by the gas flow around planetesimals. Results. We provide expressions\nfor the collision probability of dust by planetesimals and for the filtering\nefficiency by a swarm of planetesimals. For standard turbulence conditions\n(i.e., a turbulence parameter $\\alpha=10^{-2}$), filtering is found to be\ninefficient, meaning that when crossing a minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) belt\nof planetesimals extending between 0.1 AU and 35 AU most dust particles are\neventually accreted by the central star rather than colliding with\nplanetesimals. However, if the disk is weakly turbulent ($\\alpha=10^{-4}$)\nfiltering becomes efficient in two regimes: (i) when planetesimals are all\nsmaller than about 10 km in size, in which case collisions mostly take place in\nthe geometric regime; and (ii) when planetary embryos larger than about 1000 km\nin size dominate the distribution, have a scale height smaller than one tenth\nof the gas scale height, and dust is of millimeter size or larger in which case\nmost collisions take place in the settling regime. These two regimes have very\ndifferent properties: we find that the local filtering efficiency\n$x_{filter,MMSN}$ scales with $r^{-7/4}$ (where $r$ is the orbital distance) in\nthe geometric regime, but with $r^{-1/4}$ to $r^{1/4}$ in the settling regime.\nThis implies that the filtering of dust by small planetesimals should occur\nclose to the central star and with a short spread in orbital distances. On the\nother hand, the filtering by embryos in the settling regime is expected to be\nmore gradual and determined by the extent of the disk of embryos. Dust\nparticles much smaller than millimeter size tend only to be captured by the\nsmallest planetesimals because they otherwise move on gas streamlines and their\ncollisions take place in the hydrodynamical regime. Conclusions. Our results\nhint at an inside-out formation of planetesimals in the infant solar system\nbecause small planetesimals in the geometrical limit can filter dust much more\nefficiently close to the central star. However, even a fully-formed belt of\nplanetesimals such as the MMSN only marginally captures inward-drifting dust\nand this seems to imply that dust in the protosolar disk has been filtered by\nplanetesimals even smaller than 1 km (not included in this study) or that it\nhas been assembled into planetesimals by other mechanisms (e.g., orderly\ngrowth, capture into vortexes). Further refinement of our work concerns, among\nother things: a quantitative description of the transition region between the\nhydro and settling regimes; an assessment of the role of disk turbulence for\ncollisions, in particular in the hydro regime; and the coupling of our model to\na planetesimal formation model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 16:59:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 06:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

In the\npresent work, formation of ultra-thin gold films on fused silica is studied,\ndemonstrating how suppression of island formation and reduction of plasmonic\nabsorption can be achieved by treating substrates with (3-mercaptopropyl)\ntrimethoxysilane prior to deposition. Void-free fi lms with deposition\nthickness as low as 5.4 nm are realized and remain structurally stable at room\ntemperature. Based on detailed structural analysis of the fi lms by specular\nand diffuse X-ray reflectivity measurements, it is shown that optical\ntransmission properties of continuous ultra-thin films can be accounted for\nusing the bulk dielectric function of gold. However, it is important to take\ninto account the non-abrupt transition zone between the metal and the\nsurrounding dielectrics, which extends through several lattice constants for\nthe laterally continuous ultra-thin films (film thickness below 10 nm). This\nresults in a significant reduction of optical transmission, as compared to the\ncase of abrupt interfaces.

The success of approximation methods has hinged on the relative\nsimplicity of physical systems with respect to the exponentially complex worst\ncase.

In the present work, we employ additional 2D PIC simulations to address\nthe nature of the upstream oblique waves. We find that the waves are generated\nby the shock-reflected electrons via the firehose instability, which is driven\nby an anisotropy in the electron velocity distribution. We systematically\nexplore how the efficiency of wave generation and of electron acceleration\ndepend on the magnetic field obliquity, the flow magnetization (or\nequivalently, the plasma beta), and the upstream electron temperature. We find\nthat the mechanism works for shocks with high plasma beta (>20) at nearly all\nmagnetic field obliquities, and for electron temperatures in the range relevant\nfor galaxy clusters. Our findings offer a natural solution to the conflict\nbetween the bright radio synchrotron emission observed from the outskirts of\ngalaxy clusters and the low electron acceleration efficiency usually expected\nin low Mach number shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 20:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

Several theoretical models\nimplement AGN feedback to explain the observed galaxy luminosity function, and\npossibly the color and morphological transformation of spiral galaxies into\npassive ellipticals. To understand the importance of AGN feedback, a study of\nthe AGN populations in the radio-optical domain is crucial. A mass sequence\nlinking star-forming galaxies and AGN has been already noted in previous works,\nand it is now investigated as possible evolutionary sequence. We observed a\nsample of 119 intermediate-redshift (0.04<z<0.4) SDSS-FIRST radio emitters with\nthe Effelsberg 100-m telescope at 4.85 and 10.45 GHz and obtained spectral\nindices. We find indications of spectral index flattening in high-metallicity\nstar-forming galaxies, composite galaxies, and Seyferts. This \"flattening\nsequence\" along the [NII]-based emission-line diagnostic diagram is consistent\nwith the hardening of galaxy ionizing field, due to nuclear activity. After\ncombining our data with FIRST measurements at 1.4 GHz, we find that the\nthree-point radio spectra of Seyferts and LINERs show substantial differences,\nattributable to small radio core components and larger (arcsecond sized)\njet/lobe components, respectively. A visual inspection of FIRST images seems to\nconfirm this hypothesis. Galaxies along this sequence are hypothesized to be\ntransitioning from the active star-forming galaxies (blue cloud) to the passive\nelliptical galaxies (red sequence). This supports the suggestion that AGN play\na role in shutting down star-formation, and allow the transition from one\ngalaxy class to the other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 20:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

The influence of longitudinally polarized photons,\ndemanded by the need for infrared regularization via a non-zero photon mass, is\nincluded. The appropriate value of the photon mass depends on experimental\nconditions, and consequently the size of the electron (as defined by the slope\nof its Dirac form factor) bound in a hydrogen atom is found to be about four\ntimes larger than when the electron is free. The shape of the electron, as\ndetermined from the transverse density and generalized parton distributions is\nshown to not be round, and the free electron is shown to be far less round than\nthe bound electron.

Our model exhibits burst dynamics in\nwhich the clusters extends rapidly into regions with weak bonds. We associate\nthese bursts with the microseismic activity generated by fracking injections. A\nprincipal object of this paper is to study the role of anisotropic stress\ndistributions. Bonds in the $y$-direction are assigned higher random strengths\nthan bonds in the $x$-direction. We illustrate the spatial distribution of\nclusters and the spatial distribution of bursts (small earthquakes) for several\ndegrees of anisotropy. The results are compared with observed distributions of\nmicroseismicity in a fracking injection. Both our bursts and the observed\nmicroseismicity satisfy Gutenberg-Richter frequency-size statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 21:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-29"}

By giving Newton's arguments\na mathematical scaffolding and recasting his geometrical reasoning in the\nlanguage of differential calculus, Diderot provides a step-by-step solution\nguide to the problem and proposes experiments to settle the question about the\nappropriate form of $F_R$, which for Diderot quadratic in $v$, that is $F_R\n\\sim v^2$.\n  The solution of Diderot is presented in full detail and his results are\ncompared to those obtained from a Lindstedt-Poincare approximation for an\noscillator with quadratic damping. It is shown that, up to a prefactor, both\ncoincide. Some results that one can derive from his approach are presented and\ndiscussed for the first time. Experimental evidence to support Diderot's or\nNewton's claims is discussed together with the limitations of their solutions.\nSome misprints in the original memoir are pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 00:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

Most existing methods are\ndevoted to handling just one type of object and little attention has been paid\nto improving the computational efficiency. In recent years, level set evolution\n(LSE) has been shown to be very promising for object extraction in the\ncommunity of image processing and computer vision because it can handle\ntopological changes automatically while achieving high accuracy. However, the\napplication of state-of-the-art LSEs is compromised by laborious parameter\ntuning and expensive computation.

Thus a larger time\nstep can be used in the numerical scheme to expedite the proposed LSEs. In\ncontrast to existing methods, the proposed LSEs are significantly faster. Most\nimportantly, they involve much fewer parameters while achieving better\nperformance.

For masses above that of Saturn, transiting\nexoplanets have large radii indicative of the presence of a massive\nhydrogen-helium envelope. Theoretical models show that this envelope\nprogressively cools and contracts with a rate of energy loss inversely\nproportional to the planetary age. The combined measurement of planetary mass,\nradius and a constraint on the (stellar) age enables a global determination of\nthe amount of heavy elements present in the planet interior. The comparison\nwith stellar metallicity shows a correlation between the two, indicating that\naccretion played a crucial role in the formation of planets.

The fundamental question is whether this\ntransform is injective. We employ four different methods to approach this\nquestion, and each of them gives interesting results.\n  Direct calculation can be used in a ball, where the geometry is particularly\nsimple. If the reflecting part of the boundary is (piecewise) flat, a\nreflection argument can be used to reduce the problem to the usual X-ray\ntransform. In some geometries one can use broken rays near the boundary to\ndetermine the values of the unknown function at the reflector, and even\nconstruct its Taylor series. One can also use energy estimates -- which in this\ncontext are known as Pestov identities -- to show injectivity in the presence\nof one convex reflecting obstacle. Many of these methods work also on\nRiemannian manifolds.\n  We also discuss the periodic broken ray transform, where the integrals are\ntaken over periodic broken rays. The broken ray transform and its periodic\nversion have applications in other inverse problems, including Calder\\'on's\nproblem and problems related to spectral geometry.\n  A more detailed abstract can be found in the PDF file.

In general, the\ncontribution of proton nuclei in those models is highlighted, i.e. primary\ncosmic ray $\\alpha$-particles and heavy nuclei are neglected or scaled to\nprotons. The development of cosmic ray induced atmospheric cascade is sensitive\nto the energy and mass of the primary cosmic ray particle. The largest\nuncertainties in Monte Carlo simulations of a cascade in the Earth atmosphere\nare due to assumed hadron interaction models, the so-called hadron generators.\nIn the work presented here we compare the ionization yield functions $Y$ for\nprimary cosmic ray nuclei, such as protons, $\\alpha$-particles, Oxygen and Iron\nnuclei, assuming different hadron interaction models. The computations are\nfulfilled with the CORSIKA 6.9 code using GHEISHA 2002, FLUKA 2011, UrQMD\nhadron generators for energy below 80 GeV/nucleon and QGSJET II for energy\nabove 80 GeV/nucleon.

The influence of different atmospheric parametrizations,\nnamely US standard atmosphere, US standard atmosphere winter and summer\nprofiles on ion production rate is studied. Assuming realistic primary cosmic\nray mass composition, the ion production rate is obtained at several rigidity\ncut-offs - from 1 GV (high latitudes) to 15 GV (equatorial latitudes) using\nvarious hadron generators.

To this purpose, we modeled\nthe CO molecular bands using high-resolution K-band spectra. We find that MWC\n137 is surrounded by a detached cool (T = 1900 +-100 K) and dense (N = (3 +- 1)\nx 10^21 cm^(-2)) ring of CO gas orbiting the star with a rotational velocity,\nprojected to the line of sight, of 84 +- 2 km/s.

To remedy this problem, we extend the formalism to the superalgebra\nsu(2/2), which extends the SM to the left-right symmetric model (LRSM) and\naccommodates a ~126 GeV Higgs.

The non-decoupling phenomenon seen in the Higgs sector can then be\nreinterpreted in a new light as due to the mixing of low energy (SM) physics\nand high energy physics associated with quantum gravity, such as string theory.\nThe phenomenology of a TeV scale LRSM is also discussed, and we argue that some\nexciting discoveries may await us at the LHC, and other near-future\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 13:57:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 00:24:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2015 21:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-11"}

It is\nexpected that, like all the planetary bodies in our solar system, exoplanet\natmospheres will also have substantial cloud coverage, and evidence is mounting\nfor clouds in a number of hot Jupiters. In order to better characterise\nplanetary atmospheres we need to consider the effects these clouds will have on\nthe observed broadband transmission spectra. Here we examine the expected cloud\ncondensate species for hot Jupiter exoplanets and the effects of various grain\nsizes and distributions on the resultant transmission spectra from the optical\nto infrared, which can be used as a broad framework when interpreting exoplanet\nspectra. We note that significant infrared absorption features appear in the\ncomputed transmission spectrum, the result of vibrational modes between the key\nspecies in each condensate, which can potentially be very constraining. While\nit may be hard to differentiate between individual condensates in the broad\ntransmission spectra, it may be possible to discern different vibrational\nbonds, which can distinguish between cloud formation scenarios such as\ncondensate clouds or photochemically generated species. Vibrational mode\nfeatures are shown to be prominent when the clouds are composed of small\nsub-micron sized particles and can be associated with an accompanying optical\nscattering slope.

The DCR turns $\\mathcal{N}\\mathcal{P}$-Hard even\nif $k \\geq 2$ and $d\\geq 3$ are fixed, or in an all-terminal scenario when\n$d=2$. The traditional approach is to design either exponential exact\nalgorithms or efficient solutions for particular graph classes.\n  The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, a new recursive class of\ngraphs are shown to have efficient DCR computation. Second, we define a\nfactorization method in order to develop an exact DCR computation in general.\nThe approach is inspired in prior works related with the determination of\nirrelevant links and deletion-contraction formula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 15:30:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Oct 2014 10:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-02"}

In this\npaper it is shown that classical electrodynamics similarly predicts the Coulomb\nforce can be effectively canceled by part of the magnetic force that occurs\nbetween two similar particles each consisting of a point charge moving with\ncirculatory motion at the speed of light. Supposition of such motion is the\nbasis of the {\\em Zitterbewegung} interpretation of quantum mechanics. The\nmagnetic force between two luminally-circulating charges for separation large\ncompared to their circulatory motions contains a radial inverse square law part\nwith magnitude equal to the Coulomb force, sinusoidally modulated by the phase\ndifference between the circulatory motions. When the particles have equal mass\nand their circulatory motions are aligned but out of phase, part of the\nmagnetic force is equal but opposite the Coulomb force. This raises a\npossibility that the quantum force of Bohmian mechanics may be attributable to\nthe magnetic force of classical electrodynamics. It is further shown that\nnon-relativistic relative motion between the particles leads to modulation of\nthe magnetic force with spatial period equal to the de Broglie wavelength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 06:39:14 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2016 21:42:48 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 04:49:34 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 03:15:06 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Fri, 4 Jan 2019 16:51:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Oct 2014 14:06:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2014 20:00:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2015 19:37:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2015 14:50:11 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2015 07:54:45 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2015 04:47:53 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 03:19:13 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2016 08:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-07"}

No chemotaxis towards or\naway from TCE was found using an agarose in-plug bridge method. A second\nexperiment placed an inoculated aqueous layer on top of a sterile sand layer\nand showed that Geobacter migrated several centimeters in the sand layer in\njust $7$ days. A random motility coefficient for Geobacter in water of $0.24\n\\pm 0.02$ cm$^2$ day$^{-1}$ was fitted. A third experiment used a\ndiffusion-cell setup with a $5.5$ cm central sand layer separating a DNAPL from\nan aqueous top layer as a model source zone to examine the effect of random\nmotility on TCE DNAPL dissolution. With top layer inoculation, Geobacter\nquickly colonized the sand layer, thereby enhancing the initial TCE DNAPL\ndissolution flux. After $19$ days, the DNAPL dissolution enhancement was only\n$24\\%$ lower than with an homogenous inoculation of the sand layer. A\ndiffusion-motility model was developed to describe dechlorination and migration\nin the diffusion-cells. This model suggested that the fast colonization of the\nsand layer by Geobacter was due to the combination of random motility and\ngrowth on TCE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 18:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-31"}

In such cases\nthe concept of Representative Volume Element (RVE) on which classical continuum\nmodels rest ceases to exist and hence the smearing out of local inhomogeneities\nover the whole RVE is no longer correct. This paper presents a new approach to\ncapturing localised failure in quasi-brittle materials, focusing on the\nkinematic enrichment of the constitutive model to describe correctly the\nbehaviour of a volume element with an embedded localisation band. The resulting\nmodels possess an intrinsic length scale which in this case is the width of the\nembedded localisation band. The behaviour therefore scales with both the width\nof the localisation band and the size of the volume on which the model is\ndefined. As a consequence, size effects are automatically captured in addition\nto the model capability in capturing behaviour at the scale of the localisation\nzone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 05:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-02"}
