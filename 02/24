For predicting power for mix of\nworkloads we execute (build a regression model based on) experiments with\nrandom workloads. We observe the highest energy usage for CPU-intensive\nworkloads followed by memory-intensive workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2014 17:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-25"}

As these systems are expected to be\nCompton-thick, photons above 13.6 eV are largely absorbed and re-processed into\nlower energy bands. It follows that direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) are\nvery bright in the LW/NIR bands, typically outshining small high-redshift\ngalaxies by more than 10 times. Once the first DCBHs form, they then trigger a\nrunaway process of further DCBH formation, producing a sudden rise in their\ncosmic mass density. The universe enters the \"DCBH era\" at $z \\approx 20$ when\na large fraction of atomic-cooling halos are experiencing DCBH formation. By\ncombining the clustering properties of the radiation sources with Monte Carlo\nsimulations we show that in this scenario the DCBH mass density rises from\n$\\sim 5$~$M_\\odot$ Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z\\sim 30$ to the peak value $\\sim5\\times10^5\nM_\\odot$ Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z \\sim 14$ in our fiducial model. However, the\nabundance of \\textit{active} (accreting) DCBHs drops after $z \\sim 14$, as gas\nin the potential formation sites (unpolluted halos with virial temperature\nslightly above $10^4$~K) is photoevaporated. This effect almost completely\nsuppresses DCBH formation after $z\\sim 13$.

This, however, poses a problem for quantum systems,\nwhere the standard procedure requires the projective measurement of energy at\nthe beginning and the end of the protocol. Unfortunately, projective\nmeasurements, which are preferable from the point of view of theory, seem to be\ndifficult to implement experimentally. We demonstrate that, when using a\nparticular type of generalized energy measurements, the resulting work\nstatistics is simply related to that of projective measurements. This relation\nbetween the two work statistics entails the existence of modified transient\nfluctuation relations. The modifications are exclusively determined by the\nerrors incurred in the generalized energy measurements. They are universal in\nthe sense that they do not depend on the force protocol. Particularly simple\nexpressions for the modified Crooks relation and Jarzynski equality are found\nfor Gaussian energy measurements. These can be obtained by a sequence of\nsufficiently many generalized measurements which need not be Gaussian. In\naccordance with the central limit theorem, this leads to an effective error\nreduction in the individual measurements, and even yields a projective\nmeasurement in the limit of infinite repetitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 02:21:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 05:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}

While many statistical tools have been developed for\nfunctional data analysis, the issue of smoothing all functional observations\nsimultaneously is less studied. Existing methods often focus on smoothing each\nindividual function separately, at the risk of removing important systematic\npatterns common across functions. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian approach\nto smooth all functional observations simultaneously and nonparametrically. In\nthe proposed approach, we assume that the functional observations are\nindependent Gaussian processes subject to a common level of measurement errors,\nenabling the borrowing of strength across all observations. Unlike most\nGaussian process regression models that rely on pre-specified structures for\nthe covariance kernel, we adopt a hierarchical framework by assuming a Gaussian\nprocess prior for the mean function and an Inverse-Wishart process prior for\nthe covariance function. These prior assumptions induce an automatic\nmean-covariance estimation in the posterior inference in addition to the\nsimultaneous smoothing of all observations.

Compared with the convex optimization approaches,\nhowever, the non-convex approaches have more challenging convergence analysis.\nIn this paper, we study the convergence of a non-convex iterative thresholding\nalgorithm for solving sparse recovery problems with a certain class of\nnon-convex penalties, whose corresponding thresholding functions are\ndiscontinuous with jump discontinuities. Therefore, we call the algorithm the\niterative jumping thresholding (IJT) algorithm. The finite support and sign\nconvergence of IJT algorithm is firstly verified via taking advantage of such\njump discontinuity. Together with the assumption of the introduced restricted\nKurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz (rKL) property, then the strong convergence of IJT\nalgorithm can be proved.Furthermore, we can show that IJT algorithm converges\nto a local minimizer at an asymptotically linear rate under some additional\nconditions. Moreover, we derive a posteriori computable error estimate, which\ncan be used to design practical terminal rules for the algorithm. It should be\npointed out that the $l_q$ quasi-norm ($0<q<1$) is an important subclass of the\nclass of non-convex penalties studied in this paper. In particular, when\napplied to the $l_q$ regularization, IJT algorithm can converge to a local\nminimizer with an asymptotically linear rate under certain concentration\nconditions. We provide also a set of simulations to support the correctness of\ntheoretical assertions and compare the time efficiency of IJT algorithm for the\n$l_{q}$ regularization ($q=1/2, 2/3$) with other known typical algorithms like\nthe iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm and the iterative\nreweighted $l_{1}$ minimization (IRL1) algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 08:18:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 18:09:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 08:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-28"}

We performed two-dimensional period\nanalysis of its light curves by using a method called \"least absolute shrinkage\nand selection operator\" (Lasso) and \"phase dispersion minimization\" (PDM)\nanalysis, and we found that the period of negative superhumps systematically\nchanged between a superoutburst and the next superoutburst. The trend of the\nperiod change can beinterpreted as reflecting the change of the disk radius.\nThis change of the disk radius is in good agreement with the predicted change\nof the disk radius by the thermal-tidal instability (TTI) model. The normal\noutbursts within a supercycle showed a general trend that the rising rate to\nmaximum becomes slower as the next superoutburst approaches. The change can be\ninterpreted as the consequence of the increased gas-stream flow onto the inner\nregion of the disk as the result of the tilted disk. Some of the superoutbursts\nwere found to be triggered by a precursor normal outburst when the positive\nsuperhumps appeared to develop. The positive and negative superhumps co-existed\nduring the superoutburst. The positive superhumps were prominent only during\nfour or five days after the supermaximum, while the signal of the negative\nsuperhumps became strong after the middle phase of the superoutburst plateau.

We illustrate the method by deriving the equational conditions for\nvarious well-known linkages (Bricard's line symmetric linkage, Hooke's linkage,\nDietmaier's linkage, and recent a generalization of Bricard's orthogonal\nlinkage), starting from their bond diagrams; and by deriving the equations for\nanother bond diagram, thereby discovering a new mobile 6R linkage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 09:45:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 16:07:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2015 09:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

Allowing systems to be self-describing is one way to\nfacilitate this. To address the issues of reuse in designing evolvable systems,\nthis paper proposes a so-called description-driven approach to systems design.\nThis approach enables new versions of data structures and processes to be\ncreated alongside the old, thereby providing a history of changes to the\nunderlying data models and enabling the capture of provenance data. The\nefficacy of the description-driven approach is exemplified by the CRISTAL\nproject.

A pressure bump at the outer edge of the cavity allows dust\ngrains from the outer regions to stop their rapid inward migration towards the\nstar and efficiently grow to millimetre sizes. Dynamical interactions with\nplanet(s) have been one of the most exciting theories to explain the clearing\nof the inner disk. We look for evidence of the presence of millimetre dust\nparticles in transition disks by measuring their spectral index with new and\navailable photometric data. We investigate the influence of the size of the\ndust depleted cavity on the disk integrated millimetre spectral index. We\npresent the 3mm photometric observations carried out with PdBI of four\ntransition disks: LkHa330, UXTauA, LRLL31, and LRLL67. We use available values\nof their fluxes at 345GHz to calculate their spectral index, as well as the\nspectral index for a sample of twenty transition disks. We compare the\nobservations with two kind of models. In the first set of models, we consider\ncoagulation and fragmentation of dust in a disk in which a cavity is formed by\na massive planet located at different positions. The second set of models\nassumes disks with truncated inner parts at different radius and with power-law\ndust size distributions, where the maximum size of grains is calculated\nconsidering turbulence as the source of destructive collisions. We show that\nthe integrated spectral index is higher for transition disks than for regular\nprotoplanetary disks. For transition disks, the probability that the measured\nspectral index is positively correlated with the cavity radius is 95%.

In this paper we address the issue of automatically transforming a\nprogram written assuming synchronous query submission, to one that exploits\nasynchronous query submission. Our program transformation method is based on\ndata flow analysis and is framed as a set of transformation rules. Our rules\ncan handle query executions within loops, unlike some of the earlier work in\nthis area. We also present a novel approach that, at runtime, can combine\nmultiple asynchronous requests into batches, thereby achieving the benefits of\nbatching in addition to that of asynchronous submission. We have built a tool\nthat implements our transformation techniques on Java programs that use JDBC\ncalls; our tool can be extended to handle Web service calls. We have carried\nout a detailed experimental study on several real-life applications, which\nshows the effectiveness of the proposed rewrite techniques, both in terms of\ntheir applicability and the performance gains achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 10:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}

In this communication, we show that the resonances\ncan be derived by shifted Gaussian functions, whereas the unspecific nuclear\ninteraction compounds can be represented by an error function, which also\nprovides the asymptotic behavior. The energy shifts can be interpreted in terms\nof necessary domains of energy to excite typical nuclear processes. Thus the\nnecessary formulas referring to previous calculations of nuclear cross-sections\nwill be represented in section 2. The mass number AN determines the strong\ninteraction range. The threshold energy ETh of the energy barrier is determined\nby the condition Estrong = ECoulomb. A linear combination of Gaussians, which\ncontain additional energy shifts, and an error function incorporate a possible\nrepresentation of Fermi-Dirac statistics, which is applied here to nuclear\nexcitations and reaction with release of secondary particles. The new\ncalculation formula provides a better understanding of different types of\nresonances occurring in nuclear interactions with protons. The present study is\nmainly a continuation of previous papers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 10:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-25"}

The temperature dependence of the frequencies and\nlinewidths of the Ag, Eg, Tg(1), T g(2) modes in the paramagnetic phase can be\ndescribed in the framework of the Klemens approach.

At high exciting laser power the corresponding linewidths\nincrease at temperature decreasing below the Curie temperature.

Their power can be\nexplained by catastrophic instabilities occurring in the magnetic field\nconfiguration and the subsequent magnetic reconnection. By analogy with the\ncoronal mass ejection (CME) events on the Sun, we develop a theoretical model\nvia an analytic approach for magnetar giant flares. In this model, the rotation\nand/or displacement of the crust causes the field to twist and deform, leading\nto flux rope formation in the magnetosphere and energy accumulation in the\nrelated configuration. When the energy and helicity stored in the configuration\nreach a threshold, the system loses its equilibrium, the flux rope is ejected\noutward in a catastrophic way, and magnetic reconnection helps the catastrophe\ndevelop to a plausible eruption. By taking SGR 1806 - 20 as an example, we\ncalculate the free magnetic energy released in such an eruptive process and\nfind that it is more than $10^{47}$ ergs, which is enough to power a giant\nflare. The released free magnetic energy is converted into radiative energy,\nkinetic energy and gravitational energy of the flux rope. We calculated the\nlight curves of the eruptive processes for the giant flares of SGR 1806 - 20,\nSGR 0526-66 and SGR 1900+14, and compared them with the observational data. The\ncalculated light curves are in good agreement with the observed light curves of\ngiant flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 13:45:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Until recently, however, it was unknown\nwhether atoms heavier than hydrogen could diffuse rapidly enough on\ninterstellar grains to react with other accreted species. In addition, models\nstill require simple reduction as well as oxidation reactions to occur on\ngrains to explain the abundances of various molecules. In this paper we\ninvestigate O-atom diffusion and reactivity on a variety of astrophysically\nrelevant surfaces (water ice of three different morphologies, silicate, and\ngraphite) in the 6.5 - 25 K temperature range. Experimental values were used to\nderive a diffusion law that emphasizes that O atoms diffuse by quantum\nmechanical tunnelling at temperatures as low as 6.5 K. The rate of diffusion on\neach surface, based on modelling results, were calculated and an empirical law\nis given as a function of the surface temperature. Relative diffusion rates are\nk_H2Oice > k_sil > k_graph >> k_expected. The implications of an efficient\nO-atom diffusion over astrophysically relevant time-scales are discussed. Our\nfindings show that O atoms can scan any available reaction partners (e.g.,\neither another H atom, if available, or a surface radical like O or OH) at a\nfaster rate than that of accretion. Also, as dense clouds mature H2 becomes far\nmore abundant than H and the O/H ratio grows, the reactivity of O atoms on\ngrains is such that O becomes one of the dominant reactive partners together\nwith H.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 15:31:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jun 2014 10:11:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-06"}

In one dimension, QES states assume the form $\\Psi(x) =x^\\gamma\nP_d(x) {\\cal A}(x)$, where ${\\cal A}(x) > 0$ is known in closed form, and\n$P_d(x)$ is a polynomial to be determined. That is ${{\\Psi(x)}\\over\n{x^\\gamma{\\cal A}(x)}} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_nx^n$ truncates. The extension of\nthis \"truncation\" procedure to non-QES states corresponds to the Hill\ndeterminant method, which is unstable when the {\\it reference} function assumes\nthe physical asymptotic form. Recently, Handy and Vrinceanu introduced the\nOrthogonal Polynomial Projection Quantization (OPPQ) method which has non of\nthese problems, allowing for a unified analysis of QES and non-QES states. OPPQ\nuses a non-orthogonal basis constructed from the orthonormal polynomials of\n${\\cal A}$: $\\Psi(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^\\infty \\Omega_j {\\cal P}^{(j)}(x) {\\cal\nA}(x)$, where $\\langle {\\cal P}^{(j_1)}|{\\cal A}|{\\cal P}^{(j_2)} \\rangle =\n\\delta_{j_1,j_2}$, and $\\Omega_j = \\langle {\\cal P}^{(j)}|\\Psi\\rangle$.

The OPPQ quantization\ncondition, $\\Omega_{j} = 0$, is exact for QES states (provided $j \\geq d+1$);\nand is computationally stable, and exponentially convergent, for non-QES\nstates. OPPQ provides an alternate explanation to the Bender-Dunne (BD)\northogonal polynomial formalism for identifying QES states: they correlate with\nan anomalous kink behavior in the order of the finite difference moment\nequation associated with the $\\Phi = x^\\gamma {\\cal A}(x) \\Psi(x)$ {\\it\nBessis}-representation (i.e. a spontaneous change in the degrees of freedom of\nthe system).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 15:56:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}
