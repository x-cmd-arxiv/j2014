The new algorithm\nis robust to image misalignment and pixel corruption, and is able to reduce\nrequired gallery images to one sample per class. To compensate for the missing\nillumination information traditionally provided by multiple gallery images, a\nsparse illumination learning and transfer (SILT) technique is introduced. The\nillumination in SILT is learned by fitting illumination examples of auxiliary\nface images from one or more additional subjects with a sparsely-used\nillumination dictionary. By enforcing a sparse representation of the query\nimage in the illumination dictionary, the SILT can effectively recover and\ntransfer the illumination and pose information from the alignment stage to the\nrecognition stage.

The adopted procedure consists of determining\nclosure relations that allow to truncate the Poisson bracket of the\ndrift-kinetic system, expressed in terms of the moments, in such a way that the\nresulting operation is a Poisson bracket for functionals of the first two fluid\nmoments. The analysis is carried out for a class of full drift-kinetic\nequations and also for drift-kinetic systems in which a splitting between an\nequilibrium distribution function and a perturbation is performed. In the\nformer case we obtain that the only closure, not involving integral or\ndifferential operators, that leads to a Poisson bracket, corresponds to that of\nan ideal adiabatic gas made of molecules possessing one degree of freedom. In\nthe latter case, Hamiltonian closures turn out to be those in which the second\nmoment is a linear combination of the first two moments, which can be seen as a\nlinearization of the Hamiltonian closure of the full drift-kinetic case.

Most of the dynamo models suggest\nthat the toroidal magnetic field that emerges on the surface and forms sunspots\nis generated near the bottom of the convection zone, in the tachocline.\nHowever, there is a number of theoretical and observational problems with\njustifying the deep-seated dynamo models. This leads to the idea that the\nsubsurface angular velocity shear may play an important role in the solar\ndynamo. Using helioseismology measurements of the internal rotation and\nmeridional circulation, we investigate a mean-field MHD model of dynamo\ndistributed in the bulk of the convection zone but shaped in a near-surface\nlayer. We show that if the boundary conditions at the top of the dynamo region\nallow the large-scale toroidal magnetic fields to penetrate into the surface,\nthen the dynamo wave propagates along the isosurface of angular velocity in the\nsubsurface shear layer, forming the butterfly diagram in agreement with the\nParker-Yoshimura rule and solar-cycle observations. Unlike the flux-transport\ndynamo models, this model does not depend on the transport of magnetic field by\nmeridional circulation at the bottom of the convection zone, and works well\nwhen the meridional circulation forms two cells in radius, as recently\nindicated by deep-focus time-distance helioseismology analysis of the SDO/HMI\nand SOHO/MDI data.

The gravitational torque\non the disc from an inclined binary makes the disc precess around the binary\naxis, while the star-disc interaction torque due to the rotation-induced\nquadrupole makes the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes precess\naround each other. A significant star-disc misalignment angle can be generated\nfrom a small initial value as the star-disc system evolves in time such that\nthe two precession frequencies cross each other. This ``secular resonance''\nbehavior can be understood in a geometric way from the precession dynamics of\nspin and disc angular momenta. We derive the conditions for such resonance to\noccur, and find that they can be satisfied for reasonable protostar-disc-binary\nparameters. The evolution of star-disc inclination is also affected by mass\naccretion and by magnetic star-disc interaction torques, which can either\npromote or reduce star-disc misalignment. In general, as long as the initial\nbinary-disc inclination is greater than a few degrees, a variety of star-disc\nmisalignment angles can be generated within the disc lifetimes. We discuss the\nimplications of our results for the stellar spin orientations in binaries, for\nthe alignments/misalignments of protostellar discs and debris discs, and for\nthe stellar obliquities in exoplanetary systems. In particular, if hot Jupiters\nare produced by the Kozai effect induced by an external stellar companion, then\nit is likely that ``primordial'' star-disc misalignments are already generated\nby the star-disc-binary interactions. Even for systems where the Kozai effect\nis suppressed, misaligned planets may still be produced during the\nprotoplanetary disc phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2014 02:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We establish\nthe asymptotic distribution of the cross quantilogram and the corresponding\ntest statistic. The limiting distributions depend on nuisance parameters. To\nconstruct consistent confidence intervals we employ the stationary bootstrap\nprocedure; we show the consistency of this bootstrap. Also, we consider the\nself-normalized approach, which is shown to be asymptotically pivotal under the\nnull hypothesis of no predictability. We provide simulation studies and two\nempirical applications. First, we use the cross-quantilogram to detect\npredictability from stock variance to excess stock return. Compared to existing\ntools used in the literature of stock return predictability, our method\nprovides a more complete relationship between a predictor and stock return.\nSecond, we investigate the systemic risk of individual financial institutions,\nsuch as JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and AIG.

The RGF-distribution is completely determined by the a\npriori values of the total number of words in the text (M), the number of\ndistinct words (N) and the number of repetitions of the most common word\n(k_max). It is here shown that this maximum entropy prediction also describes a\ntext written in Chinese characters. In particular it is shown that although the\nsame Chinese text written in words and Chinese characters have quite\ndifferently shaped distributions, they are nevertheless both well predicted by\ntheir respective three a priori characteristic values. It is pointed out that\nthis is analogous to the change in the shape of the distribution when\ntranslating a given text to another language. Another consequence of the\nRGF-prediction is that taking a part of a long text will change the input\nparameters (M, N, k_max) and consequently also the shape of the frequency\ndistribution. This is explicitly confirmed for texts written in Chinese\ncharacters. Since the RGF-prediction has no system-specific information beyond\nthe three a priori values (M, N, k_max), any specific language characteristic\nhas to be sought in systematic deviations from the RGF-prediction and the\nmeasured frequencies. One such systematic deviation is identified and, through\na statistical information theoretical argument and an extended RGF-model, it is\nproposed that this deviation is caused by multiple meanings of Chinese\ncharacters. The effect is stronger for Chinese characters than for Chinese\nwords. The relation between Zipf's law, the Simon-model for texts and the\npresent results are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2014 11:47:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2015 07:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

In reality, most ISPs convert user traffic into NetFlow records for a\nconcise representation that does not include, for instance, any payloads. More\nimportantly, large and distributed networks are usually NAT'd, thus a few IP\naddresses may be associated to thousands of users.

Our existence result\nis proved by passing to the limit in a carefully tailored approximate problem,\nand by extending the obtained local-in-time solution by means of a refined\nprolongation argument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Feb 2014 14:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-11"}

Our motivation takes\nits source from a simple observation on the remarkable performances of both\nrandom and size-bounded reduction strategies. We first derive a simple\nreduction strategy, called Size-Bounded Randomized strategy (in short SBR),\nthat combines maintaing short clauses (of size bounded by k), while deleting\nrandomly clauses of size greater than k. The resulting strategy outperform the\nstate-of-the-art, namely the LBD based one, on SAT instances taken from the\nlast SAT competition.

The HII regions in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) offer ideal sites to study the stellar energy\nfeedback effects on dust because stars can be resolved, and the galaxy's nearly\nface-on orientation allows us to unambiguously associate HII regions with their\nionizing massive stars. The Spitzer Space Telescope survey of the LMC provides\nmulti-wavelength (3.6 to 160 $\\mu$m) photometric data of all HII regions. To\ninvestigate the evolution of dust properties around massive stars, we have\nanalyzed spatially-resolved IR dust emission from two classical HII regions\n(N63 and N180) and two simple superbubbles (N70 and N144) in the LMC. We\nproduce photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of numerous small\nsubregions for each region based on its stellar distributions and nebular\nmorphologies. We use DustEM dust emission model fits to characterize the dust\nproperties. Color-color diagrams and model fits are compared with the radiation\nfield (estimated from photometric and spectroscopic surveys). Strong radial\nvariations of SEDs can be seen throughout the regions, reflecting the available\nradiative heating. Emission from very small grains drastically increases at\nlocations where the radiation field is the highest, while polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs) appear to be destroyed. PAH emission is the strongest in\nthe presence of molecular clouds, provided that the radiation field is low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2014 21:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2014 21:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}
