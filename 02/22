This model faithfully represents key\nqualitative features of an experimental setup, where only a part of a nanowire\nis in immediate contact with a bulk superconductor, inducing topological\nsuperconductivity. It is shown that the Eilenberger equations represent a\nviable alternative to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory of the topological\nsuperconducting heterostructures and provide a much simpler quantitative\ndescription of some observables. For our setup, we obtain exact analytical\nsolutions for the quasiclassical Green's functions and the density of states as\na function of position and energy. The correlations induced by the boundary\ninvolve terms associated with both p-wave and odd-frequency pairing, which are\nintertwined and contribute to observables on an equal footing. We recover the\nsignatures of the standard Majorana mode near the end of the superconducting\nsegment, but find no such localized mode induced in the metallic segment.\nInstead, the zero-bias feature is spread out across the entire metallic part in\naccordance with the previous works. In shorter wires, the Majorana mode and\ndelocalized peak split up away from zero energy. For long metallic segments,\nnon-topological Andreev bound states appear and eventually merge together,\ngiving rise to a gapless superconductor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 16:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-23"}

First, the problem\nis studied in the symmetric linear deterministic IC (SLDIC) setting, and\nachievable schemes are proposed, based on interference cancelation, relaying of\nthe other user's data bits, and transmission of random bits. In the proposed\nachievable scheme, the limited rate cooperative link is used to share a\ncombination of data bits and random bits depending on the model parameters.\nOuter bounds on the secrecy rate are also derived, using a novel partitioning\nof the encoded messages and outputs depending on the relative strength of the\nsignal and the interference. The inner and outer bounds are derived under all\npossible parameter settings. It is found that, for some parameter settings, the\ninner and outer bounds match, yielding the capacity of the SLDIC under\ntransmitter cooperation and secrecy constraints. In some other scenarios, the\nachievable rate matches with the capacity region of the 2-user SLDIC without\nsecrecy constraints derived by Wang and Tse [1]; thus, the proposed scheme\noffers secrecy for free, in these cases. Inspired by the achievable schemes and\nouter bounds in the deterministic case, achievable schemes and outer bounds are\nderived in the Gaussian case. The proposed achievable scheme for the Gaussian\ncase is based on Marton's coding scheme and stochastic encoding along with\ndummy message transmission.

One\nimportant question is whether the photosphere component can interpret the\ntypical ``Band'' function of GRBs with a typical low energy photon spectral\nindex $\\alpha \\sim -1$. We perform a detailed study of the photosphere emission\nspectrum by progressively introducing several physical ingredients previously\nnot fully incorporated, including the probability distribution of the location\nof a dynamically evolving photosphere, superposition of emission from an\nequal-arrival-time ``volume'' in a continuous wind, the evolution of optical\ndepth of a wind with finite but evolving outer boundary, as well as the effect\nof different top-hat wind luminosity ($L_w$) profiles. By assuming a co-moving\nblackbody spectrum emerging from the photosphere, we find that for an outflow\nwith a constant or increasing $L_w$, the low-energy spectrum below the peak\nenergy ($E_{p}$), can be modified to $F_\\nu \\sim \\nu^{1.5}$ ($\\alpha \\sim\n+0.5$). A softer ($-1<\\alpha<+0.5$) or flat ($\\alpha=-1$) spectrum can be\nobtained during the $L_w$ decreasing phase or high-latitude-emission-dominated\nphase. We also study the evolution of $E_{p}$ as a function of wind and\nphotosphere luminosity in this photosphere model. An $E_p-L$ tracking pattern\ncan be reproduced if a certain positive dependence between the dimensionless\nentropy $\\eta$ and $L_w$ is introduced. However, the hard-to-soft evolution\npattern cannot be reproduced unless a contrived condition is invoked. In order\nto interpret the Band spectrum, a more complicated photosphere model or a\ndifferent energy dissipation and radiation mechanism are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 17:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The RITA scheme works by a relativistic laser\ninducing transparency to densities higher than the cold-electron critical\ndensity, while the background heavy ions are stationary. The rising laser pulse\ncreates a traveling acceleration structure at the relativistic critical density\nby ponderomotively driving a local electron density inflation, creating an\nelectron snowplow and a co-propagating electrostatic potential. The snowplow\nadvances with a velocity determined by the rate of the rise of the laser's\nintensity envelope and the heavy-ion-plasma density gradient scale length. The\nrising laser is incrementally rendered transparent to higher densities such\nthat the relativistic-electron plasma frequency is resonant with the laser\nfrequency. In the snowplow frame, trace density protons reflect off the\nelectrostatic potential and get snowplowed, while the heavier background ions\nare relatively unperturbed.

The least action principle (or the principle of virtual\nwork) is applied to derive the conservative part of the dynamics, with a focus\non the reversible part of the stress tensor arising from the mixing energies.\nThe dissipative part of the dynamics is then introduced through a dissipation\nfunction in the energy law, in line with the Onsager principle of least energy\ndissipation. The final system, formed by a set of coupled time-dependent\npartial differential equations, reflects a balance among various conservative\nand dissipative forces and governs the evolution of velocity and phase fields.\nTo demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model, a few two-dimensional\nsimulations have been carried out, including (1) the force balance at the\nthree-phase contact line in equilibrium, (2) a rising bubble penetrating a\nfluid-fluid interface, and (3) a solid particle falling in a binary fluid.

For example, models where the gauginos are Dirac instead of Majorana\nhave recently received more attention. Beside allowing for a supersoft SUSY\nbreaking mechanism where the gauginos only provide finite threshold corrections\nto scalar masses, the cross section for the production of a squark pairs is\nreduced. In addition, Dirac gauginos can be used to build models that possess a\nU(1)R symmetry. This symmetry can then be identified with a lepton number,\nleading to models that are quite different from conventional scenarios. The\nsneutrinos in these models can acquire a vev and give mass to the leptons and\nthe down-type squark. The phenomenology is novel, combining signatures that are\ntypical of R-parity violating scenarios with signatures arising from\nleptoquarks.

The planet is\nonly 1.5 times the separation from its host star at which it would be destroyed\nby Roche lobe overflow, and has a predicted remaining lifetime of just ~40 Myr,\nassuming a tidal dissipation quality factor of Q'*=10^6. Q'* is a key factor in\ndetermining how frictional processes within a host star affect the orbital\nevolution of its companion giant planets, but it is currently poorly\nconstrained by observations.

Initially, LESA seems to develop stochastically from convective\nfluctuations, it exists for hundreds of milliseconds or more, and it persists\nduring violent shock sloshing associated with the standing accretion shock\ninstability. The nue minus antinue flux asymmetry originates mainly below the\nneutrinosphere in a region of pronounced proto-neutron star (PNS) convection,\nwhich is stronger in the hemisphere of enhanced lepton-number flux. On this\nside of the PNS, the mass-accretion rate of lepton-rich matter is larger,\namplifying the lepton-emission asymmetry, because the spherical stellar infall\ndeflects on a dipolar deformation of the stalled shock. The increased shock\nradius in the hemisphere of less mass accretion and minimal lepton-number flux\n(antinue flux maximum) is sustained by stronger convection on this side, which\nis boosted by stronger neutrino heating because the average antinue energy is\nhigher than the average nue energy. Asymmetric heating thus supports the global\ndeformation despite extremely nonstationary convective overturn behind the\nshock. While these different elements of LESA form a consistent picture, a full\nunderstanding remains elusive at present.

While much of the existing research\nhas focused on extracting robust and secure content descriptors, a significant\nopen challenge still remains: Most existing video hashing methods are fallible\nto temporal desynchronization. That is, when the query video results by\ndeleting or inserting some frames from the reference video, most existing\nmethods assume the positions of the deleted (or inserted) frames are either\nperfectly known or reliably estimated. This assumption may be okay under\ntypical transcoding and frame-rate changes but is highly inappropriate in\nadversarial scenarios such as anti-piracy video search. For example, an illegal\nuploader will try to bypass the 'piracy check' mechanism of YouTube/Dailymotion\netc by performing a cleverly designed non-uniform resampling of the video. We\npresent a new solution based on dynamic time warping (DTW), which can implement\nautomatic synchronization and can be used together with existing video hashing\nmethods. The second contribution of this paper is to propose a new robust\nfeature extraction method called flow hashing (FH), based on frame averaging\nand optical flow descriptors. Finally, a fusion mechanism called distance\nboosting is proposed to combine the information extracted by DTW and FH.\nExperiments on real video collections show that such a hash extraction and\ncomparison enables unprecedented robustness under both spatial and temporal\nattacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 21:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-25"}

For achieving this goal, past work has concentrated\non force control algorithms at the system level with limited focus on\nperformance expansion at the actuator level. We present a comprehensive\nliterature review on robot force control, including algorithms, specialized\nactuators, and robot control software. A robot force control testbed was\ndeveloped using Schunk's PowerCube 6-DOF Arm and a six-axis ATI force/torque\nsensor. Using parameter identification experiments, manipulator module inertias\nand the motor torque constant were estimated. Experiments were conducted to\nstudy the practical issues involved in implementing stable contact transitions\nand programmable endpoint impedance. Applications to human augmentation,\nvirtual fixtures, and teleoperation are discussed. These experiments are used\nas a vehicle to understand the performance improvement achievable at the\nactuator level. The approach at UTRRG has been to maximize the choices within\nthe actuator to enhance its intelligence. Drawing on this 20-year research\nhistory in electromechanical actuator architecture, we propose a new concept\nthat mixes two inputs, distinct in their velocity ratios, within the same dual\nactuator called a Force/Motion Actuator (FMA). Detailed kinematic and dynamic\nmodels of this dual actuator are developed. The actuator performance is\nevaluated using simulations with an output velocity specification and resolving\ninput trajectories using a minimum-norm solution. It is shown that a design\nchoice of 14:1 motion scaling between the two inputs results in good\nsensitivity to output force disturbances without compromising velocity tracking\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2014 02:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-25"}

In fact, hypercube\ntheory is based on a typical sequence decomposition and it is a very important\ntool in investigating the critical error linear complexity spectrum proposed by\nEtzion et al. To demonstrate the importance of hypercube theory, we first give\na standard hypercube decomposition based on a well-known algorithm for\ncomputing linear complexity and show that the linear complexity of the first\nhypercube in the decomposition is equal to the linear complexity of the\noriginal sequence.

For several important systems, like modal logic S5, failure of\nstructural completeness is caused only by the underivability of passive rules,\ni.e. rules that can not be applied to theorems of the system. Neglecting\npassive rules leads to the notion of almost structural completeness, that\nmeans, derivablity of admissible non-passive rules. Almost structural\ncompleteness for quasivarieties and varieties of general algebras is\ninvestigated here by purely algebraic means. The results apply to all\nalgebraizable deductive systems.\n  Firstly, various characterizations of almost structurally complete\nquasivarieties are presented. Two of them are general: expressed with finitely\npresented algebras, and with subdirectly irreducible algebras. One is\nrestricted to quasivarieties with finite model property and equationally\ndefinable principal relative congruences, where the condition is verifiable on\nfinite subdirectly irreducible algebras.\n  Secondly, examples of almost structurally complete varieties are provided\nParticular emphasis is put on varieties of closure algebras, that are known to\nconstitute adequate semantics for normal extensions of S4 modal logic. A\ncertain infinite family of such almost structurally complete, but not\nstructurally complete, varieties is constructed. Every variety from this family\nhas a finitely presented unifiable algebra which does not embed into any free\nalgebra for this variety. Hence unification in it is not unitary. This shows\nthat almost structural completeness is strictly weaker than projective\nunification for varieties of closure algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2014 08:42:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 20:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-26"}

This complete approach is demonstrated by means of the\nOxazolines and Oxazoles derivatives as antituberculosis agent for nonlinear\nregression benchmark. The results are compared with results obtained by\nneuro-fuzzy i.e. ANFIS algorithm and advanced fuzzyy clustering techniques i.e\nFMID toolbox .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2014 02:40:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-13"}

In the\nterminology given in the previous paper, the one consists of \"quasi-leptons\",\nand the other consists of \"quasi-quarks\" which are massless and have\nanisotropic dispersion relations characterized by constant vector potentials. A\nlow energy approximation shows that quasi fermions of the latter type are\ninterpretable as collective excitations of the BCS-type vacuum, the Cooper\npairs of which form vector mesons. The same approximation reproduces further a\ngeneration structure similar to that of real quarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2014 04:23:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 02:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-21"}
