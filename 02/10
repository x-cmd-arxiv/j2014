We found the human movements\nfollowed truncated power-law distributions during and after Hurricane Sandy,\nalthough the {\\beta} value was noticeably larger during the first 24 hours\nafter the storm struck.

We find the\nextreme value statistics of work for several singular elastic potentials, as\nwell as the mean and the dispersion of work near the coil-stretch transition.\nThe dispersion shows a maximum at the transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2014 01:37:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 03:19:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Dec 2014 04:08:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 20:04:16 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 02:20:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Such nonlinear terms\nhave an on-line complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(k^{p+1})$, where $k$ is the\ndimension of POD basis, and therefore is independent of full space dimension.\nHowever it is efficient only for quadratic nonlinear terms since for higher\nnonlinearities standard POD proves to be less time consuming once the POD basis\ndimension $k$ is increased. Numerical experiments are carried out with a two\ndimensional shallow water equation (SWE) test problem to compare the\nperformance of tensorial POD, standard POD, and POD/Discrete Empirical\nInterpolation Method (DEIM).

Prior investigation into their\norigin has focused on two source regions: the Oort cloud and the Scattered\nDisc. From the former it has been difficult to reproduce the non-isotropic,\nprograde skew in the inclination distribution of the observed HTCs without\ninvoking a multi-component Oort cloud model and specific fading of the comets.\nThe Scattered Disc origin fares better but suffers from needing an order of\nmagnitude more mass than is currently advocated by theory and observations.\nHere we revisit the Oort cloud origin and include cometary fading. Our\nobservational sample stems from the JPL catalogue. We only keep comets\ndiscovered and observed after 1950 but place no a priori restriction on the\nmaximum perihelion distance of observational completeness. We then numerically\nevolve half a million comets from the Oort cloud through the realm of the giant\nplanets and keep track of their number of perihelion passages with perihelion\ndistance q<2.5AU, below which the activity is supposed to increase\nconsiderably. We can simultaneously fit the HTC inclination and semi-major axis\ndistribution very well with a power law fading function of the form m^-k, where\nm is the number of perihelion passages with q<2.5 AU and k is the fading index.\nWe match both the inclination and semi-major axis distributions when k~1 and\nthe maximum imposed perihelion distance of the observed sample is q~1.8AU. The\nvalue of k is higher than the one obtained for the Long-Period Comets (LPCs),\nwith k~0.7. This increase in k is most likely the result of cometary surface\nprocesses. We argue the HTC sample is now most likely complete for q<1.8AU. We\ncalculate that the steady-state number of active HTCs with diameter D>2.3km and\nq<1.8AU is of the order of 100.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2014 03:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Using the model, we explore a preventative feedback model, in\nwhich the circum-halo medium is assumed to be preheated up to a certain entropy\nlevel by early starbursts or other processes, and compare it with an ejective\nfeedback model, in which baryons are first accreted into dark matter halos and\nsubsequently ejected out by feedback. The model demonstrates that when the\nmedium is preheated to an entropy comparable to the halo virial entropy the\nbaryon accretion can be largely reduced and delayed. In addition, the preheated\nmedium can establish an extended low density gaseous halo when it accretes into\nthe dark matter halos, and result in a specific angular momentum of the cooling\ngas large enough to form central disks as extended as those observed. Combined\nwith simulated halo assembly histories, the preventative feedback model can\nreproduce remarkably well a number of observational scaling relations. These\ninclude the cold baryon (stellar plus cold gas) mass fraction-halo mass\nrelations, star formation histories, disk size-stellar mass relation and its\nevolution, and the number density of low-mass galaxies as a function of\nredshift. In contrast, the conventional ejective feedback model fails to\nreproduce these observational trends. Using the model, we demonstrate that the\nproperties of disk galaxies are closely tied to the thermal state of hot halo\ngas and even possibly the circum-halo medium, which suggests that observational\ndata for the disk properties and circum-galactic hot/warm medium may jointly\nprovide interesting constraints for galaxy formation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2014 05:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We first derive the minimum backhaul\nlink rate required to achieve the same capacity scaling law as in the\ninfinite-capacity backhaul link case. Assuming an arbitrary rate scaling of\neach backhaul link, a generalized achievable throughput scaling law is then\nanalyzed in the network based on using one of pure multihop, hierarchical\ncooperation, and two infrastructure-supported routing protocols, and moreover,\nthree-dimensional information-theoretic operating regimes are explicitly\nidentified according to the three scaling parameters.

We thus extend the classical agenda by allowing graded, or fuzzy,\nattributes instead of Boolean attributes in case of attribute implications, and\nallowing approximate match based on degrees of similarity instead of exact\nmatch in case of functional dependencies. In a sense, we move from bivalence,\ninherently present in the now-available theories of dependencies, to a more\nflexible setting that involves grades. Such a shift has far-reaching\nconsequences. We argue that a reasonable theory of dependencies may be\ndeveloped by making use of mathematical fuzzy logic. Namely, the theory of\ndependencies is then based on a solid logic calculus the same way the classical\ndependencies are based on classical logic. For instance, rather than handling\ndegrees of similarity in an ad hoc manner, we consistently treat them as truth\nvalues, the same way as true (match) and false (mismatch) are treated in\nclassical theories. In addition, several notions intuitively embraced in the\npresence of grades, such as a degree of validity of a particular dependence or\na degree of entailment, naturally emerge and receive a conceptually clean\ntreatment in the presented approach. In the paper, we discuss motivations,\nprovide basic notions of syntax and semantics, and develop basic results which\ninclude entailment of dependencies, associated closure structures, a logic of\ndependencies with two versions of completeness theorem, results and algorithms\nregarding complete non-redundant sets of dependencies, relationship to and a\npossible reductionist interface to classical dependencies, and relationship to\nfunctional dependencies over domains with similarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2014 09:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-11"}

The perceived processing time of a request is thus composed of\nthe time needed to route the request to the server and the true processing\ntime. Once a request reaches a target server, the processing time depends on\nthe total load of that server; this dependency is described by a load function.\nWe consider a broad class of load functions; we just require that they are\nconvex and two times differentiable. In particular our model can be applied to\nheterogeneous systems in which every server has a different load function. This\napproach allows us not only to generalize results for queuing theory and for\nbatches of requests, but also to use empirically-derived load functions,\nmeasured in a system under stress-testing. The optimal assignment of requests\nto servers is communication-balanced, i.e. for any pair of non\nperfectly-balanced servers, the reduction of processing time resulting from\nmoving a single request from the overloaded to underloaded server is smaller\nthan the additional communication latency. We present a centralized and a\ndecentralized algorithm for optimal load balancing. We prove bounds on the\nalgorithms' convergence. To the best of our knowledge these bounds were not\nknown even for the special cases studied previously (queuing theory and batches\nof requests). Both algorithms are any-time algorithms. In the decentralized\nalgorithm, each server balances the load with a randomly chosen peer. Such\nalgorithm is very robust to failures. We prove that the decentralized algorithm\nperforms locally-optimal steps. Our work extends the currently known results by\nconsidering a broad class of load functions and by establishing theoretical\nbounds on the algorithms' convergence. These results are applicable for servers\nwhose characteristics under load cannot be described by a standard mathematical\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2014 10:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-11"}

Observations of XZ Tau made with the VLA in 2004 appeared\nto show a triple system, with XZ Tau A resolved into two sources, XZ Tau A and\nXZ Tau C. The angular separation of XZ Tau A and C (0.09 arcsec) suggested a\nprojected orbital separation of around 13 AU with a possible orbital period of\naround 40 yr. Our observations were obtained approximately 8 yr later, a fifth\nof this putative orbital period, and should therefore allow us to constrain the\norbit of XZ Tau C, and evaluate the possibility that a recent periastron\npassage of C coincided with the launch of extended optical outflows from XZ Tau\nA.

Components A and B\nare detected with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than ten; their orbits are\nconsistent with previous studies, although the emission from XZ Tau A appears\nto be weaker. Three possible interpretations are offered: either XZ Tau C is\ntransiting XZ Tau A, which is broadly consistent with the periastron passage\nhypothesis, or the emission seen in 2004 was that of a transient, or XZ Tau C\ndoes not exist. A fourth interpretation, that XZ Tau C was ejected from the\nsystem, is dismissed due to the lack of angular momentum redistribution in the\norbits of XZ Tau A and XZ Tau B that would result from such an event. Our\nobservations are insufficient to distinguish between the remaining\npossibilities, at least not until we obtain further VLA observations at a\nsufficiently later time.

We find that the pairing interaction almost decouples\nbetween two subsets, one consists of the outer hole pocket and two electron\npockets, which are quasi-2D and are made largely out of dxy orbital, and the\nother consists of the two inner hole pockets, which are quasi-3D and are made\nmostly out of dxz and dyz orbitals. Furthermore, the bare inter-pocket and\nintra-pocket interactions within each subset are nearly equal. In this\nsituation, small changes in the intra-pocket and inter-pocket interactions due\nto renormalizations by high-energy fermions give rise to a variety of different\ngap structures. We find four different configurations of the s-wave gap\nimmediately below Tc: the one in which superconducting gap changes sign between\ntwo inner hole pockets and between the outer hole pocket and two electron\npockets, the one in which the gap changes sign between two electron pockets and\nthree hole pockets, the one in which the gap on the outer hole pocket differs\nin sign from the gaps on the other four pockets, and the one in which the gaps\non two inner hole pockets have one sign, and the gaps on the outer hole pockets\nand on electron pockets have different sign. Different s-wave gap\nconfigurations emerge depending on whether the renormalized interactions\nincrease attraction within each subset or increase the coupling between\nparticular components of the two subsets.

The hybridization number of a phylogenetic network is\nthe sum of all indegrees minus the number of nodes plus one. The Hybridization\nNumber problem takes as input a collection of phylogenetic trees and asks to\nconstruct a phylogenetic network that contains an embedding of each of the\ninput trees and has a smallest possible hybridization number. We present an\nalgorithm for the Hybridization Number problem on three binary trees on $n$\nleaves, which runs in time $O(c^k poly(n))$, with $k$ the hybridization number\nof an optimal network and $c$ a constant. For two trees, an algorithm with\nrunning time $O(3.18^k n)$ was proposed before whereas an algorithm with\nrunning time $O(c^k poly(n))$ had prior to this article remained elusive for\nmore than two trees. The algorithm for two trees uses the close connection to\nacyclic agreement forests to achieve a linear exponent in the running time,\nwhile previous algorithms for more than two trees (explicitly or implicitly)\nrelied on a brute force search through all possible underlying network\ntopologies, leading to running times that are not $O(c^k poly(n))$ for any $c$.\nThe connection to acyclic agreement forests is much weaker for more than two\ntrees, so even given the right agreement forest, reconstructing the network\nposes major challenges. We prove novel structural results that allow us to\nreconstruct a network without having to guess the underlying topology. Our\ntechniques generalize to more than three input trees with the exception of one\nkey lemma that maps nodes in the network to tree nodes and, thus, minimizes the\namount of guessing involved in constructing the network.

This light sensor has been\nused previously in the Knuth Cyberphysics Laboratory on a robotic arm that\nperforms its own experiments to locate a white circle in a dark field (Knuth et\nal., 2007). To use the light sensor to learn about its surroundings, the\nrobot's inference software must be able to model and predict the light sensor's\nresponse to a hypothesized stimulus. Previous models of the light sensor\ntreated it as a point sensor and ignored its spatial characteristics. Here we\npropose a parametric approach where the SSF is described by a mixture of\nGaussians (MOG). By performing controlled calibration experiments with known\nstimulus inputs, we used nested sampling to estimate the SSF of the light\nsensor using an MOG model with the number of Gaussians ranging from one to\nfive. By comparing the evidence computed for each MOG model, we found that one\nGaussian is sufficient to describe the SSF to the accuracy we require. Future\nwork will involve incorporating this more accurate SSF into the Bayesian\nmachine learning software for the robotic system and studying how this detailed\ninformation about the properties of the light sensor will improve robot's\nability to learn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2014 14:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-11"}

In order to\nstudy such phenomena, several nonlinear constitutive models were proposed and\nwere generally implemented for 1D soil columns. However, one of the main\ndifficulties of complex rheologies is the large number of parameters needed to\ndescribe the model. In this sense, the multi-surface cyclic plasticity\napproach, developed by Iwan in 1967 but linked to Prandtl or Preisach\ntheoretical work, is an interesting choice: the only data needed is the modulus\nreduction curve. Past studies have generally implemented such models for\none-directional shear wave propagation in a \"1D\" soil column considering one\nmotion component only (\"1C\"). Conversely, this work aims at studying strong\nmotion amplification by considering seismic wave propagation in a \"1D\" soil\ncolumn accounting for the influence of the 3D loading path on the nonlinear\nbehavior of each soil layer. In the \"1D-3C\" approach, the three components (3C)\nof the outcrop motion are simultaneously propagated into a horizontally layered\nsoil for which a three-dimensional constitutive relation is used (Finite\nElement Method).
