First, we quantify the distinguishability of any\ngiven pair of quantum states with measurement devices lacking microscopic\naccuracy, i.e. measurements suffering from limited resolution or limited\nsensitivity. Next, we quantify the required stability that have to be fulfilled\nby any measurement setup able to distinguish their superposition from a mere\nmixture.

Standard practice for Phase II\nremains to treat $p$ as a fixed, unknown parameter and to use Simon's 2-stage\ndesign with all patients dosed at $\\widehat{\\eta}$. We propose a Phase I-II\ndesign that addresses the uncertainty in the estimate $p=p(\\widehat{\\eta})$ in\n$H_0$ by using sequential generalized likelihood theory.

Efficient group\nsequential testing is used in Phase II that allows for early stopping to show\ntreatment effect or futility.

The groupoid is constructed from the\nsemantics of the theory (models and isomorphisms) and topologized using a\nStone-type construction. The sheaf of categories can be regarded as a logical\ntheory varying over the spectrum, and its global sections recover the theory up\nto semantic equivalence. These affine pieces can be glued together to give more\ngeneral logical schemes and these are studied using methods from algebraic\ngeometry. The final chapter also presents some connections between schemes and\nother areas of logic such as model theory, type theory and topos theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 18:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-12"}

Second, a region that is\nfilamentary only in projection and is in fact made of spatially distinct\nfeatures can displays these same velocity characteristics. The fact that these\ndisjoint structures can masquerade as coherent filaments in both projection and\nvelocity diagnostics highlights the need to continue developing sophisticated\nfilamentary analysis techniques for star formation observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 20:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-12"}

In a DNS the computational mesh resolves\nall physical gradients of the flow and the relative effect of numerical\ndissipation is small. In LES, unresolved scales are present and numerical\ndissipation can have a large impact on the flow, depending on the computational\nmesh. A suite of simulations explores the space between these two extremes by\nstudying the effects of grid resolution, Reynolds number and numerical method\non the mixing process. Results from a DNS are shown using two different codes,\nwhich use a high- and low-order numerical method and show convergence in the\ntemporal and spectral dependent quantities associated with mixing. Data from a\ncoarse LES are also presented and include a grid convergence study. A model for\nan effective viscosity is proposed which allows for an a posteriori analysis of\nthe simulation data that is agnostic to the LES model, numerics and the\nphysical Reynolds number of the simulation.

KDC represents a class of methods that includes distance\ncovariance (DC) and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), which are\nnonparametric tests of independence. We show the equivalence between the score\ntest of KMR and the KDC statistic under certain conditions. This result leads\nto a novel generalization of the KDC test that incorporates the covariates. Our\ncontributions are three-fold: (1) establishing the equivalence between KMR and\nKDC; (2) showing that the principles of kernel machine regression can be\napplied to the interpretation of KDC; (3) the development of a broader class of\nKDC statistics, that the members are the quantities of different kernels. We\ndemonstrate the proposals using simulation studies. Data from the Alzheimer's\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is used to explore the association\nbetween the genetic variants on gene \\emph{FLJ16124} and phenotypes represented\nin 3D structural brain MR images adjusting for age and gender. The results\nsuggest that SNPs of \\emph{FLJ16124} exhibit strong pairwise interaction\neffects that are correlated to the changes of brain region volumes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 21:52:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 00:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-03"}

Apart from\nthe information loss during quantization, another cause is that the SIFT\nfeature only describes the local gradient distribution. To address this\nproblem, this paper proposes a coupled Multi-Index (c-MI) framework to perform\nfeature fusion at indexing level. Basically, complementary features are coupled\ninto a multi-dimensional inverted index. Each dimension of c-MI corresponds to\none kind of feature, and the retrieval process votes for images similar in both\nSIFT and other feature spaces. Specifically, we exploit the fusion of local\ncolor feature into c-MI. While the precision of visual match is greatly\nenhanced, we adopt Multiple Assignment to improve recall. The joint cooperation\nof SIFT and color features significantly reduces the impact of false positive\nmatches.\n  Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that c-MI\nimproves the retrieval accuracy significantly, while consuming only half of the\nquery time compared to the baseline.

By their very nature, gossip algorithms\ntend to be distributed and fault tolerant. If done right, they can also be fast\nand message-efficient. A common model for gossip communication is the random\nphone call model, in which in each synchronous round each node can PUSH or PULL\ninformation to or from a random other node. For example, Karp et al. [FOCS\n2000] gave algorithms in this model that spread a message to all nodes in\n$\\Theta(\\log n)$ rounds while sending only $O(\\log \\log n)$ messages per node\non average.\n  Recently, Avin and Els\\\"asser [DISC 2013], studied the random phone call\nmodel with the natural and commonly used assumption of direct addressing.\nDirect addressing allows nodes to directly contact nodes whose ID (e.g., IP\naddress) was learned before. They show that in this setting, one can \"break the\n$\\log n$ barrier\" and achieve a gossip algorithm running in $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$\nrounds, albeit while using $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ messages per node.\n  We study the same model and give a simple gossip algorithm which spreads a\nmessage in only $O(\\log \\log n)$ rounds. We also prove a matching $\\Omega(\\log\n\\log n)$ lower bound which shows that this running time is best possible. In\nparticular we show that any gossip algorithm takes with high probability at\nleast $0.99 \\log \\log n$ rounds to terminate. Lastly, our algorithm can be\ntweaked to send only $O(1)$ messages per node on average with only $O(\\log n)$\nbits per message. Our algorithm therefore simultaneously achieves the optimal\nround-, message-, and bit-complexity for this setting. As all prior gossip\nalgorithms, our algorithm is also robust against failures. In particular, if in\nthe beginning an oblivious adversary fails any $F$ nodes our algorithm still,\nwith high probability, informs all but $o(F)$ surviving nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2014 00:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-13"}

In the following, we restate in the real\nspace the change of basis done by SMC. This change of basis reduces their model\nto two decoupled chains, each with its own Aubry- Andre potential. Each of the\nchains has its own critical point, where all states change from metallic to\ninsulat- ing, without any notion of a mobility edge. Since the two chains are\nnot interacting, their spectra may overlap such that localized states (from one\nchain) and delocal- ized states (from the other chain) coexist at the same en-\nergy. Consequently, the analysis of the density of states and the conductance\nalone is misleading, and that is due to the choice of the symmetric\nquasiperiodic potential.

Such\nstructures have previously been studied from a theoretical point of view, in\nlaboratory experiments, in linear numerical calculations and in some recent\nnumerical simulations. In the present paper, two-dimensional direct numerical\nsimulations of an inertial wave attractor are presented. In the linear regime,\nwe first recover the results of the linear calculations and asymptotic theory\nof Ogilvie (2005) who considered a prototypical problem involving the focusing\nof linear internal waves into a narrow beam centred on a wave attractor in a\nsteady state. The velocity profile of the beam and its scalings with the Ekman\nnumber, as well as the asymptotic value of the dissipation rate, are found to\nbe in agreement with the linear theory. We also find that, as the beam builds\nup around the wave attractor, the power input by the applied force reaches its\nlimiting value more rapidly than the dissipation rate, which saturates only\nwhen the beam has reached its final thickness. In the nonlinear regime, the\nbeam is strongly affected and becomes unstable to a subharmonic instability.\nThis instability transfers energy to secondary waves possessing shorter\nwavelengths and lower frequencies. The onset of the instability of a narrow\ninertial wave beam is investigated by means of a separate linear analysis and\nthe results, such as the onset of the instability, are found to be consistent\nwith the global simulations of the wave attractor.

The\ncomplexity of the system is expressed by several parameters of nonlinear\ndynamics, such as embedding dimension or false nearest neighbors, and the\nmethod of delay coordinates is applied to the time series. We also fit a damped\nrandom walk model, which accurately describes the variability of quasars, to\nthe solar 10Be data and investigate the corresponding power spectral\ndistribution.

Current chemical and genetic\ntechnologies used to manage plant diseases are highly vulnerable to pathogen\nevolution and are not sustainable. Pathogen evolution is facilitated by the\ngenetic uniformity underlying modern agroecosystems, suggesting that one path\nto sustainable disease control lies through increasing genetic diversity at the\nfield scale by using genetically diverse host mixtures. We investigate how host\nmixtures can improve disease control using a population dynamics model. We find\nthat when a population of crop plants is exposed to host-specialized pathogen\nspecies or strains, the overall disease severity is smaller in the mixture of\ntwo host varieties than in each of the corresponding pure stands. The disease\nseverity can be minimized over a range of mixing ratios. These findings may\nhelp in designing host mixtures that efficiently control diseases of crops. We\nthen generalize the model to describe host mixtures with many components. We\nfind that when pathogens exhibit host specialization, the overall disease\nseverity decreases with the number of components in the mixture. As the degree\nof specialization increases, the decrease in disease severity becomes larger.\nUsing these model outcomes, we propose ways to optimize the use of host\nmixtures to decrease disease in agroecosystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2014 11:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-13"}

Typical analyses of numerical methods for stochastic differential\nequations focus on properties such as the weak order which estimates the\nasymptotic (stepsize $h \\to 0$) convergence behavior of the error of finite\ntime averages. Recently it has been demonstrated, by study of Fokker-Planck\noperators, that a non-Markovian numerical method [Leimkuhler and Matthews,\n2013; Leimkuhler et al., 2013] generates approximations in the long time limit\nwith higher accuracy order (2nd order) than would be expected from its weak\nconvergence analysis (finite-time averages are 1st order accurate). In this\narticle we describe the transition from the transient to the steady-state\nregime of this numerical method by estimating the time-dependency of the\ncoefficients in an asymptotic expansion for the weak error, demonstrating that\nthe convergence to 2nd order is exponentially rapid in time. Moreover, we\nprovide numerical tests of the theory, including comparisons of the\nefficiencies of the Euler-Maruyama method, the popular 2nd order Heun method,\nand the non-Markovian method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2014 12:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

However, most social networks are\nevolving networks. It may be infeasible to recompute trusses from scratch from\ntime to time in order to find the up-to-date $k$-trusses in the evolving\nnetworks. In this paper, we discuss how to maintain trusses in a graph with\ndynamic updates. We first discuss a set of properties on maintaining trusses,\nthen propose algorithms on maintaining trusses on edge deletions and\ninsertions, finally, we discuss truss index maintenance. We test the proposed\ntechniques on real datasets. The experiment results show the promise of our\nwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2014 12:57:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-13"}

The most classical way of\naddressing the spherical location problem H_0:theta=theta_0, with theta_0 a\nfixed location, is the so-called Watson test, which is based on the sample mean\nof the observations. This test enjoys many desirable properties, but its\nimplementation requires the sample size n to be large compared to the dimension\np. This is a severe limitation, since more and more problems nowadays involve\nhigh-dimensional directional data (e.g., in genetics or text mining).

The underlying physics lies in the fact that a moving electron bunch\nwith rather low electron energy ($\\sim$1 keV) can efficiently excite graphene\nplasmons (GPs) of THz frequencies with a strong confinement of near-fields. GPs\ncan be further scattered into free space by the grating for those satisfying\nthe phase matching condition. The radiation patterns can be controlled by\nvarying the velocity of the moving electrons. Importantly, the radiation\nfrequencies can be tuned by varying the Fermi level of the graphene layer,\noffering tunable THz radiations that can cover a wide frequency range.

Indeed, migration of small planets is known to be too fast inwards in\nlocally isothermal conditions. However, thermal effects could reverse its\ndirection, potentially saving planets in the inner, optically thick parts of\nthe protoplanetary disc. This effect has been seen for masses larger than 5\nEarth masses, but the minimum mass for this to happen has never been probed\nnumerically, although it is of crucial importance for planet formation\nscenarios. We have extended the hydro-dynamical code FARGO to 3D, with thermal\ndiffusion. With this code, we perform simulations of embedded planets down to 2\nEarth masses. For a set of discs parameters for which outward migration has\nbeen shown in the range of $[5, 35]$ Earth masses, we find that the transition\nto inward migration occurs for masses in the range $[3, 5]$ Earth masses. The\ntransition appears to be due to an unexpected phenomenon: the formation of an\nasymmetric cold and dense finger of gas driven by circulation and libration\nstreamlines. We recover this phenomenon in 2D simulations where we control the\ncooling effects of the gas through a simple modeling of the energy equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2014 14:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

When a\nsimulation output does not depend smoothly on its inputs, the error and\nconvergence rate of many approximation methods deteriorate substantially. This\npaper details a method for efficiently localizing discontinuities in the input\nparameter domain, so that the model output can be approximated as a piecewise\nsmooth function. The approach comprises an initialization phase, which uses\npolynomial annihilation to assign function values to different regions and thus\nseed an automated labeling procedure, followed by a refinement phase that\nadaptively updates a kernel support vector machine representation of the\nseparating surface via active learning. The overall approach avoids structured\ngrids and exploits any available simplicity in the geometry of the separating\nsurface, thus reducing the number of model evaluations required to localize the\ndiscontinuity. The method is illustrated on examples of up to eleven\ndimensions, including algebraic models and ODE/PDE systems, and demonstrates\nimproved scaling and efficiency over other discontinuity localization\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2014 15:16:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Aug 2014 18:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-05"}

Named CAMELOT for Complex Amplitude\nMEasurement by a Likelihood Optimization Tool, it relies on the acquisition and\nprocessing of few images of the beam section taken along the optical path. The\ncomplex amplitude of the beam is retrieved from the images by the minimization\nof a Maximum a Posteriori error metric between the images and a model of the\nbeam propagation.

Writing the equations of motion for the\nexciton creation/annihilation operators, we are able to describe the exciton\ndynamics, even in the regime when the reorganization energy is of the order of\nthe intra-system couplings. In particular, we obtain the well-known quantum\noscillations of the site populations. We determine the exciton transfer\nefficiency in the presence of a quenching field and protein environment. While\nthe majority of the protein vibronic modes are treated as a heat bath, we\naddress the situation when specific modes are strongly coupled to excitons and\nexamine the effects of these modes on the quantum oscillations and the energy\ntransfer efficiency. We find that, for the vibronic frequencies below 16 meV,\nthe exciton transfer is drastically suppressed. We attribute this effect to the\nformation of \"polaronic states\" where the exciton is transferred back and forth\nbetween the two pigments with the absorption/emission of the vibronic quanta,\ninstead of proceeding to the reaction center. The same effect suppresses the\nquantum beating at the vibronic frequency of 25 meV. We also show that the\nefficiency of the energy transfer can be enhanced when the vibronic mode\nstrongly couples to the third pigment only, instead of coupling to the entire\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 23:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}
