However, for problems\nsuch as X-ray computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction and large-scale\nsparse regression with \"big data\", where there is no efficient way to solve the\ninner least-squares problem, the AL method can be slow due to the inevitable\niterative inner updates. In this paper, we focus on solving regularized\n(weighted) least-squares problems using a linearized variant of the AL method\nthat replaces the quadratic AL penalty term in the scaled augmented Lagrangian\nwith its separable quadratic surrogate (SQS) function, thus leading to a much\nsimpler ordered-subsets (OS) accelerable splitting-based algorithm, OS-LALM,\nfor X-ray CT image reconstruction. To further accelerate the proposed\nalgorithm, we use a second-order recursive system analysis to design a\ndeterministic downward continuation approach that avoids tedious parameter\ntuning and provides fast convergence. Experimental results show that the\nproposed algorithm significantly accelerates the \"convergence\" of X-ray CT\nimage reconstruction with negligible overhead and greatly reduces the OS\nartifacts in the reconstructed image when using many subsets for OS\nacceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 16:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-30"}

The resolution limit is known to prevent some\ncommunity detection algorithms from accurately identifying the modular\nstructure of a network. In fact, any global objective function for measuring\nthe quality of a two-level assignment of nodes into modules must have some sort\nof resolution limit or an external resolution parameter. However, it is yet\nunknown how the resolution limit affects the so-called map equation, which is\nknown to be an efficient objective function for community detection. We derive\nan analytical estimate and conclude that the resolution limit of the map\nequation is set by the total number of links between modules instead of the\ntotal number of links in the full network as for modularity. This mechanism\nmakes the resolution limit much less restrictive for the map equation than for\nmodularity, and in practice orders of magnitudes smaller. Furthermore, we argue\nthat the effect of the resolution limit often results from shoehorning\nmulti-level modular structures into two-level descriptions.

In this paper, we propose an incremental\nmajorization-minimization scheme for minimizing a large sum of continuous\nfunctions, a problem of utmost importance in machine learning. We present\nconvergence guarantees for non-convex and convex optimization when the upper\nbounds approximate the objective up to a smooth error; we call such upper\nbounds \"first-order surrogate functions\". More precisely, we study asymptotic\nstationary point guarantees for non-convex problems, and for convex ones, we\nprovide convergence rates for the expected objective function value. We apply\nour scheme to composite optimization and obtain a new incremental proximal\ngradient algorithm with linear convergence rate for strongly convex functions.\nIn our experiments, we show that our method is competitive with the state of\nthe art for solving machine learning problems such as logistic regression when\nthe number of training samples is large enough, and we demonstrate its\nusefulness for sparse estimation with non-convex penalties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 17:50:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 19:39:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 1 Feb 2015 07:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-03"}

Firstly, this allows us to\nderive robust model-independent phenomenological features and, conversely, to\nidentify the peculiarities of different explicit realizations. Secondly, limits\non cross-section times BR can be converted into bounds on a few relevant\nparameters in a fully analytic way, allowing for an interpretation in any given\nexplicit model. Based on the available 8 TeV LHC analyses, we derive current\nlimits and interpret them for vector triplets arising in weakly coupled (gauge)\nand strongly coupled (composite) extensions of the SM.

We find that gas expulsion and the associated dark matter (DM) expansion\ninduced by supernova-driven winds are important for haloes with masses M200 <\n10^13 Msun, lowering their masses by up to 20% relative to a DM-only model. AGN\nfeedback, which is required to prevent overcooling, has a significant impact on\nhalo masses all the way up to cluster scales (M200 ~ 10^15 Msun).

Our aim is a comprehensive\nstudy of timing behavior across all spectral states, including the elusive\ntransitions and extreme hard and soft states. We discuss the dependence of the\ntiming properties on spectral shape and photon energy, and study correlations\nbetween Fourier-frequency dependent coherence and time lags with features in\nthe power spectra. Our main results are: (a) The fractional rms in the\n0.125-256 Hz range in different spectral states shows complex behavior that\ndepends on the energy range considered. It reaches its maximum not in the hard\nstate, but in the soft state in the Comptonized tail above 10 keV. (b) The\nshape of power spectra in hard and intermediate states and the normalization in\nthe soft state are strongly energy dependent in the 2.1-15 keV range. This\nemphasizes the need for an energy-dependent treatment of power spectra and a\ncareful consideration of energy- and mass-scaling when comparing the\nvariability of different source types, e.g., black hole binaries and AGN. PSDs\nduring extremely hard and extremely soft states can be easily confused for\nenergies above ~5 keV in the 0.125-256 Hz range. (c) The coherence between\nenergy bands drops during transitions from the intermediate into the soft state\nbut recovers in the soft state. (d) The time lag spectra in soft and\nintermediate states show distinct features at frequencies related to the\nfrequencies of the main variability components seen in the power spectra and\nshow the same shift to higher frequencies as the source softens. [...abridged]\nIn particular, we discuss how the timing properties of Cyg X-1 can be used to\nassess the evolution of variability with spectral shape in other black hole\nbinaries.

In some cases, the\nfeatures can be grouped together so that entire subsets of features can be\nselected or not selected. In many applications, however, this can be too\nrestrictive. In this paper, we are interested in a less restrictive form of\nstructured sparse feature selection: we assume that while features can be\ngrouped according to some notion of similarity, not all features in a group\nneed be selected for the task at hand. When the groups are comprised of\ndisjoint sets of features, this is sometimes referred to as the \"sparse group\"\nlasso, and it allows for working with a richer class of models than traditional\ngroup lasso methods. Our framework generalizes conventional sparse group lasso\nfurther by allowing for overlapping groups, an additional flexiblity needed in\nmany applications and one that presents further challenges. The main\ncontribution of this paper is a new procedure called Sparse Overlapping Group\n(SOG) lasso, a convex optimization program that automatically selects similar\nfeatures for classification in high dimensions. We establish model selection\nerror bounds for SOGlasso classification problems under a fairly general\nsetting. In particular, the error bounds are the first such results for\nclassification using the sparse group lasso. Furthermore, the general SOGlasso\nbound specializes to results for the lasso and the group lasso, some known and\nsome new. The SOGlasso is motivated by multi-subject fMRI studies in which\nfunctional activity is classified using brain voxels as features, source\nlocalization problems in Magnetoencephalography (MEG), and analyzing gene\nactivation patterns in microarray data analysis. Experiments with real and\nsynthetic data demonstrate the advantages of SOGlasso compared to the lasso and\ngroup lasso.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 22:08:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 16:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

However, most epidemic models assume that the spreading process\ntakes place on a single level (be it a single population, a meta-population\nsystem or a network of contacts). In particular, interdependent contagion\nphenomena can only be addressed if we go beyond the scheme one pathogen-one\nnetwork. In this paper, we propose a framework that allows describing the\nspreading dynamics of two concurrent diseases. Specifically, we characterize\nanalytically the epidemic thresholds of the two diseases for different\nscenarios and also compute the temporal evolution characterizing the unfolding\ndynamics. Results show that there are regions of the parameter space in which\nthe onset of a disease's outbreak is conditioned to the prevalence levels of\nthe other disease. Moreover, we show, for the SIS scheme, that under certain\ncircumstances, finite and not vanishing epidemic thresholds are found even at\nthe thermodynamic limit for scale-free networks. For the SIR scenario, the\nphenomenology is richer and additional interdependencies show up. We also find\nthat the secondary thresholds for the SIS and SIR models are different, which\nresults directly from the interaction between both diseases. Our work thus\nsolve an important problem and pave the way towards a more comprehensive\ndescription of the dynamics of interacting diseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 22:53:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 17:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-15"}

When such competitions are driven by\nexternalities such as cumulative advantage (CA), the rich-get-richer effect,\nlittle is known with respect to fundamental properties such as their duration\nand intensity. In this work we provide a mathematical understanding of how CA\nexacerbates the role of luck in detriment of skill in simple and well-studied\ncompetition models.

In this work, we focus on unsupervised ranking from\nmulti-attribute data which is also common in evaluation tasks. To overcome the\nchallenge, we propose five essential meta-rules for the design and assessment\nof unsupervised ranking approaches: scale and translation invariance, strict\nmonotonicity, linear/nonlinear capacities, smoothness, and explicitness of\nparameter size. These meta-rules are regarded as high level knowledge for\nunsupervised ranking tasks. Inspired by the works in [8] and [14], we propose a\nranking principal curve (RPC) model, which learns a one-dimensional manifold\nfunction to perform unsupervised ranking tasks on multi-attribute observations.\nFurthermore, the RPC is modeled to be a cubic B\\'ezier curve with control\npoints restricted in the interior of a hypercube, thereby complying with all\nthe five meta-rules to infer a reasonable ranking list. With control points as\nthe model parameters, one is able to understand the learned manifold and to\ninterpret the ranking list semantically. Numerical experiments of the presented\nRPC model are conducted on two open datasets of different ranking applications.\nIn comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches, the new model is able to\nshow more reasonable ranking lists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 01:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-20"}

At the level of the 10d supergravity solution, anti-branes in flux\nbackgrounds with opposite charge are known to source singular terms in the\nenergy densities of the bulk fluxes, which led to a debate on the consistency\nof such constructions in string theory. A straightforward yet non-trivial check\nof the singular solution is to verify that its dimensional reduction in the\nlarge-volume limit reproduces the 4d low-energy dynamics expected from known\nresults where the anti-branes are treated as a probe. Taking into account the\nanti-brane backreaction in the effective scalar potential, we find that both\nthe volume scaling and the coefficient of the anti-brane uplift term are in\nexact agreement with the probe potential if the singular fluxes satisfy a\ncertain near-brane boundary condition.

We consider, here, the question of how the wiring\ndiagram of neurons imposes constraints on what neural circuits can compute,\nwhen we cannot assume detailed information on the physiological response\nproperties of the neurons. We call such constraints -- that arise by virtue of\nthe connectome -- connectomic constraints on computation. For feedforward\nnetworks equipped with neurons that obey a deterministic spiking neuron model\nwhich satisfies a small number of properties, we ask if just by knowing the\narchitecture of a network, we can rule out computations that it could be doing,\nno matter what response properties each of its neurons may have. We show\nresults of this form, for certain classes of network architectures. On the\nother hand, we also prove that with the limited set of properties assumed for\nour model neurons, there are fundamental limits to the constraints imposed by\nnetwork structure. Thus, our theory suggests that while connectomic constraints\nmight restrict the computational ability of certain classes of network\narchitectures, we may require more elaborate information on the properties of\nneurons in the network, before we can discern such results for other classes of\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 08:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-03"}

We demonstrate that the\nquantity which characterizes the dynamics with non-uniform $\\alpha(r)$ is not\nthe displacement of the particle $\\Delta r=r-r^0$ (where $r^0$ is the initial\nposition), but rather $\\Delta A(r)=A(r)-A(r^0)$, where $A(r)$ is the primitive\nfunction of $\\alpha(r)$. We derive expressions relating the mean and variance\nof $\\Delta A$ to $f$, $T$, and the duration of the dynamics $\\Delta t$. For a\nconstant friction coefficient $\\alpha(r)=\\alpha$, these expressions reduce to\nthe well known forms of the force-drift and fluctuation-dissipation relations.\nWe introduce a very accurate method for Langevin dynamics simulations in\nsystems with spatially varying $\\alpha(r)$, and use the method to validate the\nnewly derived expressions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 09:22:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 21:19:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Jun 2014 11:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

A randomized control architecture is proposed, motivated by the need for\ndecentralized decision making, and the need to avoid synchronization that can\nlead to large and detrimental spikes in demand. An aggregate model for a large\nnumber of loads is then developed by examining the mean field limit.

Recent statistical\nanalyses based on conditional averaging indicate that near these theoretical\nconstraints the solar wind protons have typically enhanced temperatures and a\nweaker collisionality. Here we carefully analyze the solar wind data and show\nthat these results are a consequence of superposition of multiple correlations\nin the solar wind, namely, they mostly result from the correlation between the\nproton temperature and the solar wind velocity and from the superimposed\nanti-correlation between the proton temperature anisotropy and the proton\nparallel beta in the fast solar wind. Colder and more collisional data are\ndistributed around temperature isotropy whereas hotter and less collisional\ndata have a wider range of the temperature anisotropy anti-correlated with the\nproton parallel beta with signatures of constraints owing to the\ntemperature-anisotropy driven instabilities. However, most of the hot and\nweakly collisional data, including the hottest and least collisional ones, lies\nfar from the marginal stability regions.

Our study, part of the Herschel M33 Extended Survey (HERM33ES) open\ntime key program, aims at addressing this issue by analyzing the infrared\nemission from the nearby spiral galaxy M33 at the high spatial scale of 75 pc.\nCombining data from the Herschel Space Observatory and the Spitzer Space\nTelescope we find that the 8 {\\mu}m emission is better correlated with the 250\n{\\mu}m emission, which traces cold interstellar gas, than with the 24 {\\mu}m\nemission.

This failure is mediated by the propagation along the interface of\nvarious types of rupture fronts, covering a wide range of velocities. Among\nthem are so-called slow fronts, which are recently discovered fronts much\nslower than the materials' sound speeds. Despite intense modelling activity,\nthe mechanisms underlying slow fronts remain elusive. Here, we introduce a\nmulti-scale model capable of reproducing both the transition from fast to slow\nfronts in a single rupture event and the short-time slip dynamics observed in\nrecent experiments. We identify slow slip immediately following the arrest of a\nfast front as a phenomenon sufficient for the front to propagate further at a\nmuch slower pace. Whether slow fronts are actually observed is controlled both\nby the interfacial stresses and by the width of the local distribution of\nforces among micro-junctions. Our results show that slow fronts are\nqualitatively different from faster fronts. Since the transition from fast to\nslow fronts is potentially as generic as slow slip, we anticipate that it might\noccur in the wide range of systems in which slow slip has been reported,\nincluding seismic faults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 15:33:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jun 2014 14:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-23"}

The simulations show that, even\nin the absense of twist, the magnetic flux is able the rise through the upper\n$15.5$ Mm of the convection zone and emerge into the photosphere to form spots.\nWe find that spot formation is sensitive to the persistence of upflows at the\nbottom boundary footpoints, i.e. a continuing upflow would prevent spot\nformation. In addition, the presence of a torus-aligned flow (such flow into\nthe retrograde direction is expected from angular momentum conservation during\nthe rise of flux ropes through the convection zone) leads to a significant\nasymmetry between the pair of spots, with the spot corresponding to the leading\nspot on the Sun being more axisymmetric and coherent, but also forming with a\ndelay relative to the following spot. The spot formation phase transitions\ndirectly into a decay phase. Subsurface flows fragment the magnetic field and\nlead to intrusions of almost field free plasma underneath the photosphere. When\nsuch intrusions reach photospheric layers, the spot fragments. The time scale\nfor spot decay is comparable to the longest convective time scales present in\nthe simulation domain. We find that the dispersal of flux from a simulated spot\nin the first two days of the decay phase is consistent with self-similar decay\nby turbulent diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 15:38:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}
