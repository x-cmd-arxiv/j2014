By computing new effective collision\nstrengths for all these systems and A-values when necessary (e.g. S II), and by\ncomparing with previous collisional and radiative datasets, we have been able\nto obtain realistic estimates of the electron-temperature dispersion caused by\nthe atomic data, which in most cases are not larger than $\\sim 10$%. If the\nuncertainties due to both observation and atomic data are then taken into\naccount, it is plausible to determine for some nebulae a representative average\ntemperature while in others there are at least two plasma excitation regions.\nFor the latter, it is found that the diagnostic temperature differences in the\nhigh-excitation region, e.g. $T_e$(O III), $T_e$(S III), and $T_e$(Ar III),\ncannot be conciliated by invoking $\\kappa$ distributions. For the low\nexcitation region, it is possible in some, but not all, cases to arrive at a\ncommon, lower temperature for [N II], [O II], and [S II] with $\\kappa\\approx\n10$, which would then lead to significant abundance enhancements for these\nions. An analytic formula is proposed to generate accurate $\\kappa$-averaged\nexcitation rate coefficients (better than 10% for $\\kappa \\geq 5$) from\ntemperature tabulations of the Maxwell-Boltzmann effective collision strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 16:07:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2014 13:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

This imitating behavior might lead to the\nstrategic decision of adopting a public behavior that differs from what the\nagent believes is the right one and this can subvert the behavior of the\npopulation as a whole.\n  In this paper, we consider the case in which agents express preferences over\ntwo alternatives and model social pressure with the majority dynamics: at each\nstep an agent is selected and its preference is replaced by the majority of the\npreferences of her neighbors. In case of a tie, the agent does not change her\ncurrent preference. A profile of the agents' preferences is stable if the\npreference of each agent coincides with the preference of at least half of the\nneighbors (thus, the system is in equilibrium).\n  We ask whether there are network topologies that are robust to social\npressure. That is, we ask if there are graphs in which the majority of\npreferences in an initial profile always coincides with the majority of the\npreference in all stable profiles reachable from that profile. We completely\ncharacterize the graphs with this robustness property by showing that this is\npossible only if the graph has no edge or is a clique or very close to a\nclique. In other words, except for this handful of graphs, every graph admits\nat least one initial profile of preferences in which the majority dynamics can\nsubvert the initial majority. We also show that deciding whether a graph admits\na minority that becomes majority is NP-hard when the minority size is at most\n1/4-th of the social network size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 16:35:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 08:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2015 10:30:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2015 07:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-02"}

We answer this question for the simplest class of\ntopological phases, namely those with abelian braiding statistics.\nSpecifically, we find that an abelian topological phase can be realized by a\nstring-net model if and only if (i) it has a vanishing thermal Hall conductance\nand (ii) it has at least one Lagrangian subgroup --- a subset of quasiparticles\nwith particular topological properties. Equivalently, we find that an abelian\ntopological phase is realizable if and only if it supports a gapped edge. We\nconjecture that the latter criterion generalizes to the non-abelian case. We\nestablish these results by systematically constructing all possible abelian\nstring-net models and analyzing the quasiparticle braiding statistics in each\nmodel. We show that the low energy effective field theories for these models\nare multicomponent U(1) Chern-Simons theories, and we derive the K-matrix\ndescription of each model. An additional feature of this work is that the\nmodels we construct are more general than the original string-net models, due\nto several new ingredients. First, we introduce two new objects $\\gamma,\n\\alpha$ into the construction which are related to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and\n$\\mathbb{Z}_3$ Frobenius-Schur indicators. Second, we do not assume parity\ninvariance. As a result, we can realize topological phases that were not\naccessible to the original construction, including phases that break\ntime-reversal and parity symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 17:45:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-23"}

A general framework for HMC based on the use of\ngraphical processing units (GPUs) is shown to greatly reduce the computing time\nneeded for Bayesian inference. The most expensive computational tasks in HMC\nare the evaluation of the posterior kernel and computing its gradient with\nrespect to the parameters of interest. One of primary goals of this article to\nshow that by expressing each of these tasks in terms of simple matrix or\nelement-wise operations and maintaining persistent objects in GPU memory, the\ncomputational time can be drastically reduced. By using GPU objects to perform\nthe entire HMC simulation, most of the latency penalties associated with\ntransferring data from main to GPU memory can be avoided.

However, a limitation of HMC methods is\nthe required gradient computation for simulation of the Hamiltonian dynamical\nsystem-such computation is infeasible in problems involving a large sample size\nor streaming data. Instead, we must rely on a noisy gradient estimate computed\nfrom a subset of the data. In this paper, we explore the properties of such a\nstochastic gradient HMC approach. Surprisingly, the natural implementation of\nthe stochastic approximation can be arbitrarily bad. To address this problem we\nintroduce a variant that uses second-order Langevin dynamics with a friction\nterm that counteracts the effects of the noisy gradient, maintaining the\ndesired target distribution as the invariant distribution.

Energy conservation\nhas become a major concern, so revisiting traditional scheduling problems to\ntake into account the energy consumption has been part of the agenda of the\nscheduling community for the past few years.\n  We consider the energy minimizing speed scaling problem introduced by Yao et\nal. where we wish to schedule a set of jobs, each with a release date, deadline\nand work volume, on a set of identical processors. The processors may change\nspeed as a function of time and the energy they consume is the $\\alpha$th power\nof its speed.

The existence of magnetically driven turbulence in these discs has\nbeen a central question since the discovery of the magnetorotational\ninstability. Early models considered Ohmic diffusion only and led to a scenario\nof layered accretion, in which a magnetically \"dead\" zone in the disc midplane\nis embedded within magnetically \"active\" surface layers at distances ~1-10 au\nfrom the central protostellar object. Recent work has suggested that a\ncombination of Ohmic dissipation and ambipolar diffusion can render both the\nmidplane and surface layers of the disc inactive and that torques due to\nmagnetically driven outflows are required to explain the observed accretion\nrates. We reassess this picture by performing three-dimensional numerical\nsimulations that include, for the first time, all three non-ideal MHD effects.\nWe find that the Hall effect can generically \"revive\" dead zones by producing a\ndominant azimuthal magnetic field and a large-scale Maxwell stress throughout\nthe midplane, provided the angular velocity and magnetic field satisfy Omega.B\n> 0. The attendant large magnetic pressure modifies the vertical density\nprofile and substantially increases the disc scale height beyond its\nhydrostatic value. Outflows are produced, but are not necessary to explain\naccretion rates <10^{-7} Msun/yr. The flow in the disc midplane is essentially\nlaminar, suggesting that dust sedimentation may be efficient.

Previous studies have\nshown that the presence of X-ray selected AGN in rich galaxy clusters is\nsuppressed. In the current study we investigate the occurrence of X-ray\nselected AGN in low and moderate X-ray luminosity galaxy clusters. Due to the\nwide contiguous XMM-LSS survey area we are able to extend the study to the\ncluster outskirts. We therefore determine the projected overdensity of X-ray\npoint-like sources out to 6r_{500} radius. To provide robust statistical\nresults we also use a stacking analysis of the cluster projected overdensities.\nWe investigate whether the observed X-ray overdensities are to be expected by\nestimating also the corresponding optical galaxy overdensities. We find a\npositive X-ray projected overdensity at the first radial bin, which is however\nof the same amplitude as that of optical galaxies. Therefore, no suppression of\nX-ray AGN activity with respect to the field is found, implying that the\nmechanisms responsible for the suppression are not so effective in lower\ndensity environments. After a drop to roughly the background level between 2\nand 3r_{500}, the X-ray overdensity exhibits a rise at larger radii,\nsignificantly larger than the corresponding optical overdensity. Finally, using\nredshift information of all optical counterparts, we derive the spatial\noverdensity profile of the clusters. We find that the agreement between X-ray\nand optical overdensities in the first radial bin is also suggested in the\n3-dimensional analysis. However, we argue that the X-ray overdensity \"bump\" at\nlarger radial distance is probably a result of flux boosting by gravitational\nlensing of background QSOs.

Few of these efforts have focused on evaluating the\nactual response of the bridge systems, especially beyond the elastic limit of\ntheir behavior, and correlating the impact of damage to the overall system\nbehavior. In practice, most of the in-service bridge superstructures behave\nelastically under the routine daily traffic; however, existing damage and\ndeteriorating conditions would significantly influence different aspects of the\nstructural performance including reserve capacity, resilience and remaining\nservice-life. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the response of\ncomposite steel girder bridges under the effect of subsurface delamination in\nthe reinforced concrete deck. Commercial finite element computer software,\nANSYS, was implemented to perform a nonlinear analysis on a representative\nsingle-span simply supported bridge superstructure. The system failure\ncharacteristics were captured in the numerical models by incorporating\ndifferent sources of material non-linearities including cracking/crushing in\nthe concrete and plasticity in steel components. Upon validation, non-linear\nbehavior of the system with both intact and degraded configurations was used to\nevaluate the impact of integrated damage mechanism on the overall system\nperformance. Reserve capacity of this bridge superstructure was also determined\nwith respect to the nominal element-level design capacity. As vision to the\nfuture path, this framework can be implemented to evaluate the performance of\nother in-service bridges degraded under the effect of different damage\nscenarios, thus providing a mechanism to determine a measure of capacity,\nresilience and remaining service-life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 23:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-19"}

We show that by incorporating the validity\nconstraints, the strengthened LP often provides much tighter upper bounds than\nthe previous methods with a little more computational effort, and the solution\nobtained often has a much smaller gap with the optimal solution.

Much of this work seeks to understand how the realized\nequilibrium of a game is influenced by uncertainty in the environment and the\ninformation available to players in the game. Lurking beneath this literature\nis a fundamental, yet largely unexplored, algorithmic question: how should a\n\"market maker\" who is privy to additional information, and equipped with a\nspecified objective, inform the players in the game? This is an informational\nanalogue of the mechanism design question, and views the information structure\nof a game as a mathematical object to be designed, rather than an exogenous\nvariable.\n  We initiate a complexity-theoretic examination of the design of optimal\ninformation structures in general Bayesian games, a task often referred to as\nsignaling. We focus on one of the simplest instantiations of the signaling\nquestion: Bayesian zero-sum games, and a principal who must choose an\ninformation structure maximizing the equilibrium payoff of one of the players.\nIn this setting, we show that optimal signaling is computationally intractable,\nand in some cases hard to approximate, assuming that it is hard to recover a\nplanted clique from an Erdos-Renyi random graph. This is despite the fact that\nequilibria in these games are computable in polynomial time, and therefore\nsuggests that the hardness of optimal signaling is a distinct phenomenon from\nthe hardness of equilibrium computation. Necessitated by the non-local nature\nof information structures, en-route to our results we prove an \"amplification\nlemma\" for the planted clique problem which may be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 00:43:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 05:41:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 18:27:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 20 Jul 2014 11:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-22"}

As is\nwell-known, the fractional objective function can be replaced by a parametric\nfamily of quadratic functions, which makes (P) highly related to, but more\ndifficult than a single quadratic programming problem subject to a similar\nconstraint set. The task is to find the optimal parameter $\\lambda^*$ and then\nlook for the optimal solution if $\\lambda^*$ is attained. Contrasted with the\nclassical Dinkelbach method that iterates over the parameter, we propose a\nsuitable constraint qualification under which a new version of the S-lemma with\nan equality can be proved so as to compute $\\lambda^*$ directly via an exact\nSDP relaxation. When the constraint set of (P) is degenerated to become an\none-sided inequality, the same SDP approach can be applied to solve (P) {\\it\nwithout any condition}. We observe that the difference between a two-sided\nproblem and an one-sided problem lies in the fact that the S-lemma with an\nequality does not have a natural Slater point to hold, which makes the former\nessentially more difficult than the latter. This work does not, either, assume\nthe existence of a positive-definite linear combination of the quadratic terms\n(also known as the dual Slater condition, or a positive-definite matrix\npencil), our result thus provides a novel extension to the so-called \"hard\ncase\" of the generalized trust region subproblem subject to the upper and the\nlower level set of a quadratic function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 01:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-19"}

Motivation for such\nstudies lies in coherent pulsed laser experiments that explore the\nisomerization dynamics. However, such biological processes take place naturally\nin the presence of incoherent light, which excites a non-evolving mixture of\nstationary states. Here the isomerization problem is considered from the latter\nviewpoint and applied to a standard two-state, two-mode linear vibronic\ncoupling model of retinal that explicitly includes a conical intersection\nbetween the ground and first excited electronic states. The calculated quantum\nyield at 500 nm agrees well with both the previous time-dependent calculations\nof Hahn and Stock (0.63) and with experiment ($0.65\\pm0.01$), as does its\nwavelength dependence. Significantly, the effects of environmental relaxation\non the quantum yield in this well-established model are found to be negligible.\nThe results make clear the connection of the photoisomerization quantum yield\nto properties of stationary eigenstates, providing alternate insights into\nconditions for yield optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 02:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-19"}

Moreover, the growing popularity of\nhighly interactive applications with stringent uplink (UL) requirements, e.g.\nnetwork gaming and real-time broadcasting by wireless users, means that the UL\ntransmission is becoming more crucial and requires special attention. Therefore\nin this paper, we propose a joint downlink (DL) and UL MU-AP association and\nbeamforming design to coordinate interference in the C-RAN for energy\nminimization, a problem which is shown to be NP hard.

In\nparticular, the chemo-dynamical distribution functions for low-mass stars\n(e.g., G- or K-type dwarfs) are precious tracers of the earliest stages of the\nMilky Way's formation, since their main-sequence lifetimes approach or exceed\nthe age of the universe. A basic tenet of essentially all previous analyses is\nthat the stellar metallicity, usually parametrized as [Fe/H], is conserved over\ntime for main-sequence stars (at least those that have not been polluted due to\nmass transfer from binary companions). If this holds true, any correlations\nbetween metallicity and kinematics for long-lived main-sequence stars of\ndifferent masses, effective temperatures, or spectral types must strictly be\nthe same, since they reflect the same mass-assembly and star-formation\nhistories. By analyzing a sample of nearby metal-poor halo and thick-disk stars\non the main sequence, taken from Data Release 8 of the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey, we find that the median metallicity of G-type dwarfs is systematically\nhigher (by about 0.2 dex) than that of K-type dwarfs having the same median\nrotational velocity about the Galactic center. If it can be confirmed, this\nfinding may invalidate the long-accepted assumption that the atmospheric\nmetallicities of long-lived stars are conserved over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 08:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Quantification of force and stress is therefore\nnecessary to analyze the mechanisms controlling tissue morphogenesis. Recently,\na mechanical measurement method based on force inference from cell shapes and\nconnectivity has been developed. It is non-invasive, and can provide space-time\nmaps of force and stress within an epithelial tissue, up to prefactors. We\npreviously performed a comparative study of three force-inference methods,\nwhich differ in their approach of treating indefiniteness in an inverse problem\nbetween cell shapes and forces. In the present study, to further validate and\ncompare the three force inference methods, we tested their robustness by\nmeasuring temporal fluctuation of estimated forces. Quantitative data of\ncell-level dynamics in a developing tissue suggests that variation of forces\nand stress will remain small within a short period of time ($\\sim$minutes).\nHere, we showed that cell-junction tensions and global stress inferred by the\nBayesian force inference method varied less with time than those inferred by\nthe method that estimates only tension. In contrast, the amplitude of temporal\nfluctuations of estimated cell pressures differs less between different\nmethods. Altogether, the present study strengthens the validity and robustness\nof the Bayesian force-inference method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 12:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-19"}

A larger total number of dipoles leads to a clusterization where\nthe dipolar chains move closer to each other. This implies a change in the\nlocal density and the emergence of two length scales, one for the cluster size\nand one for the inter-cluster distance along the helix. Starting from three\ndipoles per revolution, this implies a breaking of the initial periodicity to\nform a cluster of two chains close together and a third chain removed from the\ncluster. This is driven by the competition between in-chain and out-of-chain\ninteractions, or alternatively the side-by-side repulsion and the head-to-tail\nattraction in the system.

We introduce here a hierarchical Bayesian method to detect local\nadaptation that can deal with complex demographic histories. Our method can\nidentify selection occurring at different scales, as well as convergent\nadaptation in different regions.

These corrections cannot be obtained by Newtonian\nnumerical simulations, so it is important to accurately estimate the magnitude\nof these relativistic effects. Density fluctuations couple to produce a\nbackground of gravitational waves, which is larger than any primordial\nbackground. A similar interaction produces a much larger spectrum of vector\nmodes which represent the frame-dragging rotation of spacetime. These can\nchange the metric at the percent level in the concordance model at scales below\nthe equality scale. Vector modes modify the lensing of background galaxies by\nlarge-scale structure. This gives in principle the exciting possibility of\nmeasuring relativistic frame dragging effects on cosmological scales. The\neffects of the non-linear tensor and vector modes on the cosmic convergence are\ncomputed and compared to first-order lensing contributions from density\nfluctuations, Doppler lensing, and smaller Sachs-Wolfe effects. The lensing\nfrom gravitational waves is negligible so we concentrate on the vector modes.\nWe show the relative importance of this for future surveys such as Euclid and\nSKA. We find that these non-linear effects only marginally affect the overall\nweak lensing signal so they can safely be neglected in most analyses, though\nare still much larger than the linear Sachs-Wolfe terms.

Traditional SRL approaches rely on (finite) First-Order Logic (FOL)\nas a description language, and on MAX-SAT solvers to perform inference.

We give a general argument showing that the Zeno effect is suppressed\nin the presence of a decoherence mechanism which kills interference between\nhistories.

Goldstein and S. Osher, SIAM J. Imaging\nSci., 2 (2009), pp. 323-43] is a fast splitting-based algorithm that solves\nimage reconstruction problems with general l1, e.g., total-variation (TV) and\ncompressed sensing (CS), regularizations by introducing a single variable split\nto decouple the data-fitting term and the regularization term, yielding simple\nsubproblems that are separable (or partially separable) and easy to minimize.\nSeveral convergence proofs have been proposed, and these proofs either impose a\n\"full column rank\" assumption to the split or assume exact updates in all\nsubproblems. However, these assumptions are impractical in many applications\nsuch as the X-ray computed tomography (CT) image reconstructions, where the\ninner least-squares problem usually cannot be solved efficiently due to the\nhighly shift-variant Hessian. In this paper, we show that when the data-fitting\nterm is quadratic, the SB method is a convergent alternating direction method\nof multipliers (ADMM), and a straightforward convergence proof with inexact\nupdates is given using [J.

To have a concrete example,\nwe conduct a convergence rate analysis of the ADMM algorithm using two splits\nfor image restoration problems with quadratic data-fitting term and\nregularization term.
