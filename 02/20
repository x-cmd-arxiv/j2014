The Sun shows strong variability in its magnetic activity, from Grand\nminima to Grand maxima, but the nature of the variability is not fully\nunderstood, mostly because of the insufficient length of the directly observed\nsolar activity records and of uncertainties related to long-term\nreconstructions. Here we present a new adjustment-free reconstruction of solar\nactivity over three millennia and study its different modes. Methods. We\npresent a new adjustment-free, physical reconstruction of solar activity over\nthe past three millennia, using the latest verified carbon cycle, 14C\nproduction, and archeomagnetic field models. This great improvement allowed us\nto study different modes of solar activity at an unprecedented level of\ndetails. Results. The distribution of solar activity is clearly bi-modal,\nimplying the existence of distinct modes of activity. The main regular activity\nmode corresponds to moderate activity that varies in a relatively narrow band\nbetween sunspot numbers about 20 and 67. The existence of a separate Grand\nminimum mode with reduced solar activity, which cannot be explained by random\nfluctuations of the regular mode, is confirmed at a high confidence level. The\npossible existence of a separate Grand maximum mode is also suggested, but the\nstatistics is too low to reach a confident conclusion. Conclusions. The Sun is\nshown to operate in distinct modes - a main general mode, a Grand minimum mode\ncorresponding to an inactive Sun, and a possible Grand maximum mode\ncorresponding to an unusually active Sun. These results provide important\nconstraints for both dynamo models of Sun-like stars and investigations of\npossible solar influence on Earth's climate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 16:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-24"}

These models are readily amenable to a\nrelatively unambiguous physical interpretation in terms of slow twisting of a\ncoronal loop. They share similarities with other avalanche models, such as the\nclassical stick--slip self-organized critical model of earthquakes, in that\nthey are driven globally by a fully deterministic energy loading process. The\nmodel design leads to a systematic deficit of small scale avalanches. In some\nportions of model space, mid-size and large avalanching behavior is scale-free,\nbeing characterized by event size distributions that have the form of\npower-laws with index values, which, in some parameter regimes, compare\nfavorably to those inferred from solar EUV and X-ray flare data. For models\nusing conservative or near-conservative redistribution rules, a population of\nlarge, quasiperiodic avalanches can also appear. Although without direct\ncounterparts in the observational global statistics of flare energy release,\nthis latter behavior may be relevant to recurrent flaring in individual coronal\nloops.

We would like to\nabstract away this difficulty for the class of time-stamped categorical\nvariables (or events) by modeling them as a renewal process and inferring a\nprobability density over continuous, longitudinal, nonparametric intensity\nfunctions modulating that process. Several methods exist for inferring such a\ndensity over intensity functions, but either their constraints and assumptions\nprevent their use with our potentially bursty event streams, or their time\ncomplexity renders their use intractable on our long-duration observations of\nhigh-resolution events, or both. In this paper we present a new and efficient\nmethod for inferring a distribution over intensity functions that uses direct\nnumeric integration and smooth interpolation over Gaussian processes. We\ndemonstrate that our direct method is up to twice as accurate and two orders of\nmagnitude more efficient than the best existing method (thinning). Importantly,\nthe direct method can infer intensity functions over the full range of bursty\nto memoryless to regular events, which thinning and many other methods cannot.\nFinally, we apply the method to clinical event data and demonstrate the\nface-validity of the abstraction, which is now amenable to standard learning\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 17:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-20"}

This\nquestion is important not only for the efficiency and the security of\ninformation processing, but also for understanding how extremely unpredictable\nevents are possible in Nature. All current solutions require special structures\nin the initial source of randomness, or a certain independence relation among\ntwo or more sources. Both types of assumptions are impossible to test and\ndifficult to guarantee in practice. Here we show how this fundamental limit can\nbe circumvented by extractors that base security on the validity of physical\nlaws and extract randomness from untrusted quantum devices. In conjunction with\nthe recent work of Miller and Shi (arXiv:1402:0489), our physical randomness\nextractor uses just a single and general weak source, produces an arbitrarily\nlong and near-uniform output, with a close-to-optimal error, secure against\nall-powerful quantum adversaries, and tolerating a constant level of\nimplementation imprecision. The source necessarily needs to be unpredictable to\nthe devices, but otherwise can even be known to the adversary.\n  Our central technical contribution, the Equivalence Lemma, provides a general\nprinciple for proving composition security of untrusted-device protocols. It\nimplies that unbounded randomness expansion can be achieved simply by\ncross-feeding any two expansion protocols. In particular, such an unbounded\nexpansion can be made robust, which is known for the first time. Another\nsignificant implication is, it enables the secure randomness generation and key\ndistribution using public randomness, such as that broadcast by NIST's\nRandomness Beacon. Our protocol also provides a method for refuting local\nhidden variable theories under a weak assumption on the available randomness\nfor choosing the measurement settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 20:40:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 17:41:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 May 2015 22:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-18"}

We employ\naxisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations of remnant accretion\ndisks orbiting a HMNS of variable lifetime, and characterize the effect of this\ndelay to BH formation on the disk wind ejecta. When BH formation is relatively\nprompt (~ 100 ms), outflows from the disk are sufficiently neutron rich to form\nheavy r-process elements, resulting in ~ week-long emission with a spectral\npeak in the near-infrared (NIR), similar to that produced by the dynamical\nejecta. In contrast, delayed BH formation allows neutrinos from the HMNS to\nraise the electron fraction in the polar direction to values such that\npotentially Lanthanide-free outflows are generated. The lower opacity would\nproduce a brighter, bluer, and shorter-lived ~ day-long emission (a `blue\nbump') prior to the late NIR peak from the dynamical ejecta and equatorial\nwind. This new diagnostic of BH formation should be useful for events with a\nsignal to noise lower than that required for direct detection of gravitational\nwaveform signatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 May 2014 04:29:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Rather, an analysis that takes\nmorphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blue\nearly-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologies\nare transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly.\nIn contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks,\nand they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation rates\ndecline very slowly.

We interpret these results in terms\nof the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. We conclude that\nlate-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply of\ngas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustion\nof the remaining gas over several Gyr, driven by secular and/or environmental\nprocesses. In contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gas\nsupply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapid\nquenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disk to spheroid.\nThis gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger,\nwhich in most cases transforms galaxies from disk to elliptical morphology, and\nmergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly AGN\nfeedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 21:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In such a scenario, star formation\nappears globally delayed with respect to the LambdaCDM, in particular in\nlow-mass galaxies. The difficulty of obtaining a full agreement between model\nresults and observations is to be ascribed to our present poor understanding of\nbaryonic physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 21:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Quantum error correction provides this\nprotection, by distributing a logical state among many physical qubits via\nquantum entanglement. Superconductivity is an appealing platform, as it allows\nfor constructing large quantum circuits, and is compatible with\nmicrofabrication. For superconducting qubits the surface code is a natural\nchoice for error correction, as it uses only nearest-neighbour coupling and\nrapidly-cycled entangling gates. The gate fidelity requirements are modest: The\nper-step fidelity threshold is only about 99%. Here, we demonstrate a universal\nset of logic gates in a superconducting multi-qubit processor, achieving an\naverage single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.92% and a two-qubit gate fidelity up\nto 99.4%. This places Josephson quantum computing at the fault-tolerant\nthreshold for surface code error correction. Our quantum processor is a first\nstep towards the surface code, using five qubits arranged in a linear array\nwith nearest-neighbour coupling. As a further demonstration, we construct a\nfive-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state using the complete circuit\nand full set of gates. The results demonstrate that Josephson quantum computing\nis a high-fidelity technology, with a clear path to scaling up to large-scale,\nfault-tolerant quantum circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 23:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-24"}

The geometry of small angle X-ray\nscattering is straightforward, namely, the scattered photons travel longer\npaths and thus arrive later than the unscattered ones; thus the delay time of\nX-ray scattered halo photons can reveal information of the distances of the\ninterstellar dust and the point source.

The one which is closer to the observer\ngives the X-ray scattered at larger observational angles; whereas the farther\none, which is in the vicinity of the point source, explains the halo with a\nsmaller angular size. By comparing the observational angle of the scattered\nhalo photons with that predicted by different dust grain models, we are able to\ndetermine the normalized dust distance. With the delay times of the scattered\nhalo photons, we can determine the point source distance, given a dust grain\nmodel.

As with Swift, GRBs are initially\nlocated with a coded-mask X-ray camera. However, the NGRG has two new features:\nFirst, a beam-steering system to begin optical observations within ~ 1 s after\nlocation; second, a near-IR (NIR) camera viewing the same sky, for sensitivity\nto extinguished bursts. These features allow measurement of the rise phase of\nGRB optical-NIR emission. Thus far, the rise time and transition between prompt\nand afterglow in the optical and NIR are rarely measured. Rapid-response\nmeasurements explore many science topics including optical emission mechanisms\n(synchrotron vs. SSC, photospheric emission) and jet characteristics (reverse\nvs. forward shock emission, baryon-dominated vs. magnetic dominated). Rapid\noptical-NIR response can measure dynamic evolution of extinction due to\nvaporization of dust, and separate star system and galaxy dust extinction. We\ndiscuss these measurements, giving reliable detection rate estimates from\nanalysis of Swift data and scaled Swift performance. The NGRG will explore\noptical/NIR emission measured earlier than ever before, and potentially\nfainter, more extinguished GRBs than ever before. In the current era, costs are\nimportant.

Models of the GC are considered that have not yet achieved a\nsteady state under the influence of random gravitational encounters. Contrary\nto some recent claims that mass-segregation can rapidly rebuild a density cusp\nin the stars, we find that time scales associated with cusp regrowth are longer\nthan the Hubble time. These results cast doubts on standard models that\npostulate high densities of BHs near the GC and motivate studies that start\nfrom initial conditions which correspond to well-defined physical models. For\nthe first time, we consider the distribution of BHs in a dissipationless\nformation model for the Milky Way nuclear cluster (NC), in which massive\nstellar clusters merge in the GC to form a nucleus. We simulate the successive\ninspiral of massive clusters containing an inner dense cluster of BHs. The\npre-existing mass segregation is not completely erased as the clusters are\ndisrupted by the massive black hole tidal field.

As a consequence of the global\ninteraction, the persistence probability saturates for all values of the\ncoupling parameter, in contrast to the transition observed in the temporal\nbehavior of the persistence in coupled maps on regular lattices. A\ndiscontinuous transition from a non-ordered state to a collective phase-ordered\nstate takes place at a critical value of the coupling.

An uprising alternative to GPU is\nIntel MIC; supercomputers like Tianhe-2, currently top of TOP500, is built with\n48,000 MIC boards to offer ~55 PFLOPS. The CPU-like architecture of MIC allows\nCPU-based software to be parallelized easily; however, the performance is often\ninferior to GPU counterparts as an MIC board contains only ~60 cores (while a\nGPU board typically has over a thousand cores). Results: To better utilize\nMIC-enabled computers for NGS data analysis, we developed a new short-read\naligner MICA that is optimized in view of MICs limitation and the extra\nparallelism inside each MIC core. Experiments on aligning 150bp paired-end\nreads show that MICA using one MIC board is 4.9 times faster than the BWA-MEM\n(using 6-core of a top-end CPU), and slightly faster than SOAP3-dp (using a\nGPU).

Summary: MICA can be readily used by MIC-enabled supercomputers for\nproduction purpose.

A discontinuity in random space\nmakes the application of generalized polynomial chaos expansion techniques\nprohibitively expensive. The reason is that for discontinuous problems, the\nexpansion converges very slowly. An alternative to using higher terms in the\nexpansion is to divide the random space in smaller elements where a lower\ndegree polynomial is adequate to describe the randomness. In general, the\npartition of the random space is a dynamic process since some areas of the\nrandom space, particularly around the discontinuity, need more refinement than\nothers as time evolves.

Of particular interest is the infinite-time {\\it saturation}\nlimit in which the available space for another sphere tends to zero. However,\nthe associated saturation density has been determined in all previous\ninvestigations by extrapolating the density results for near-saturation\nconfigurations to the saturation limit, which necessarily introduces numerical\nuncertainties. We have refined an algorithm devised by us [S. Torquato, O.\nUche, and F.~H. Stillinger, Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 74}, 061308 (2006)] to generate\nRSA packings of identical hyperspheres. The improved algorithm produce such\npackings that are guaranteed to contain no available space using finite\ncomputational time with heretofore unattained precision and across the widest\nrange of dimensions ($2 \\le d \\le 8$). We have also calculated the packing and\ncovering densities, pair correlation function $g_2(r)$ and structure factor\n$S(k)$ of the saturated RSA configurations. As the space dimension increases,\nwe find that pair correlations markedly diminish, consistent with a recently\nproposed \"decorrelation\" principle, and the degree of \"hyperuniformity\"\n(suppression of infinite-wavelength density fluctuations) increases. We have\nalso calculated the void exclusion probability in order to compute the\nso-called quantizer error of the RSA packings, which is related to the second\nmoment of inertia of the average Voronoi cell. Our algorithm is easily\ngeneralizable to generate saturated RSA packings of nonspherical particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 03:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-21"}

It is the essence of many\nsophisticated protocols for quantum communication and computation. In order to\nrealize flying qubits in these schemes, photons are an optimal choice, however,\nteleporting a photonic qubit has been limited due to experimental\ninefficiencies and restrictions. Major disadvantages have been the\nfundamentally probabilistic nature of linear-optics Bell measurements as well\nas the need for either destroying the teleported qubit or attenuating the input\nqubit when the detectors do not resolve photon numbers. Here we experimentally\nrealize fully deterministic, unconditional quantum teleportation of photonic\nqubits. The key element is to make use of a \"hybrid\" technique:\ncontinuous-variable (CV) teleportation of a discrete-variable, photonic qubit.\nBy optimally tuning the receiver's feedforward gain, the CV teleporter acts as\na pure loss channel, while the input dual-rail encoded qubit, based on a single\nphoton, represents a quantum error detection code against amplitude damping and\nhence remains completely intact for most teleportation events. This allows for\na faithful qubit transfer even with imperfect CV entangled states: the overall\ntransfer fidelities range from 0.79 to 0.82 for four distinct qubits, all of\nthem exceeding the classical limit of teleportation. Furthermore, even for a\nrelatively low level of the entanglement, qubits are teleported much more\nefficiently than in previous experiments, albeit post-selectively (taking into\naccount only the qubit subspaces), with a fidelity comparable to the previously\nreported values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 05:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-21"}

We show that the three-mode gain for single cavity\ninteractions can be monitored by observing beat signals in the transmitted or\nreflected light due to the thermal excitation of the many hundreds of\ndetectable acoustic modes. We show that three mode interaction signals can be\nused at low optical power to predict parametric instabilities that could occur\nat higher power. In addition, at any power, the observed mode amplitudes can be\nused to control the interferometer operating point against slow environmental\nperturbations. We summarize data on an 80m cavity that demonstrates these\neffects and propose testing on full scale interferometer cavities to evaluate\nwhether the technique has practical benefits that can be extended from single\ncavities to dual recycling interferometers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 05:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In order to measure the magnetic and electric fields of\nchromospheric jets, the full Stokes spectra of the Paschen series of neutral\nhydrogen in a surge and in some active region jets that took place at the solar\nlimb were observed on May 5, 2012, using the spectropolarimeter of the Domeless\nSolar Telescope at Hida observatory, Japan. First, we inverted the Stokes\nspectra taking into account only the effect of magnetic fields on the energy\nstructure and polarization of the hydrogen levels. Having found no definitive\nevidence of the effects of electric fields in the observed Stokes profiles, we\nthen estimated an upper bound for these fields by calculating the polarization\ndegree under the magnetic field configuration derived in the first step, with\nthe additional presence of a perpendicular (Lorentz type) electric field of\nvarying strength. The inferred direction of the magnetic field on the plane of\nthe sky (POS) approximately aligns to the active region jets and the surge,\nwith magnetic field strengths in the range 10 G < B < 640 G for the surge.\nUsing magnetic field strengths of 70, 200, and 600 G, we obtained upper limits\nfor possible electric fields of 0.04, 0.3, and 0.8 V/cm, respectively. Because\nthe velocity of neutral atoms of hydrogen moving across the magnetic field\nderived from these upper limits of the Lorentz electric field is far below the\nbulk velocity of the plasma perpendicular to the magnetic field as measured by\nthe Doppler shift, we conclude that the neutral atoms must be highly frozen to\nthe magnetic field in the surge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 06:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

A critical step in fingerprint\nidentification system is thinning of the input fingerprint image. The\nperformance of a minutiae extraction algorithm relies heavily on the quality of\nthe thinning algorithm. So, a fast fingerprint thinning algorithm is proposed.\nThe algorithm works directly on the gray-scale image as binarization of\nfingerprint causes many spurious minutiae and also removes many important\nfeatures. The performance of the thinning algorithm is evaluated and\nexperimental results show that the proposed thinning algorithm is both fast and\naccurate. A new minutiae-based fingerprint matching technique is proposed. The\nmain idea is that each fingerprint is represented by a minutiae table of just\ntwo columns in the database. The number of different minutiae types\n(terminations and bifurcations) found in each track of a certain width around\nthe core point of the fingerprint is recorded in this table. Each row in the\ntable represents a certain track, in the first column, the number of\nterminations in each track is recorded, in the second column, the number of\nbifurcations in each track is recorded. The algorithm is rotation and\ntranslation invariant, and needs less storage size. Experimental results show\nthat recognition accuracy is 98%, with Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2%. Finally,\nthe integrity of the data transmission via communication channels must be\nsecure all the way from the scanner to the application. After applying Gaussian\nnoise addition, and JPEG compression with high and moderate quality factors on\nthe watermarked fingerprint images, recognition accuracy decreases slightly to\nreach 96%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 09:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-21"}

We present AWE, the first erasure-coded distributed implementation of a\nmulti-writer multi-reader read/write storage object that is, at the same time:\n(1) asynchronous, (2) wait-free, (3) atomic, (4) amnesic, (i.e., with data\nnodes storing a bounded number of values) and (5) Byzantine fault-tolerant\n(BFT) using the optimal number of nodes. Furthermore, AWE is efficient since it\ndoes not use public-key cryptography and requires data nodes that support only\nreads and writes, further reducing the cost of deployment and ownership of a\ndistributed storage solution. Notably, AWE stores metadata separately from\n$k$-out-of-$n$ erasure-coded fragments. This enables AWE to be the first BFT\nprotocol that uses as few as $2t+k$ data nodes to tolerate $t$ Byzantine nodes,\nfor any $k \\ge 1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 10:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-21"}

This direct approach allows us to take into\naccount only the effects of dynamical evolution and to gauge how and to what\nextent they affect the initial chemical conditions. The initial [Fe/H]\ndistribution increases with R in the inner disk up to R ~ 10 kpc and decreases\nfor larger R. We find that the initial chemical profile does not undergo major\ntransformations after 6 Gyr of dynamical evolution.

Gaussian processes provide an elegant way of\nconstructing such additive models, but suffer from computational difficulties\narising from the matrix operations that need to be performed. Recently Heersink\n& Furrer have shown that functional additive model give rise to covariance\nmatrices that have a specific form they called quasi-Kronecker (QK), whose\ninverses are relatively tractable. We show that under additional assumptions\nthe two-level additive model leads to a class of matrices we call restricted\nquasi-Kronecker, which enjoy many interesting properties. In particular, we\nformulate matrix factorisations whose complexity scales only linearly in the\nnumber of functions in latent field, an enormous improvement over the cubic\nscaling of na\\\"ive approaches.

However, this approach inherently\nassumes that the energy source has an unbounded capacity, which is not always\nrealistic. For example, an autonomous robotic device has a battery of finite\ncapacity that has to be recharged periodically, and the total amount of energy\nconsumed between two successive charging cycles is bounded by the capacity.\nHence, a controller minimizing the mean-payoff must obey this restriction. In\nthis paper we study the controller synthesis problem for consumption systems\nwith a finite battery capacity, where the task of the controller is to minimize\nthe mean-payoff while preserving the functionality of the system encoded by a\ngiven linear-time property. We show that an optimal controller always exists,\nand it may either need only finite memory or require infinite memory (it is\ndecidable in polynomial time which of the two cases holds). Further, we show\nhow to compute an effective description of an optimal controller in polynomial\ntime. Finally, we consider the limit values achievable by larger and larger\nbattery capacity, show that these values are computable in polynomial time, and\nwe also analyze the corresponding rate of convergence.

As such, they are closer to\nreality than other models. However, nearly all theoretic work in the SINR model\ndepends on the assumption of smooth geometric decay, one that is true in free\nspace but is far off in actual environments. The challenge is to model\nrealistic environments, including walls, obstacles, reflections and anisotropic\nantennas, without making the models algorithmically impractical or analytically\nintractable.\n  We present a simple solution that allows the modeling of arbitrary static\nsituations by moving from geometry to arbitrary decay spaces. The complexity of\na setting is captured by a metricity parameter Z that indicates how far the\ndecay space is from satisfying the triangular inequality. All results that hold\nin the SINR model in general metrics carry over to decay spaces, with the\nresulting time complexity and approximation depending on Z in the same way that\nthe original results depends on the path loss term alpha. For distributed\nalgorithms, that to date have appeared to necessarily depend on the planarity,\nwe indicate how they can be adapted to arbitrary decay spaces.\n  Finally, we explore the dependence on Z in the approximability of core\nproblems.

Less well known topics include the\nequal-time wave function of Positronium in motion and the properties of the\nDirac wave function for a linear potential. The presentation emphasizes\nphysical aspects and provides the framework for Part 2, which discusses the\nderivation of relativistic bound states at Born level in QED and QCD. A central\naspect is the maintenance of Poincar\\'e invariance. The transformation of the\nwave function under boosts is studied in detail in D=1+1 dimensions, and its\ngeneralization to D=3+1 is indicated. Solving Gauss' law for $A^0$ with a\nnon-vanishing boundary condition leads to a linear potential for QCD mesons,\nand an analogous confining potential for baryons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 14:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-28"}

To cope with\nthe low Mach number conditions in the lower convection zone, we use the reduced\nspeed of sound technique (RSST), which is simple to implement and requires only\nlocal communication in the parallel computation. In addition, the RSST allows\nus to expand the computational domain upward to about $0.99 R_{\\odot}$ as it\ncan also handle compressible flows. Using this approach, we study the solar\nconvection zone on the global scale, including small-scale near-surface\nconvection. In particular, we investigate the influence of the top boundary\ncondition on the convective structure throughout the convection zone as well as\non small-scale dynamo action. Our main conclusions are: 1. The small-scale\ndownflows generated in the near-surface layer penetrate into deeper layers to\nsome extent and excite small-scale turbulence in the region $>0.9R_\\odot$,\nwhere $R_\\odot$ is the solar radius. 2. In the deeper convection zone\n($<0.9R_\\odot$), the convection is not influenced by the location of the upper\nboundary. 3. Using an LES approach, we can achieve small-scale dynamo action\nand maintain a field of about $0.15-0.25 B_\\mathrm{eq}$ throughout the\nconvection zone, where $B_\\mathrm{eq}$ is the equipartition magnetic field to\nthe kinetic energy. 4. The overall dynamo efficiency varies significantly in\nthe convection zone as a consequence of the downward directed Poynting flux and\nthe depth variation of the intrinsic convective scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 14:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Moreover, the model enables the\nvirtual agent to display its social attitude through its non-verbal behaviour.\nThe proposed model has been developed in the context of job interview\nsimulation. The methodology used to develop such a model combined a theoretical\nand an empirical approach.

Then, these transport equations are\nsolved numerically in order to study the thermalization of the quark-gluon\nplasma.

Thus, biological principles of\norganization should also be the principles underlying mental operations.\nPractopoiesis states that the key for achieving intelligence through adaptation\nis an arrangement in which mechanisms laying a lower level of organization, by\ntheir operations and interaction with the environment, enable creation of\nmechanisms lying at a higher level of organization. When such an organizational\nadvance of a system occurs, it is called a traverse. A case of traverse is when\nplasticity mechanisms (at a lower level of organization), by their operations,\ncreate a neural network anatomy (at a higher level of organization). Another\ncase is the actual production of behavior by that network, whereby the\nmechanisms of neuronal activity operate to create motor actions. Practopoietic\ntheory explains why the adaptability of a system increases with each increase\nin the number of traverses. With a larger number of traverses, a system can be\nrelatively small and yet, produce a higher degree of adaptive/intelligent\nbehavior than a system with a lower number of traverses. The present analyses\nindicate that the two well-known traverses-neural plasticity and neural\nactivity-are not sufficient to explain human mental capabilities. At least one\nadditional traverse is needed, which is named anapoiesis for its contribution\nin reconstructing knowledge e.g., from long-term memory into working memory.\nThe conclusions bear implications for brain theory, the mind-body explanatory\ngap, and developments of artificial intelligence technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 09:17:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 18:45:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 21:20:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2014 18:22:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 18:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-11"}

This paper evaluates the Medicare 2011 Transaction\nData Set which details the transfer of funds from Medicare to private and\npublic clinical care facilities for specific clinical services for the\noperational year 2011. Methods: Data mining was conducted to establish the\nrelationships between reported and computed transaction values in the data set\nto better understand the drivers of Medicare transactions at a programmatic\nlevel. Results: The models averaged 88 for average model accuracy and 38 for\naverage Kappa during training. Some reported classes are highly independent\nfrom the available data as their predictability remains stable regardless of\nredaction of supporting and contradictory evidence. DRG or procedure type\nappears to be unpredictable from the available financial transaction values.\nConclusions: Overlay hypotheses such as charges being driven by the volume\nserved or DRG being related to charges or payments is readily false in this\nanalysis despite 28 million Americans being billed through Medicare in 2011 and\nthe program distributing over 70 billion in this transaction set alone. It may\nbe impossible to predict the dependencies and data structures the payer of last\nresort without data from payers of first and second resort. Political concerns\nabout Medicare would be better served focusing on these first and second order\npayer systems as what Medicare costs is not dependent on Medicare itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 03:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-28"}
