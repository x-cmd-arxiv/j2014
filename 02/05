This idea has\nfound its way in numerous applications such as Google's PageRank algorithm and\nothers. Recently, new studies suggested that human navigation may better be\nmodeled using higher order Markov chain models, i.e., the next page depends on\na longer history of past clicks. Yet, this finding is preliminary and does not\naccount for the higher complexity of higher order Markov chain models which is\nwhy the memoryless model is still widely used. In this work we thoroughly\npresent a diverse array of advanced inference methods for determining the\nappropriate Markov chain order. We highlight strengths and weaknesses of each\nmethod and apply them for investigating memory and structure of human\nnavigation on the Web. Our experiments reveal that the complexity of higher\norder models grows faster than their utility, and thus we confirm that the\nmemoryless model represents a quite practical model for human navigation on a\npage level. However, when we expand our analysis to a topical level, where we\nabstract away from specific page transitions to transitions between topics, we\nfind that the memoryless assumption is violated and specific regularities can\nbe observed. We report results from experiments with two types of navigational\ndatasets (goal-oriented vs. free form) and observe interesting structural\ndifferences that make a strong argument for more contextual studies of human\nnavigation in future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 16:25:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jun 2014 08:58:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

This is due to\nblending of the peaks in the periodogram due to the finite duration of the time\nseries. Prewhitening is equivalent to adding a frequency to the data which is\ncarefully chosen to interfere destructively with a given frequency in the data.\nSince the frequency extracted from a blended peak is not quite correct, the\ninterference is not destructive with the result that many additional fictitious\nfrequencies are added to the data. In data with very high signal-to-noise, such\nas the CoRoT data, these spurious frequencies are highly significant.\nContinuous prewhitening thus causes a cascade of spurious frequencies which\nleads to a much larger estimate of the mode density than is actually the case.\nThe results reported for HD 50844 are consistent with this effect.

Since the vortex symmetry of a twisted photon is more complex that that\nof a plane-wave, evaluation of the atomic form factor is also more complex for\ntwisted photons. On the other hand, the twisted photon has additional\nparameters, including the OAM quantum number, $\\ell$, the nodal radial number,\n$p$, and the Rayleigh range, $z_R$ that determines the cone angle of the\nvortex. This Rayleigh range may be used as a variable parameter to control, in\nnew ways, the interaction of twisted photons with matter. Here we address: i)\nnormalization of the vortex atomic form factor, ii) displacement of target\natoms away from the center of the beam vortex, and iii) formulation of\ntransition probabilities for a variety of photon-atom processes.

These\nALMA observations resolve the dust-depleted disk cavities and extended gaseous\ndisks, revealing large-scale asymmetries in the dust emission of both disks. We\nmodeled these disks structures with a ring and an azimuthal gaussian, where the\nazimuthal gaussian is motivated by the steady-state vortex solution from Lyra &\nLin (2013). Compared to recent observations of HD 142527, Oph IRS 48, and LkHa\n330, these are low-contrast (< 2) asymmetries. Nevertheless, a ring alone is\nnot a good fit, and the addition of a vortex prescription describes these data\nmuch better. The asymmetric component encompasses 15% and 28% of the total disk\nemission in SAO 206462 and SR 21 respectively, which corresponds to a lower\nlimit of 2 MJup of material within the asymmetry for both disks.

The oscillations present in the fast\nrotating Delta Scuti star KIC 8054146 allow us to test the most general and\ngeneric aspects of such a theory. The only direct way to separate the parent\nand coupled (child) modes is to examine the correlations in amplitude\nvariability between the different frequencies. For the dominant family of\nrelated frequencies, only a single mode and a triplet are the origins of nine\ndominant frequency peaks ranging from 2.93 to 66.30 cycles per day (as well as\ndozens of small-amplitude combination modes and a predicted and detected third\nhigh-frequency triplet). The mode-coupling model correctly predicts the large\namplitude variations of the coupled modes as a product of the amplitudes of the\nparent modes, while the phase changes are also correctly modeled. This differs\nfrom the behavior of 'normal' combination frequencies in that the amplitudes\nare three orders of magnitude larger and may exceed even the amplitudes of the\nparent modes. We show that two dominant low frequencies at 5.86 and 2.93 cycles\nper day in the gravity-mode region are not harmonics of each other, and their\nproperties follow those of the almost equidistant high-frequency triplet.

As one ages there\nare a number of physical, chemical and biological changes that take place.\nTherefore it is logical to assume that the brain is no exception to this\nphenomenon. The principle purpose of this project is to use models of neural\ndynamics and learning based on the underlying principle of self-organised\ncriticality, to account for the age related cognitive effects. In this regard\nlearning in neural networks can serve as a model for the acquisition of skills\nand knowledge in early development stages i.e. the ageing process and\ncriticality in the network serves as the optimum state of cognitive abilities.\nPossible candidate mechanisms for ageing in a neural network are loss of\nconnectivity and neurons, increase in the level of noise, reduction in white\nmatter or more interestingly longer learning history and the competition among\nseveral optimization objectives. In this paper we are primarily interested in\nthe affect of the longer learning history on memory and thus the optimality in\nthe brain. Hence it is hypothesized that prolonged learning in the form of\nassociative memory patterns can destroy the state of criticality in the\nnetwork. We base our model on Tsodyks and Markrams [49] model of dynamic\nsynapses, in the process to explore the effect of combining standard Hebbian\nlearning with the phenomenon of Self-organised criticality. The project mainly\nconsists of evaluations and simulations of networks of integrate and\nfire-neurons that have been subjected to various combinations of neural-level\nageing effects, with the aim of establishing the primary hypothesis and\nunderstanding the decline of cognitive abilities due to ageing, using one of\nits important characteristics, a longer learning history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 19:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-07"}

The magnetic field energy density is small everywhere and\nevolves passively in the post-shock wind. Most synchrotron emission arises in\nrecent post-shock material as it flows back along the radio cavity wall.\nBecause it experienced less adiabatic expansion, the magnetic field in this\nyoung backflow is larger than elsewhere in the radio lobe, explaining the\nobserved radio synchrotron limb-brightening.

For the\nfirst time, we fit 2-dimensional models comprising a single Sersic fit and\ntwo-component (i.e., bulge + disk) decompositions not only to the H-band light\ndistributions, but also to the stellar mass maps reconstructed from resolved\nstellar population modeling. We confirm that the increased bulge prominence\namong quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-optical\nobservations, remains in place when considering the distributions of stellar\nmass. Moreover, we observe an increase of the typical Sersic index and\nbulge-to-total ratio (with median B/T reaching 40-50%) among star-forming\ngalaxies above 10^11 Msun.

At very high energy, the contribution from semi-leptonic\ndecays of charmed hadrons, known as the prompt neutrino flux, dominates over\nthe conventional flux from pion and kaon decays. This is due to the very short\nlifetime of the charmed hadrons, which therefore do not lose energy before they\ndecay. The calculation of this process is difficult because the Bjorken-x at\nwhich the parton distribution functions are evaluated is very small. This is a\nregion where QCD is not well understood, and large logarithms must be resummed.\nAvailable parton distribution functions are not known at such small x and\nextrapolations must be made. Theoretically, the fast rise of the structure\nfunctions for small x ultimately leads to parton saturation. This contribution\ndescribes the \"ERS\" calculation of the prompt neutrino flux, which includes\nparton saturation effects in the QCD production cross section of charm quarks.\nThe ERS flux calculation is used by e.g. the IceCube collaboration as a\nstandard benchmark background. We are now updating this calculation to take\ninto account the recent LHC data on the charm cross section, as well as recent\ntheoretical developments in QCD.

Background evolution is a large source of uncertainty\nin pre-reionization predictions of the cosmological 21cm signal, which can be\nobserved with future radio telescopes. To address this, we perform\nzero-dimentional one-zone calculations that follow the density, chemical\nabundances, and temperature of gas in the central regions of dark matter halos,\nincluding hierarchical growth and an evolving LW background. We begin by\nstudying the physics of halos subjected to a background that increases\nexponentially with redshift.

It turns out that\nthe 2DEG originates from those spontaneously formed surface donor defects\n(oxygen vacancy), but the density of 2DEG is controlled by the interfacial\nanti-site acceptor defects (Al-on-Ti). The interface magnetism is found to\noriginate from the un-ionized deep Ti-on-Al anti-site donor defects within the\nLaAlO3 side near the interface. Our results suggest practical design guidelines\nfor inducing and controlling both 2DEG and magnetism at polar-nonpolar oxide\ninterfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 21:58:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 21:14:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Aug 2014 13:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-15"}

We aim to characterize how the charge state of\nPAHs can be used as a probe of flows of gas through protoplanetary gaps. In\nthis context, our goal is to understand the PAH spectra of four transitional\ndisks. In addition, we want to explain the observed correlation between PAH\nionization (traced by the 6.2/11.3 feature ratio) and the disk mass (traced by\nthe 1.3 mm luminosity). We implement a model to calculate the charge state of\nPAHs in the radiative transfer code MCMax. The emission spectra and ionization\nbalance are calculated. A benchmark modeling grid is presented that shows how\nPAH ionization and luminosity behave as a function of star and disk properties.\nThe PAH ionization is most sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the\nelectron density. In optically thick disks, where the UV field is low and the\nelectron density is high, PAHs are predominantly neutral. Ionized PAHs trace\nlow-density optically thin disk regions where the UV field is high and the\nelectron density is low. Such regions are characteristic of gas flows through\nthe gaps of transitional disks. We demonstrate that fitting the PAH spectra of\nfour transitional disks requires a contribution of ionized PAHs in gas flows\nthrough the gap. The PAH spectra of transitional disks can be understood as\nsuperpositions of neutral and ionized PAHs. For HD97048, neutral PAHs in the\noptically thick disk dominate the spectrum. In the cases of HD169142, HD135344B\nand Oph IRS 48, small amounts of ionized PAHs located in the gas flows through\nthe gap are strong contributors to the total PAH luminosity. The observed trend\nbetween the disk mass and PAH ionization may imply that lower-mass disks have\nlarger gaps.

To enable analysis of these\nimplicit networks, we develop a probabilistic model that combines\nmutually-exciting point processes with random graph models.

To learn these representations\nwe introduce nested dropout, a procedure for stochastically removing coherent\nnested sets of hidden units in a neural network. We first present a sequence of\ntheoretical results in the simple case of a semi-linear autoencoder. We\nrigorously show that the application of nested dropout enforces identifiability\nof the units, which leads to an exact equivalence with PCA. We then extend the\nalgorithm to deep models and demonstrate the relevance of ordered\nrepresentations to a number of applications. Specifically, we use the ordered\nproperty of the learned codes to construct hash-based data structures that\npermit very fast retrieval, achieving retrieval in time logarithmic in the\ndatabase size and independent of the dimensionality of the representation. This\nallows codes that are hundreds of times longer than currently feasible for\nretrieval. We therefore avoid the diminished quality associated with short\ncodes, while still performing retrieval that is competitive in speed with\nexisting methods. We also show that ordered representations are a promising way\nto learn adaptive compression for efficient online data reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2014 00:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-06"}

Two main classes of massive star formation theory are under\nactive study, Core Accretion and Competitive Accretion. In Core Accretion, the\ninitial conditions are self-gravitating, centrally concentrated cores that\ncondense with a range of masses from the surrounding, fragmenting clump\nenvironment. They then undergo relatively ordered collapse via a central disk\nto form a single star or a small-N multiple. In this case, the pre-stellar core\nmass function has a similar form to the stellar initial mass function. In\nCompetitive Accretion, the material that forms a massive star is drawn more\nchaotically from a wider region of the clump without passing through a phase of\nbeing in a massive, coherent core. In this case, massive star formation must\nproceed hand in hand with star cluster formation. If stellar densities become\nvery high near the cluster center, then collisions between stars may also help\nto form the most massive stars. We review recent theoretical and observational\nprogress towards understanding massive star formation, considering physical and\nchemical processes, comparisons with low and intermediate-mass stars, and\nconnections to star cluster formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2014 01:09:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 16:03:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 00:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The compression was\nfound to be extremely strong from 1846 to 2035 UT when the dense plasma of fast\nerupting filament produced the solar wind dynamic pressure Pd peaked up to >100\nnPa and, in the first time, the upstream solar wind was observed at\ngeosynchronous orbit during almost 2 hours. Under the extreme compression, the\nouter magnetosphere at L > 5 was pushed inward and the outer radiation belt\nparticles with energies of several tens of keV moved earthward, became\nadiabatically accelerated and accumulated in the inner magnetosphere at L < 4\nthat produced the intensified ring current with an exceptionally long lifetime.\nThe observations were compared with predictions of various empirical and first\nprinciples models.

The ability\nto accurately model distributions over functions is critical to the\neffectiveness of Bayesian optimization. Although Gaussian processes provide a\nflexible prior over functions which can be queried efficiently, there are\nvarious classes of functions that remain difficult to model. One of the most\nfrequently occurring of these is the class of non-stationary functions. The\noptimization of the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms is a problem\ndomain in which parameters are often manually transformed a priori, for example\nby optimizing in \"log-space,\" to mitigate the effects of spatially-varying\nlength scale. We develop a methodology for automatically learning a wide family\nof bijective transformations or warpings of the input space using the Beta\ncumulative distribution function. We further extend the warping framework to\nmulti-task Bayesian optimization so that multiple tasks can be warped into a\njointly stationary space.

These systems are built by taking the driver reaction times into\naccount. However, most of the existing literature focuses on characterizing how\ndriver reaction times vary across an entire population. Therefore, many of the\nwarnings that are given turn out to be false alarms. A false alarm occurs\nwhenever a warning is sent, but it is not needed. This would nagate any safety\nbenefit of the system, and could even reduce the overall safety if warnings\nbecome a distraction. In this paper, we propose our solution to address the\ndescribed problem; First, we briefly describe our method for estimating the\ndistribution of brake response times for a particular driver using data from a\nVehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) system. Then, we investigate how brake\nresponse times of individual drivers can be used in collision warning\nalgorithms to reduce false alarm rates while still maintaining a high level of\nsafety. This will yield a system that is overall more reliable and trustworthy\nfor drivers, which could lead to wider adoption and applicability for V2V/V2I\ncommunication systems. Moreover, we show how false alarm rate varies with\nrespect to probability of accident. Our simulation results show that by\nindividualizing collision warnings the number of false alarms can be reduced\nmore than $50\\%$. Then, we conclude safety applications could potentially take\nfull advantage of being customized to an individual's characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2014 04:19:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 2019 00:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

Whether\nlarge scale fields are amplified in situ or a remnant from previous stages of\nan object's history is often debated for objects without a definitive magnetic\nactivity cycle. Magnetic helicity, a measure of twist and linkage of magnetic\nfield lines, is a unifying tool for understanding large scale field evolution\nfor both mechanisms of origin. Its importance stems from its two basic\nproperties: (1) magnetic helicity is typically better conserved than magnetic\nenergy; and (2) the magnetic energy associated with a fixed amount of magnetic\nhelicity is minimized when the system relaxes this helical structure to the\nlargest scale available. Here I discuss how magnetic helicity has come to help\nus understand the saturation of and sustenance of large scale dynamos, the need\nfor either local or global helicity fluxes to avoid dynamo quenching, and the\nassociated observational consequences.

A lot of researches on the structures and processes on\nreal and artificial fractal complex networks have been done, drawing an analogy\nto critical phenomena. However, the non-Markovian dynamics on fractal networks\nhas not been understood well yet. We here study the self-avoiding walk on\ncomplex fractal networks through the mapping of the self-avoiding walk to the\nn-vector model by a generating function formalism. First, we analytically\ncalculate the critical exponent {\\nu} and the effective coordination number\n(the connective constant) by a renormalization-group analysis in various\nfractal dimensions. We find that the exponent {\\nu} is equal to the exponent of\ndisplacement, which describes the speed of diffusion in terms of the shortest\ndistance. Second, by obtaining an exact solution, we present an example which\nsupports the well-known conjecture that the universality class of the\nself-avoiding walk is not determined only by a fractal dimension. Our finding\nsuggests that the scaling theory of polymers can be applied to graphs which\nlack the Euclidian distance as well. Furthermore, the self-avoiding walk has\nbeen exactly solved only on a few lattices embedded in the Euclidian space, but\nwe show that consideration on general graphs can simplify analytic calculations\nand leads to a better understanding of critical phenomena. The scaling theory\nof the self-avoiding path will shed light on the relationship between path\nnumeration problems in graph theory and statistical nature of paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2014 07:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-06"}

To investigate the growth of such instabilities, we\nderive a local dispersion relation for an idealized self-gravitating filament,\nand study some of its properties. Our idealized picture consists of an infinite\nself-gravitating and rotating cylinder with pressure and density related by a\npolytropic equation of state.

Good spatial ability\nis still required to make sense of the device and its interface, as well as the\nneed to memorize positions on screen or keys and associated actions in a\nkeypad.

Worse, the entire blind population is recurrently thought of as\nhomogeneous (often stereotypically so). Thus all users face the same solutions,\nignoring their specific capabilities and needs. We usually ignore this\ndiversity as we have the ability to adapt and become experts in interfaces that\nwere probably maladjusted to begin with. This adaptation is not always within\nreach.

The duality between monads and\ncomonads corresponds, in general, to a symmetry between construction and\nobservation, for instance between raising an exception and looking up a state.\nThanks to the properties of adjunction one may go one step further: the\ncoKleisli-on-Kleisli category of a monad provides a kind of observation with\nrespect to a given construction, while dually the Kleisli-on-coKleisli category\nof a comonad provides a kind of construction with respect to a given\nobservation. In the previous examples this gives rise to catching an exception\nand updating a state. However, the interpretation of computational effects is\nusually based on a category which is not self-dual, like the category of sets.\nThis leads to a breaking of the monad-comonad duality. For instance, in a\ndistributive category the state effect has much better properties than the\nexception effect.

The third electronic transition observed\naround 40 000 cm-1 (5.0 eV) is even broader with no apparent vibrational\nstructures, which is indicative of either a fast non-radiative process or a\nvery large change in geometry between the excited and the ground states. The\noscillator strengths calculated for tropylium and methyl tropylium are weak.\nTherefore, these isomeric structures are most likely not responsible for these\nabsorption features.

In the present paper, the quantum form of the LIA (which\nincludes mutual friction effects) is put into correspondence with a type of\ncomplex nonlinear dispersive partial differential equation (PDE) with cubic\nnonlinearity (similar in form to a Ginsburg-Landau equation, with additional\nnonlinear terms). Transforming the quantum LIA in such a way enables one to\nobtain quantum vortex filament solutions once solutions to this dispersive PDE\nare known. From our quantum Hasimoto transformation, we determine the form and\nbehavior of Stokes waves and a standing 1-soliton solution under normal and\nbinormal friction effects. The soliton solution on a quantum vortex filament is\na natural generalization of the classical 1-soliton solution constructed\nmathematically by Hasimoto (which motivated subsequent real-world experiments).\nThe quantum Hasimoto transformation is useful when normal fluid velocity is\nrelatively weak, so for the case where the normal fluid velocity is dominant we\nresort to other approaches. We consider the dynamics of the tangent vector to\nthe vortex filament directly from the quantum LIA, and this approach, while\nless elegant than the quantum Hasimoto transformation, enables us to study\nwaves primarily driven by the normal fluid velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2014 01:20:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2014 22:20:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 22:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}

To do so, prior solutions calculate integrity metadata and\nrequire the repository to store it alongside the actual data objects. This\nintegrity metadata is essential for regularly verifying the correctness of the\nstored data objects. To safeguard and detect damage to this metadata, prior\nsolutions rely on widely visible media, that is unaffiliated third parties, to\nstore and provide back digests of the metadata to verify it is intact. However,\nthey do not address recovery of the integrity metadata in case of damage or\nattack by an adversary. In essence, they do not preserve this metadata. We\nintroduce IntegrityCatalog, a system that collects all integrity related\nmetadata in a single component, and treats them as first class objects,\nmanaging both their integrity and their preservation. We introduce a\ntreap-based persistent authenticated dictionary managing arbitrary length\nkey/value pairs, which we use to store all integrity metadata, accessible\nsimply by object name. Additionally, IntegrityCatalog is a distributed system\nthat includes a network protocol that manages both corruption detection and\npreservation of this metadata, using administrator-selected network peers with\ntwo possible roles. Verifiers store and offer attestations on digests and have\nminimal storage requirements, while preservers efficiently synchronize a\ncomplete copy of the catalog to assist in recovery in case of a detected\ncatalog compromise on the local system. We describe our prototype\nimplementation of IntegrityCatalog, measure its performance empirically, and\ndemonstrate its effectiveness in real-world situations, with worst measured\nthroughput of approximately 1K insertions per second, and 2K verified search\noperations per second.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 17:52:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 09:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-26"}
