The former provides a\nhierarchy of approximations of different resolution, whereas the latter gives\nan efficient way to estimate quantities of interest using samples on different\nlevels. The number of basis functions in the online GMsFEM stage can be varied\nto determine the solution resolution and the computational cost, and to\nefficiently generate samples at different levels. In particular, it is cheap to\ngenerate samples on coarse grids but with low resolution, and it is expensive\nto generate samples on fine grids with high accuracy. By suitably choosing the\nnumber of samples at different levels, one can leverage the expensive\ncomputation in larger fine-grid spaces toward smaller coarse-grid spaces, while\nretaining the accuracy of the final Monte Carlo estimate.

Lojasiewicz proved this result in the early 1960s as\na consequence of his gradient inequality.\n  Many problems in calculus of variations are questions about critical points\nor gradient flow lines of an infinite dimensional functional. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, even blowups at singularities of many nonlinear PDE's can, in a\ncertain sense, be thought of as limits of infinite dimensional gradient flows\nof analytic functionals. Thus, the question of uniqueness of blowups can be\napproached as an infinite dimensional version of Lojasiewicz's theorem. The\nquestion of uniqueness of blowups is perhaps the most fundamental question\nabout singularities.\n  This approach to uniqueness was pioneered by Leon Simon thirty years ago for\nthe area functional and many related functionals using an elaborate reduction\nto a finite dimensional setting where Lojasiewicz's arguments applied.\n  Recently, the authors proved two new infinite dimensional Lojasiewicz\ninequalities at noncompact singularities where it was well-known that a\nreduction to Lojasiewicz's arguments is not possible, but instead entirely new\ntechniques are required. As a consequence, the authors settled a major\nlong-standing open question about uniqueness of blowups for mean curvature flow\nat all generic singularities and for mean convex mean curvature flow at all\nsingularities. Using this, the authors have obtained a rather complete\ndescription of the space-time singular set for MCF with generic singularities.\nIn particular, the singular set of a MCF in $\\bf{R}^{n+1}$ with only generic\nsingularities is contained in finitely many compact Lipschitz submanifolds of\ndimension at most $n-1$ together with a set of dimension at most $n-2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 17:40:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 17:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 15:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-26"}

The first one is position-independent, with every lattice site having\nthe same coin at a given time, the second has time and position dependent\nrandomness, while the third one is time-independent. We show for several levels\nof disorder that dynamic disorder is the most powerful entanglement generator,\nfollowed closely by fluctuating disorder. Static disorder is the less efficient\nentangler, being almost always less efficient than the ordered case. Also,\ndynamic and fluctuating disorder lead to maximally entangled states\nasymptotically in time for any initial condition while static disorder has no\nasymptotic limit and, similarly to the ordered case, has a long time behavior\nhighly sensitive to the initial conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Feb 2014 18:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2014 21:37:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-11"}

The result is a zero adjustable parameter theory that can\nquantitatively address in a unified manner the alpha relaxation time over 14 or\nmore decades. The theory has no singularities above zero Kelvin, and relaxation\nin the equilibrium low temperature limit is predicted to be of a roughly\nArrhenius form. The two-barrier (local cage and long range collective elastic)\ndescription results in a rich dynamic behavior including apparent Arrhenius,\nnarrow crossover and deeply supercooled regimes, and multiple characteristic or\ncrossover times and temperatures of clear physical meaning. Application of the\ntheory to nonpolar molecules, alcohols, rare gases and liquids metals is\ncarried out. Overall, the agreement with experiment is quite good for the\ntemperature dependence of the alpha time, plateau shear modulus and Boson-like\npeak frequency for van der Waals liquids, though less so for hydrogen-bonding\nmolecules.

(2009), which captures learning tasks in which one type of error\nis costlier than others. A positive reliable classifier is one that makes no\nfalse positive errors. The goal in the positive reliable agnostic framework is\nto output a hypothesis with the following properties: (i) its false positive\nerror rate is at most $\\epsilon$, (ii) its false negative error rate is at most\n$\\epsilon$ more than that of the best positive reliable classifier from the\nclass. A closely related notion is fully reliable agnostic learning, which\nconsiders partial classifiers that are allowed to predict \"unknown\" on some\ninputs. The best fully reliable partial classifier is one that makes no errors\nand minimizes the probability of predicting \"unknown\", and the goal in fully\nreliable learning is to output a hypothesis that is almost as good as the best\nfully reliable partial classifier from a class.\n  For distribution-independent learning, the best known algorithms for PAC\nlearning typically utilize polynomial threshold representations, while the\nstate of the art agnostic learning algorithms use point-wise polynomial\napproximations. We show that one-sided polynomial approximations, an\nintermediate notion between polynomial threshold representations and point-wise\npolynomial approximations, suffice for learning in the reliable agnostic\nsettings. We then show that majorities can be fully reliably learned and\ndisjunctions of majorities can be positive reliably learned, through\nconstructions of appropriate one-sided polynomial approximations. Our fully\nreliable algorithm for majorities provides the first evidence that fully\nreliable learning may be strictly easier than agnostic learning.

A new quantum\nprogramming language QGCL is then proposed to support the paradigm of\nsuperposition of programs. This language can be seen as a quantum extension of\nDijkstra's GCL (Guarded Command Language). Surprisingly, alternation in GCL\nsplits into two different notions in the quantum setting: classical alternation\n(of quantum programs) and quantum alternation, with the latter being introduced\nin QGCL for the first time. Quantum alternation is the key program construct\nfor realizing the paradigm of superposition of programs.\n  The denotational semantics of QGCL are defined by introducing a new\nmathematical tool called the guarded composition of operator-valued functions.\nThen the weakest precondition semantics of QGCL can straightforwardly derived.\nAnother very useful program construct in realizing the quantum programming\nparadigm of superposition of programs, called quantum choice, can be easily\ndefined in terms of quantum alternation. The relation between quantum choices\nand probabilistic choices is clarified through defining the notion of local\nvariables. We derive a family of algebraic laws for QGCL programs that can be\nused in program verification, transformations and compilation. The expressive\npower of QGCL is illustrated by several examples where various variants and\ngeneralizations of quantum walks are conveniently expressed using quantum\nalternation and quantum choice.

Given this motivation,\nin this paper, we first propose the key requirements and challenges in\ndeveloping big data benchmarks from the perspectives of generating data with 4V\nproperties (i.e. volume, velocity, variety and veracity) of big data, as well\nas generating tests with comprehensive workloads for big data systems. We then\npresent the methodology on big data benchmarking designed to address these\nchallenges. Next, the state-of-the-art are summarized and compared, following\nby our vision for future research directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 03:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-24"}

A good backoff protocol should,\narguably, satisfy three natural properties: (i) it should provide constant\nthroughput, wasting as little time as possible; (ii) it should require few\nfailed access attempts, minimizing the amount of wasted effort; and (iii) it\nshould be robust, continuing to work efficiently even if some of the access\nattempts fail for spurious reasons. Unfortunately, exponential backoff has some\nwell-known limitations in two of these areas: it provides poor (sub-constant)\nthroughput (in the worst case), and is not robust (to resource acquisition\nfailures).\n  The goal of this paper is to \"fix\" exponential backoff by making it scalable,\nparticularly focusing on the case where processes arrive in an on-line,\nworst-case fashion. We present a relatively simple backoff\nprotocol~Re-Backoff~that has, at its heart, a version of exponential backoff.\nIt guarantees expected constant throughput with dynamic process arrivals and\nrequires only an expected polylogarithmic number of access attempts per\nprocess.\n  Re-Backoff is also robust to periods where the shared resource is unavailable\nfor a period of time. If it is unavailable for $D$ time slots, Re-Backoff\nprovides the following guarantees. When the number of packets is a finite $n$,\nthe average expected number of access attempts for successfully sending a\npacket is $O(\\log^2( n + D))$. In the infinite case, the average expected\nnumber of access attempts for successfully sending a packet is $O( \\log^2(\\eta)\n+ \\log^2(D) )$ where $\\eta$ is the maximum number of processes that are ever in\nthe system concurrently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 05:47:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jul 2014 14:51:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 06:09:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2015 06:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-14"}

Our\napproach avoids several of the largest sources of uncertainty in existing\ntechniques. By focusing on mid-IR wavelengths, we gain a virtually dust\nextinction-free tracer of the old stars, avoiding the need to adopt a dust\nmodel to correctly interpret optical or optical/NIR colors normally leveraged\nto assign M/L. By calibrating a new relation between NIR and mid-IR colors of\nGLIMPSE giant stars we also avoid discrepancies in model predictions for the\n[3.6]-[4.5] colors of old stellar populations due to uncertainties in molecular\nline opacities. We find that the [3.6]-[4.5] color, which is driven primarily\nby metallicity, provides a tight constraint on M/L_3.6, which varies\nintrinsically less than at optical wavelengths. The uncertainty on M/L_3.6 of\n~0.07 dex due to unconstrained age variations marks a significant improvement\non existing techniques for estimating the stellar M/L with shorter wavelength\ndata. A single M/L_3.6=0.6 (assuming a Chabrier IMF), independent of\n[3.6]-[4.5] color, is also feasible as it can be applied simultaneously to old,\nmetal-rich and young, metal-poor populations, and still with comparable (or\nbetter) accuracy (~0.1 dex) as alternatives.

Successive pattern changes are\nthus generated, which are regulated by successive combinations of feedback or\nfeedforward regulations under the upstream feedforward network that reads the\nmorphogen gradient. By using a pattern generated by the upstream feedforward\nnetwork as a boundary condition, downstream networks form later stripe\npatterns.

The latter requirement generally favors the use of\nhole-doped semiconductors. On the other hand, basic symmetry considerations\nimply that states from typical simple-metal superconductors will predominantly\ncouple to a semiconductor's conduction-band states and, therefore, in the first\ninstance generate a proximity effect for band electrons rather than holes. In\nthis article, we show how the superconducting correlations in the conduction\nband are transferred also to hole states in the valence band by virtue of\ninter-band coupling. A general theory of the superconducting proximity effect\nfor bulk and low-dimensional hole systems is presented. The interplay of\ninter-band coupling and quantum confinement is found to result in unusual\nwave-vector dependencies of the induced superconducting gap parameters.

Using ~130\nsight lines with 21-cm absorption measurements, we find that within the\nmeasurement uncertainty, the 21-cm detection rate in strong MgII systems is\nconstant over 0.5<z<1.5. Since stellar feedback processes are expected to\ndiminish the filling factor of CNM over 0.5<z<1, this lack of evolution in the\n21-cm detection rate in MgII absorbers is intriguing. Further, we find that if\nthe majority of 21-cm absorbers arise from DLAs then the cross-section of 21-cm\nabsorbing gas i.e. cold neutral medium amongst DLAs has increased from z=3.5 to\nz=0.5. In a sample of 13 z>2 DLAs with both 21-cm and H$_2$ (another tracer of\ncold gas) absorption measurements, we report two new H$_2$ detections and find\nthat in 8/13 cases neither 21-cm nor H$_2$ is detected. This confirms that the\nHI gas in z>2 DLAs is predominantly warm. Interestingly, there are two cases\nwhere 21-cm absorption is not detected despite the presence of H$_2$ with\nevidence for the presence of cold gas. This can be explained if H$_2$\ncomponents seen in DLA are compact (<15 pc) and contain <10% of the total\nN(HI).

The\nalgorithm preserves the conservation properties of the SPH formalism. In\nparticular, the total gas and dust mass, momentum, angular momentum and energy\nare all exactly conserved. Shock viscosity and conductivity terms are\ngeneralised to handle the two-phase mixture accordingly. The algorithm is\nbenchmarked against a comprehensive suit of problems: dustybox, dustywave,\ndustyshock and dustyoscill, each of them addressing different properties of the\nmethod. We compare the performance of the one-fluid algorithm to the standard\ntwo-fluid approach.

Implicit time stepping is straightforward. As a result, the\nalgorithm is up to ten billion times more efficient for 3D simulations of small\ngrains.

The bulk of the literature on anomalous response contains linear\nresponse functions like one by Cole-Cole calculated from such a CTRW theory and\napplied to thermal systems. Here we show within a fairly simple and general\nmodel that for the systems with divergent mean waiting times the stationary\nresponse is absent, in accordance with some recent studies. The absence of\nstationary response at thermal equilibrium (or dying to zero non-stationary\nresponse in aging experiments) would confirm CTRW with divergent mean waiting\ntimes as underlying physical relaxation mechanism, but reject it otherwise.

About half of the known sdB stars are found in close\nbinaries. Their short orbital periods of 1.2 h to a few days suggest that they\nare post common-envelope systems. Eclipsing hot subdwarf binaries are rare, but\nimportant to determine the fundamental stellar parameters. Low-mass companions\nare identified by the reflection effect. In most cases the companion is a main\nsequence star near the stellar mass limit. Here we report the discovery of an\neclipsing hot subdwarf binary SDSS J162256.66+473051.1 (J1622) of very short\norbital period (0.0697 d), found in the course of the MUCHFUSS project. The\nlightcurve shows grazing eclipses and a prominent reflection effect. An\nanalysis of the light- and radial velocity (RV) curves indicated a mass ratio\nof $q=$ 0.1325, an RV semiamplitude $K=47.2\\rm\\,km\\,s^{-1}$, and an inclination\nof $i=72.33^\\circ$. We show that a companion mass of 0.064 $M_{\\rm \\odot}$,\nwell below the hydrogen-burning limit, is the most plausible solution, which\nimplies a mass close to the canonical mass (0.47 $M_{\\rm \\odot}$) of the sdB\nstar. Therefore, the companion is a brown dwarf, which not only survived the\nengulfment by the red-giant envelope, but also triggered its ejection, and\nenabled the sdB star to form. The rotation of J1622 is expected to be tidally\nlocked to the orbit. However, J1622 rotates too slowly ($v_{\\rm rot}=74.5\\pm\n7\\rm\\,km\\,s^{-1}$) to be synchronized, challenging tidal interaction models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 11:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

In the former case, individuals imitate the strategy of a more\nsuccessful peer. In the latter case, individuals adjust their strategies based\non a comparison of their payoffs from the evolutionary game to a value they\naspire, called the level of aspiration. Unlike imitation processes of pairwise\ncomparison, aspiration-driven updates do not require additional information\nabout the strategic environment and can thus be interpreted as being more\nspontaneous. Recent work has mainly focused on understanding how aspiration\ndynamics alter the evolutionary outcome in structured populations. However, the\nbaseline case for understanding strategy selection is the well-mixed population\ncase, which is still lacking sufficient understanding. We explore how\naspiration-driven strategy-update dynamics under imperfect rationality\ninfluence the average abundance of a strategy in multi-player evolutionary\ngames with two strategies. We analytically derive a condition under which a\nstrategy is more abundant than the other in the weak selection limiting case.\nThis approach has a long standing history in evolutionary game and is mostly\napplied for its mathematical approachability. Hence, we also explore strong\nselection numerically, which shows that our weak selection condition is a\nrobust predictor of the average abundance of a strategy. The condition turns\nout to differ from that of a wide class of imitation dynamics, as long as the\ngame is not dyadic. Therefore a strategy favored under imitation dynamics can\nbe disfavored under aspiration dynamics. This does not require any population\nstructure thus highlights the intrinsic difference between imitation and\naspiration dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 12:14:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-06"}

Since such environments are more complex than those of isolated\ncores, it is essential to understand how the observed line profiles from\ncollapsing cores with non-spherical geometry are affected by filaments. In this\nstudy, we investigate line profile asymmetries by performing radiative transfer\ncalculations on hydrodynamic models of three collapsing cores that are embedded\nin filaments. We compare the results to those that are expected for isolated\ncores. We model the five lowest rotational transition line (J = 1-0, 2-1, 3-2,\n4-3, and 5-4) of both optically thick (HCN, HCO$^+$) as well as optically thin\n(N$_2$H$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$) molecules using constant abundance laws. We find\nthat less than 50% of simulated (1-0) transition lines show blue infall\nasymmetries due to obscuration by the surrounding filament. However, the\nfraction of collapsing cores that have a blue asymmetric emission line profile\nrises to 90% when observed in the (4-3) transition. Since the densest gas\ntowards the collapsing core can excite higher rotational states, upper level\ntransitions are more likely to produce blue asymmetric emission profiles. We\nconclude that even in irregular, embedded cores one can trace infalling gas\nmotions with blue asymmetric line profiles of optically thick lines by\nobserving higher transitions.

We attempt to determine\nthe characteristics of such faint disks around classical T Tauri stars, and to\nexplore the link between disk faintness and the proposed disk dispersal\nmechanisms (accretion, viscous spreading, photo-evaporation, planetary system\nformation). We performed high-angular resolution (0.3\") imaging of a small\nsample of disks (9 sources) with low 1.3mm continuum flux (mostly <30 mJy) with\nthe IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer and simultaneously searched for 13CO\n(or CO) J=2-1 line emission.

In\ncontinuum, half of the disks are very small, with characteristic radii less\nthan 10AU, but still have high surface density values. Small sizes appear to be\nthe main cause for the low disk luminosity. Direct evidence for grain growth is\nfound for the three disks that are sufficiently resolved.

Factor models capture population structure with latent variables called\nfactors, which can describe clustering of individuals into populations or\nisolation-by-distance patterns. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we both\ninfer population structure and identify outlier loci that are candidates for\nlocal adaptation. As outlier loci, the hierarchical factor model searches for\nloci that are atypically related to population structure as measured by the\nlatent factors.

Instead, the key\nproperty that permits efficient recovery in such problems is so-called local\nincoherence. Similarly, the standard notion of sparsity is also inadequate for\nmany real world problems. In particular, in many applications, the optimal\nsampling strategy depends on asymptotic incoherence and the signal sparsity\nstructure. The purpose of this paper is to study asymptotic incoherence and its\nimplications towards the design of optimal sampling strategies and efficient\nsparsity bases. It is determined how fast asymptotic incoherence can decay in\ngeneral for isometries. Furthermore it is shown that Fourier sampling and\nwavelet sparsity, whilst globally coherent, yield optimal asymptotic\nincoherence as a power law up to a constant factor. Sharp bounds on the\nasymptotic incoherence for Fourier sampling with polynomial bases are also\nprovided. A numerical experiment is also presented to demonstrate the role of\nasymptotic incoherence in finding good subsampling strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 15:36:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2015 22:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-09"}

The use of only magnetic fields to drive\nwall motion removes the possibility of mixing with current-related effects such\nas spin Hall effect or Rashba field, as well as the complexity arising from\nlithographic patterning. We demonstrate this method on sputtered Pt/Co/Ir/Pt\nmultilayers with a variable Ir layer thickness. By inserting an ultrathin layer\nof Ir at the Co/Pt interface we can reverse the sign of the effective DMI\nacting on the sandwiched Co layer, and therefore continuously change the domain\nwall (DW) structure from right- to the left-handed N\\'{e}el wall. We also show\nthat the DMI shows exquisite sensitivity to the exact details of the atomic\nstructure at the film interfaces by comparison with a symmetric epitaxial\nPt/Co/Pt multilayer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 09:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-25"}

Two notions have received particular attention: trophic groups, which\nhave been used for decades in the ecological literature, and more recently,\nmodules. The relationship between these two group definitions remains unknown\nin empirical food webs because they have so far been studied separately. While\nrecent developments in network theory have led to efficient methods for\ndetecting modules in food webs, the determination of trophic groups (sets of\nspecies that are functionally similar) is based on subjective expert knowledge.\nHere, we develop a novel algorithm for trophic group detection. We apply this\nmethod to several well-resolved empirical food webs, and show that aggregation\ninto trophic groups allows the simplification of food webs while preserving\ntheir information content. Furthermore, we reveal a 2-level hierarchical\nstructure where modules partition food webs into large bottom-top trophic\npathways whereas trophic groups further partition these pathways into sets of\nspecies with similar trophic connections. Bringing together trophic groups and\nmodules provides new perspectives to the study of dynamical and functional\nconsequences of food-web structure, bridging topological analysis and dynamical\nsystems. Trophic groups have a clear ecological meaning in terms of trophic\nsimilarity, and are found to provide a trade-off between network complexity and\ninformation loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 09:59:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2015 12:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}
