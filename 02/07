Here we report our\ncomparative study between the single-layer and double-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films\nby performing a systematic angle-resolved photoemission study on the samples\nannealed in vacuum.

The difference originates from the much reduced doping efficiency in\nthe bottom FeSe layer of the double-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 film from the FeSe-SrTiO3\ninterface.

Many GP maps share the following general properties: 1) The\nnumber of genotypes $N_G$ is much larger than the number of selectable\nphenotypes; 2) Neutral exploration changes the variation that is accessible to\nthe population; 3) The distribution of phenotype frequencies $F_p=N_p/N_G$,\nwith $N_p$ the number of genotypes mapping onto phenotype $p$, is highly\nbiased: the majority of genotypes map to only a small minority of the\nphenotypes. Here we explore how these properties affect the evolutionary\ndynamics of haploid Wright-Fisher models that are coupled to a simplified and\ngeneral random GP map or to a more complex RNA sequence to secondary structure\nmap. For both maps the probability of a mutation leading to a phenotype $p$\nscales to first order as $F_p$, although for the RNA map there are further\ncorrelations as well. By using mean-field theory, supported by computer\nsimulations, we show that the discovery time $T_p$ of a phenotype $p$ similarly\nscales to first order as $1/F_p$ for a wide range of population sizes and\nmutation rates in both the monomorphic and polymorphic regimes. These\ndifferences in the rate at which variation arises can vary over many orders of\nmagnitude. Phenotypic variation with a larger $F_p$ is therefore be much more\nlikely to arise than variation with a small $F_p$. We show, using the RNA\nmodel, that frequent phenotypes (with larger $F_p$) can fix in a population\neven when alternative, but less frequent, phenotypes with much higher fitness\nare potentially accessible. In other words, if the fittest never `arrive' on\nthe timescales of evolutionary change, then they can't fix. We call this highly\nnon-ergodic effect the `arrival of the frequent'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2014 17:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-07"}

In these methods the discretization in state space is avoided\nby using a max-plus basis expansion of the value function. This requires\nstoring only the coefficients of the basis functions used for representation.\nHowever, the number of basis functions grows exponentially with respect to the\nnumber of time steps of propagation to the time horizon of the control problem.\nThis so called \"curse of complexity\" can be managed by applying a pruning\nprocedure which selects the subset of basis functions that contribute most to\nthe approximation of the value function. The pruning procedures described thus\nfar in the literature rely on the solution of a sequence of high dimensional\noptimization problems which can become computationally expensive.\n  In this paper we show that if the max-plus basis functions are linear and the\nregion of interest in state space is convex, the pruning problem can be\nefficiently solved by the bundle method. This approach combining the bundle\nmethod and semidefinite formulations is applied to the quantum gate synthesis\nproblem, in which the state space is the special unitary group (which is\nnon-convex). This is based on the observation that the convexification of the\nunitary group leads to an exact relaxation.

We\nfind that nearly half of the late-type galaxies in dynamically \"old\" groups,\nthose with more than 25% of early-type members and redder UV-optical colours,\nhave also significantly lower dust-to-stellar mass ratios compared to those of\nactively star-forming galaxies of the same mass found both in HCGs and the\nfield. Examining their dust-to-gas mass ratios we conclude that dust was\nstripped out of these systems as a result of the gravitational and hydrodynamic\ninteractions, experienced due to previous encounters with other group members.\nAbout 40% of the early-type galaxies (mostly lenticulars), in dynamically \"old\"\ngroups, display dust properties similar to those of the UV-optical red\nlate-type galaxies.

We illustrate this\npoint using the minimal Higgs Inflationary scenario, which is arguably the most\npredictive single-field model on the market, because its predictions for $A_s$,\n$r$ and $n_s$ are made using only one new free parameter beyond those measured\nin particle physics experiments, and run up to the inflationary regime.

Furthermore, we demonstrate a principle of superposition for\nthe conductance and spatial current patterns in multiple-lead configurations.\nWe demonstrate that scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) can be employed to\nimage spatial current paths in GNR with atomic resolution, providing important\ninsight into the form of local charge transport. Finally, we investigate the\neffects of dephasing on the spatial current patterns, and show that with\ndecreasing dephasing time, the current patterns evolve smoothly from those of a\nballistic quantum network to those of classical resistor network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2014 21:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We show how to estimate\nthe motion according to the previous considerations in a variational framework,\nand in particular, show that these conditions lead to PDEs with boundary\nconditions at the interface that resemble Robin boundary conditions and induce\ncoupling between structures. We illustrate the use of this motion estimation\nscheme in propagating a segmentation across frames and show that it leads to\nmore accurate segmentation than traditional motion estimation that does not\nmake use of physical constraints. Further, the method is naturally suited to\ninteractive segmentation methods, which are prominently used in practice in\ncommercial applications for cardiac analysis, where typically a segmentation\nfrom the previous frame is used to predict a segmentation in the next frame.

We provide a class exact solutions on the boundary of the\nspace of physical configurations. This will show that all the other known exact\nsolutions are unphysical near the surface of the event horizon or in the\ninterior. This will have important consequences for the no-hair conjecture and\nthe kinds of persistent fields that can emerge from a black hole as well as the\nevolution during collisions and near grazing events. The interior of these\nholes are characterized by a limiting degenerate metric and these regions tend\nto well defined volumes and radii in contrast with what is inferred from\nsingular solutions. Surprisingly, these depend on past history and not simply\nthe mass or external fields of the body. It is shown that there is often a well\ndefined \"hidden\" flat background that can be used to equivalently reformulate\nGR in terms of a classical nonlinear gravity field and gives local conservation\nlaws. This has implications for unification efforts and numerical approaches to\nhandle the degenerate metric regions reminiscent of the Rankine-Hugoniot\nconditions.

In\nthese pulsars, a sharp increase in the emission is observed that then tends to\nsystematically drop-off from pulse-to-pulse.

While Nowakowski previously showed\nthat B0611+22 has mode-switching properties, the data presented here show, for\nthe first time, that this pulsar emits bursts with characteristic time-scales\nof several hundred seconds. At 327 MHz, the pulsar shows steady behaviour in\none emission mode which is enhanced by bursting emission slightly offset in\npulse phase from this steady emission. Contrastingly at 1400 MHz, the two modes\nappear to behave in a competing operation while still offset in phase. Using a\nfluctuation spectrum analysis, we also investigate each mode independently for\nsub-pulse drifting. Neither emission mode (i.e. during bursts or persistent\nemission) shows the presence of the drifting sub-pulse phenomenon. The bursting\nphenomena seen here appears to be a hybrid between bursting seen in other\npulsars and the bistable profile illumination behaviour reported in two other\npulsars by Rankin et al. Further examples of this cross-frequency behaviour are\nrequired, as this phenomenon may be quite common among the pulsar population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 04:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-10"}

We used ISAAC at VLT to obtain the spectra of the\ntargets. We compared them to those of mature and young BD, and young late-type\ncompanions to nearby stars with known ages, in order to identify and study\ngravity-sensitive features. We computed spectral indices weakly sensitive to\nthe surface gravity to derive near-infrared spectral types. Finally, we found\nthe best fit between each spectrum and synthetic spectra from the BT-Settl 2010\nand 2013 models. Using the best fit, we derived the atmospheric parameters of\nthe objects and identify which spectral characteristics the models do not\nreproduce.

Especially, time-global smoothing estimates\nfor the operator $a(D_x)$ with lower order terms are the benefit of our new\nmethod.

Both the Fe-SDW and Pr-TN temperatures decrease monotonically with Co\nsubstitution at Fe site. Superconductivity appears in a narrow range of x from\n0.07 to 0.25 with maximum Tc at 11.12 K for x = 0.15. Samples, with x = 0.25\nexhibit metallic behavior right from 300 K down to 2 K, without any Fe-SDW or\nPr-TN steps in resistivity. In fact, though Fe-SDW decreases monotonically, the\nPr-TN is disappeared even with x = 0.02. The magneto transport measurements\nbelow 14 Tesla on superconducting polycrystalline Co doped PrFeAsO lead to\nextrapolated values of the upper critical fields [Hc2(0)] of up to 60 Tesla.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 11:06:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 10:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In contrast to the common Fourier transform, these waves no longer have\nto be sinusoidal. Physically relevant waveforms are often available for the\nanalysis instead. The details of the transform depend on the waveforms\nunderlying the analysis, which in turn are specified through the implicit\nassumption that the signal is governed by a certain evolution equation. For\nexample, water waves generated by the Korteweg-de Vries equation can be\nexpressed in terms of cnoidal waves.

Nonlinear\nanalogs of classic problems such as spectral analysis and filtering arise in\nmany applications, with information transmission in optical fiber, as proposed\nby Yousefi and Kschischang, being a very recent one. The nonlinear Fourier\ntransform is eminently suited to address them -- at least from a theoretical\npoint of view. Although numerical algorithms are available for computing the\ntransform, a \"fast\" nonlinear Fourier transform that is similarly effective as\nthe fast Fourier transform is for computing the common Fourier transform has\nnot been available so far.

The underlying mechanism for the high e' is an internal barrier layer\ncapacitor (IBLC) structure of insulating grain boundaries (GB) and conducting\ngrain interiors (bulk). This behaviour is reviewed and discussed in detail. The\norigin of the IBLC structure is attributed to a small Cu non-stoichiometry in\nnominally insulating CaCu3Ti4O12, which varies between the GBs and bulk. Such\nnon-stoichiometry effects are studied in detail by analyzing bulk ceramics of\ndifferent composition within the ternary CaO-CuO-TiO2 phase diagram using X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and impedance\nspectroscopy (IS). At least two defect mechanisms are suggested to exist. It is\nfurther shown that the development of the defect mechanisms in CCTO and the\nconcomitant formation of the IBLC structure strongly depend on the processing\nconditions of CCTO ceramic pellets such as the sintering temperature. Nominally\nstoichiometric CCTO bulk ceramics sintered at different temperatures are\nanalyzed using XRD, SEM and IS. The performance of CCTO ceramics for IBLC\napplications is controlled by subtle modifications in the compound\nstoichiometry that is strongly dependent on the ceramic sintering temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 12:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-10"}

Our method uses\nelements of Schwarzschild's technique and of the made-to-measure method, but is\nbased on a different principle. Starting with some initial assignment of\nparticle velocities, we calculate their orbits using a flexible tree-based\nforce algorithm in the stationary potential of the target density distribution.\nThe difference of the time-averaged density response produced by these orbits\nwith respect to the initial density configuration is characterized through a\nmerit function, and a stationary solution of the collisionless Boltzmann\nequation is found by minimizing this merit function directly by iteratively\nadjusting the initial velocities. Because the distribution function is in\ngeneral not unique for a given density structure, we augment the merit function\nwith additional constraints that single out a desired target solution. We do\nthis for broad classes of axisymmetric density distributions by numerically\nsolving the Jeans equations to obtain the second velocity moments, which are\nthen imposed as further constraints in the optimization process. The velocity\nadjustment is carried out with a stochastic process in which new velocities are\nrandomly drawn from an approximate solution of the distribution function, but\nare kept only when they improve the fit. Our method converges rapidly and is\nflexible enough to allow the construction of solutions with third integrals of\nmotion, including disk galaxies with realistic velocity distributions.

The leading assumption of this paper is that\ninformation which can be distilled from public debates on Twitter has\npredictive content for exchange rate movements. This assumption prompted a\nTwitter-based exchange rate model that harnesses regARIMA analyses for\nshort-term out-of-sample ex post forecasts of the daily closing prices of\nEUR/USD spot exchange rates. The analyses used Tweet counts collected from\nJanuary 1, 2012 - September 27, 2013. To identify concepts mentioned on Twitter\nwith a predictive potential the analysis followed a 2-step selection. Firstly,\na heuristic qualitative analysis assembled a long list of 594 concepts, e.g.,\nMerkel, Greece, Cyprus, crisis, chaos, growth, unemployment expected to covary\nwith the ups and downs of the EUR/USD exchange rate. Secondly, cross-validation\nusing window averaging with a fixed-sized rolling origin was deployed to select\nconcepts and corresponding univariate time series that had error scores below\nchance level as defined by the random walk model. With regard to a short list\nof 17 concepts (covariates), in particular SP (Standard & Poor's) and risk, the\nout-of-sample predictive accuracy of the Twitter-based regARIMA model was found\nto be repeatedly better than that obtained from both the random walk model and\na random noise covariate in 1-step ahead forecasts of the EUR/USD exchange\nrate. This advantage was evident on the level of forecast error metrics (MSFE,\nMAE) when a majority vote over different estimation windows was conducted.

It is common sense that vehicular traffic arranges\nin a user-equilibrium based on generalized costs in which travel time is a\nmajor factor. Surprisingly travel time has not received much attention for the\nroute choice of pedestrians. In microscopic simulations of pedestrians the\nvastly dominating paradigm for the computation of the preferred walking\ndirection is set into the direction of the (spatially) shortest path. For\nsituations where pedestrians have travel time as primary determinant for their\nwalking behavior it would be desirable to also have an assignment method in\npedestrian simulations. To apply existing (road traffic) assignment methods\nwith simulations of pedestrians one has to reduce the nondenumerably many\npossible pedestrian trajectories to a small subset of routes which represent\nthe main, relevant, and significantly distinguished routing alternatives. All\nexcept one of these routes will mark detours, i.e. not the shortest connection\nbetween origin and destination. The proposed assignment method is intended to\nwork with common operational models of pedestrian dynamics. These - as\nmentioned before - usually send pedestrians into the direction of the spatially\nshortest path. Thus, all detouring routes have to be equipped with intermediate\ndestinations, such that pedestrians can do a detour as a piecewise connection\nof segments on which they walk into the direction of the shortest path. One has\nthen to take care that the transgression from one segment to the following one\nno artifacts are introduced into the pedestrian trajectory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 14:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-10"}

In the first scenario, multifractality survives\nbelow a certain scale of the quantum fluctuations. In the other one, the\nfluctuations of the wave functions are changed at every scale and each\nmultifractal dimension smoothly goes to the ergodic value. We use as generic\nexamples a one-dimensional dynamical system and the three-dimensional Anderson\nmodel at the metal-insulator transition. Based on our results, we conjecture\nthat the sensitivity of quantum multifractality to perturbation is universal in\nthe sense that it follows one of these two scenarios depending on the\nperturbation. We also discuss the experimental implications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 14:59:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 14:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-16"}

Geochemical data provide critical information on the timing of\naccretion and the prevailing physical conditions, but their interpretation\ndepends critically on the degree of metal-silicate chemical equilibration\nduring core-mantle differentiation, which is poorly constrained. Efficient\nequilibration requires that the large volumes of iron derived from impactor\ncores mix with molten silicates down to scales small enough to allow fast\nmetal-silicate mass transfer. Here we use fluid dynamics experiments to show\nthat large metal blobs falling in a magma ocean mix with the molten silicate\nthrough turbulent entrainment, with fragmentation into droplets eventually\nresulting from the entrainment process. In our experiments, fragmentation of\nthe dense fluid occurs after falling a distance equal to 3-4 times its initial\ndiameter, at which point a sizable volume of ambient fluid has already been\nentrained and mixed with the dense falling fluid. Contrary to what has usually\nbeen assumed, we demonstrate that fragmentation of the metallic phase into\ndroplets may not be required for efficient equilibration: turbulent mixing, by\ndrastically increasing the metal-silicate interfacial area, may result in fast\nequilibration even before fragmentation. Efficient re-equilibration is\npredicted for impactors of size small compared to the magma ocean depth. In\ncontrast, a much smaller re-equilibration degree is predicted in the case of\nlarge impacts for which the impactor core diameter approaches the magma ocean\nthickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 15:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

We focus on Union2 and\nSNLS3 SNIa datasets and use the hemispherical comparison method to detect\npossible anisotropic features. Unlike some previous works where non-diagonal\nelements of the covariance matrix were neglected, we use the full covariance\nmatrix of the SNIa data, thus obtaining more realistic and not underestimated\nerrors. As a matter of fact, the significance of previously claimed detections\nof a preferred direction in the Union2 dataset completely disappears once we\ninclude the effects of using the full covariance matrix. Moreover, we also find\nthat such a a preferred direction is aligned with the orthogonal direction of\nthe SDSS observational plane and this suggests a clear indication that the SDSS\nsubsample of the Union2 dataset introduces a significant biased, making the\ndetected preferred direction unphysical. We thus find that current SNIa surveys\nare inappropriate to test anisotropic features due to their highly\nnon-homogeneous angular distribution in the sky. In addition, after removal of\nthe highest inhomogeneous sub-samples, the number of SNIa is too low. Finally,\nwe take advantage of the particular distribution of SNLS SNIa sub-sample in the\nSNLS3 data set, in which the observations were taken along 4 different\ndirections. We fit each direction independently and find consistent results at\nthe 1$\\sigma$ level. Although the likelihoods peak at relatively different\nvalues of $\\Omega_m$,the low number of data along each direction gives rise to\nlarge errors so that the likelihoods are sufficiently broad as to overlap\nwithin 1$\\sigma$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 12:18:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 15:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-28"}

The exterior and interior geometries can correspond to\ndifferent vacuum states of the same theory. In the region outside the sphere,\nthe contributions in the VEVs, induced by the interior geometry, are explicitly\nseparated. For the special case of the Minkowskian exterior geometry, the\nasymptotics of the VEVs near the boundary and at large distances are discussed\nin detail. In particular, it has been shown that the divergences on the\nboundary are weaker than in the problem of a spherical boundary in Minkowski\nspacetime with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. As an application of\ngeneral results, dS and AdS spaces are considered as examples of the interior\ngeometry. For AdS interior there are no bound states. In the case of dS\ngeometry and for nonminimally coupled fields, bound states appear for a radius\nof the separating boundary sufficiently close to the dS horizon. Starting from\na critical value of the radius the Minkowskian vacuum in the exterior region\nbecomes unstable.
