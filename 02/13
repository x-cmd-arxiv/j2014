Amongst many ways to achieve this, single-photon probes\ncan be used in a method called quantum process tomography (QPT). Furthermore,\nQPT is an essential method in determining how a process acts on quantum\nmechanical states. For example for quantum technology, QPT is used to\ncharacterise multi-qubit processors and quantum communication channels; across\nquantum physics QPT of some form is often the first experimental investigation\nof a new physical process, as shown in the recent research into coherent\ntransport in biological mechanisms. However, the precision of QPT is limited by\nthe fact that measurements with single-particle probes are subject to\nunavoidable shot noise---this holds for both single photon and laser probes. In\nsituations where measurement resources are limited, for example, where the\nprocess is rapidly changing or the time bandwidth is constrained, it becomes\nessential to overcome this precision limit. Here we devise and demonstrate a\nscheme for tomography which exploits non-classical input states and quantum\ninterferences; unlike previous QPT methods our scheme capitalises upon the\npossibility to use simultaneously multiple photons per mode. The\nefficiency---quantified by precision per photon used---scales with larger\nphoton number input states. Our demonstration uses four-photon states and our\nresults show a substantial reduction of statistical fluctuations compared to\ntraditional QPT methods---in the ideal case one four-photon probe state yields\nthe same amount of statistical information as twelve single probe photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2014 16:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-26"}

The method is adjusted such that its continuum limit is the\nNavier-Stokes equation, with a driving force derived from the Cahn-Hilliard\nfree energy. In contrast to previous work, however, the bulk and interface\nterms are decoupled, the former being incorporated into the model through the\nlocal equilibrium populations, and the latter through a forcing term. We focus\non gas-liquid phase equilibria with the possibility to implement an arbitrary\nequation of state. The most novel aspect of our approach is a systematic\nChapman-Enskog expansion up to the third order. Due to the third-order gradient\nin the interface forcing term, this is needed for full consistency with both\nhydrodynamics and thermodynamics. Our construction of a model that satisfies\nall conditions is based upon previous work by Chen, Goldhirsch, and Orszag (J.\nSci. Comp. 34, 87 (2008)), and implies 59 and 21 velocities in three and two\ndimensions, respectively. Applying the conditions of positivity of weights,\nexistence of a two-phase region in the phase diagram, and positivity of the\nbulk viscosity, we find substantial restrictions on the permitted equation of\nstate, which can only be lifted by an even more refined model. Moreover, it\nturns out that it is necessary to solve a self-consistent equation for the\nhydrodynamic flow velocity, in order to enforce the identity of momentum\ndensity and mass current on the lattice. The analysis completely identifies all\nspurious terms in the Navier-Stokes equation, and thus shows how to\nsystematically eliminate each of them, by constructing a suitable collision\noperator.

The thermal\nproperties of the disk are calculated self-consistently by balancing radiative\ncooling through the surfaces of the disk with heating due to dissipation of\nturbulence driven by magneto-rotational instability (MRI). As has been noted in\nprevious work, we find the dissipation rate per unit mass increases\ndramatically with height above the mid-plane, in stark contrast to the\nalpha-disk model which assumes this quantity is a constant. Thus, we find that\nin simulations with a low surface density (and therefore a shallow\nphotosphere), the fraction of energy dissipated above the photosphere is\nsignificant (about 3.4% in our lowest surface density model), and this fraction\nincreases as surface density decreases. When a significant fraction of the\naccretion energy is dissipated in the optically thin photosphere, the gas\ntemperature increases substantially and a high temperature, magnetic pressure\nsupported corona is formed. The volume-averaged temperature in the disk corona\nis more than 10 times larger than at the disk mid-plane. Moreover, gas\ntemperature in the corona is strongly anti-correlated with gas density, which\nimplies the corona formed by MRI turbulence is patchy. This mechanism to form\nan accretion disk corona may help explain the observed relation between the\nspectral index and luminosity from AGNs, and the soft X-ray excess from some\nAGNs. It may also be relevant to spectral state changes in X-ray binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2014 21:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Effective characterization and recognition theorems\nfor these 3-manifolds as well as theoretical generalizations of these results\nto higher dimensions are established. The methods developed build a bridge\nlinking geometric topology with iterated function systems and their attractors.\n  A method to model self-affine tiles by simple iterative systems is developed\nin order to study their topology. The model is functorial in the sense that\nthere is an easily computable map that induces isomorphisms between the natural\nsubdivisions of the attractor of the model and the self-affine tile. It has\nmany beneficial qualities including ease of computation allowing one to\ndetermine topological properties of the attractor of the model such as\nconnectedness and whether it is a manifold.

Here, we consider the problem of transmission enhancement using\nphase-only modulated wavefronts. We develop physically realizable iterative and\nnon-iterative algorithms for increasing the transmission through such random\nmedia using backscatter analysis. We theoretically show that, despite the\nphase-only modulation constraint, the non-iterative algorithms will achieve at\nleast about 25$\\pi$% or about 78.5% transmission assuming there is at least one\nperfectly transmitting eigen-wavefront and that the singular vectors of the\ntransmission matrix obey a maximum entropy principle so that they are\nisotropically random.\n  We numerically analyze the limits of phase-only modulated transmission in 2-D\nwith fully spectrally accurate simulators and provide rigorous numerical\nevidence confirming our theoretical prediction in random media with periodic\nboundary conditions that is composed of hundreds of thousands of non-absorbing\nscatterers.

The flux rope stays in\nstable equilibrium states initially and evolves quasi-statically. Upon the loss\nof equilibrium point is reached, the flux rope cannot sustain the stable\nequilibrium states and erupts catastrophically. During the process, the\nmagnetic energy stored in the magnetosphere is rapidly released as the result\nof destabilization of global magnetic topology. The magnetospheric energy that\ncould be accumulated is of vital importance for the outbursts of magnetars. We\ncarefully establish the fully open fields and partially open fields for various\nboundary conditions at the magnetar surface and study the relevant energy\nthresholds. By investigating the magnetic energy accumulated at the critical\ncatastrophic point, we find that it is possible to drive fully open eruptions\nfor dipole dominated background fields.

Given the\nobservational importance of the multipolar magnetic fields in the vicinity of\nthe magnetar surface, it would be worthwhile to explore the possibility of the\nalternative eruption approach in multipolar background fields. Fortunately, we\nfind that flux ropes may give rise to partially open eruptions in the\nmultipolar fields, which involve only partial opening up of background fields.\nThe energy release fractions are greater for cases with central-arcaded\nmultipoles than those with central-caved multipoles emerged in background\nfields.

The\nevent-driven models based on the concept of threshold can explain many features\nof the experimentally observed dynamics. However, much still remains unclear\nabout the dynamics of human-controlled systems, which likely indicates that\nhumans employ more intricate control mechanisms. The present paper argues that\ncontrol activation in humans may be not threshold-driven, but instead\nintrinsically stochastic, noise-driven. Specifically, we suggest that control\nactivation stems from stochastic interplay between the operator's need to keep\nthe controlled system near the goal state on one hand and the tendency to\npostpone interrupting the system dynamics on the other hand. We propose a model\ncapturing this interplay and show that it matches the experimental data on\nhuman balancing of virtual overdamped stick.

In this paper, the magnetohydrostatic configuration of isothermal gas\nis studied, in which the thermal pressure and the Lorentz force are balanced\nagainst the self-gravity and the magnetic field is globally perpendicular to\nthe axis of the filament. The model is controlled by three parameters:\ncenter-to-surface density ratio (\\rho_c/\\rho_s), plasma \\beta of surrounding\ninterstellar gas (\\beta_0) and the radius of the hypothetical parent cloud\nnormalized by the scale-height (R'_0), although there remains a freedom how the\nmass is distributed against the magnetic flux (mass loading). In the case that\nR'_0 is small enough, the magnetic field plays a role in confining the gas.\nHowever, the magnetic field generally has an effect in supporting the cloud.\nThere is a maximum line-mass (mass per unit length) above which the cloud is\nnot supported against the gravity. Compared with the maximum line-mass of\nnon-magnetized cloud (2c_s^2/G, where c_s and G represent respectively the\nisothermal sound speed and the gravitational constant), that of the magnetized\nfilament is larger than the non-magnetized one.

This\nregularisation, which was proposed based on experimental observations, smooths\nthe effect of a sudden jump in the contact pressure over a characteristic\nlength scale. We apply it in numerical simulations in order to analyse its\ninfluence on the behaviour of local slip. We first show that mesh convergence\nin dynamic simulations is achieved without any numerical damping in the bulk\nand draw a convergence map with respect to the characteristic length of the\nfriction regularisation. By varying this length scale on the example of a given\nslip event, we observe that there is a critical length below which the friction\nregularisation does not affect anymore the propagation of the interface\nrupture. A spectral analysis of the regularisation on a periodic variation of\nCoulomb's friction is conducted to confirm the existence of this critical\nlength. The results indicate that if the characteristic length of the friction\nregularisation is smaller than the critical length, a slip event behaves as if\nit was governed by Coulomb's law. We therefore propose that there is a domain\nof influence of the friction regularisation depending on its characteristic\nlength and on the frequency content of the local slip event. A byproduct of the\nanalysis is related to the existence of a physical length scale characterising\na given frictional interface. We establish that the experimental determination\nof this interface property may be achieved by experimentally monitoring slip\npulses whose frequency content is rich enough.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 07:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-14"}

When a node pair is\nsampled, the observed outcome is a binary random variable, equal to 1 if nodes\ninteract and to 0 otherwise. The outcome is more likely to be positive if nodes\nbelong to the same communities. For a given budget of node pair samples or\nobservations, we wish to jointly design a sampling strategy (the sequence of\nsampled node pairs) and a clustering algorithm that recover the hidden\ncommunities with the highest possible accuracy. We consider both non-adaptive\nand adaptive sampling strategies, and for both classes of strategies, we derive\nfundamental performance limits satisfied by any sampling and clustering\nalgorithm. In particular, we provide necessary conditions for the existence of\nalgorithms recovering the communities accurately as the network size grows\nlarge.

Such signals have many\nobvious scientific and technological applications, yet their practical use is\nstrongly limited by the fact that an overwhelming proportion of the energy goes\ninto that part of the signal, which is not superoscillating. In a recent\narticle the problem of optimization of such signals has been studied. In that\narticle the concept of superoscillation yield is defined as the ratio of the\nenergy in the super oscillations to the total energy of the signal, given the\nrange in time and frequency of the superoscillations, which is imposed by\nforcing the signal to interpolate among a set of predetermined points. The\noptimization of the superoscillation yield consists of obtaining the Fourier\ncoefficients of the low frequency components of which the signal consists, that\nmaximize the yield under the interpolation constraint. Since in practical\napplications it is impossible to determine the Fourier coefficients with\ninfinite precision, it is necessary to answer two questions. The first is how\nis the superoscillating nature of the signal affected by random small\ndeviations in those Fourier coefficients and the second is how is the yield\naffected? These are the questions addressed in the present article. Limits on\nthe necessary precision are obtained. Those limits seem not to be impractical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 11:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-18"}

The\nunderlying assumption of the employed evaporation/condensation model is that\nphase change occurs in thermal non-equilibrium and that the associated\ntimescale is larger than that of the wave dynamics. Results for the collapse of\na spherical vapor bubble close to a solid wall are discussed for three\ndifferent bubble-wall configurations. The major challenge for such numerical\ninvestigations is to accurately reproduce the dynamics of the interface between\nliquid and vapor during the entire collapse process, including the high-speed\ndynamics of the late stages, where compressibility of both phases plays a\ndecisive role.\n  Direct interface resolving simulations are intractable for real world\ntechnical applications such as turbulent flows involving cavitation clouds with\nmillions of vapor bubbles and a wide range of time and length scales. For this\nreason, we developed a coarse grained model for large-eddy simulation (LES) of\nturbulent two-phase flows with cavitation. In LES, vapor bubbles constitute\nsub-grid scales that have to be modeled accordingly. On the grid scale, we\nsolve the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for a homogeneous mixture of\nliquid and vapor. For deriving an appropriate equation of state, we assume that\nthe characteristic time scale of phase change is much smaller than the\nnumerical time step and that phase change is isentropic and in mechanical\nequilibrium at the saturation pressure.

This allows us to derive the maximal duration of each quantum error\ncorrection period by studying when the single-qubit error rate reaches the\ncorresponding threshold. At the time when error correction breaks down, the\nerror rate in the code can be dominated by the direct coupling of each qubit to\nthe bath, by mediated subluminal interactions, or by mediated superluminal\ninteractions. For a 2D Ohmic bath, the time available per quantum error\ncorrection period vanishes in the thermodynamic limit of a large code size $L$\ndue to induced superluminal interactions, though it does so only like\n$1/\\sqrt{\\log L}$. For all other bath types considered, this time remains\nfinite as $L\\rightarrow\\infty$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 12:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-07"}

The excited wave\npacket consists of the $^1S$, $^1P$, and $^1D$ states, including the background\ncontinua, near the $2s2p(^1P)$ doubly excited state. The resultant electron\nspectra with various laser intensities and time delays between the EUV and\nlaser pulses are obtained by a multilevel model and an ab initio time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation calculation. By taking the ab initio calculation as a\n\"virtual measurement\", the dipole-forbidden resonances are characterized by the\nmultilevel model. We found that in contrast to the common assumption, the\nnonresonant coupling between the continua plays a significant role in the\ntime-delayed electron spectra, which shows the correlation effect between\nphotoelectrons before they leave the core. This technique takes the advantages\nof ultrashort pulses uniquely and would be a timely test for the current\nattosecond technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 13:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 14:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-28"}

We approximate the stream as a\nseries of discrete massive particles ejected in the ballistic limit at the\ninner Lagrangian point of the donor toward the accretor. This work improves\nupon similar earlier studies in a number of ways. First, we self-consistently\ncalculate the total angular momentum of the orbit at all times. This includes\nchanges in the orbital angular momentum during the ballistic trajectory of the\nejected mass, as well as changes during the ejection/accretion due to the\nradial component of the particle's velocity. Second, we calculate the\nparticle's ballistic trajectory for each system, which allows us to determine\nthe precise position and velocity of the particle upon accretion. We can then\ninclude specific information about the radius of the accretor as well as the\nangle of impact. Finally, we ensure that the total angular momentum is\nconserved, which requires the donor star spin to vary self-consistently. We\ncalculate the angular momentum change of the orbit and each binary component\nacross the entire parameter space of direct impact double white dwarf binaries.\nWe find a significant decrease in the amount of angular momentum removed from\nthe orbit during mass transfer, as well as cases where this process increases\nthe angular momentum of the orbit at the expense of the spin angular momentum\nof the donor. We conclude that, unlike earlier claims in the literature, mass\ntransfer through direct impact need not destabilize the binary and that the\nquantity and sign of the orbital angular momentum transfer depends on the\nbinary properties. This stabilization may significantly impact the population\nsynthesis calculations of double white dwarf progenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 14:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

AGB models predict, for example, large\noverabundances of lead (Pb) compared to other s-process elements in metal-poor\nlow-mass AGB stars. This is indeed observed in some extrinsically enhanced\nmetal-poor stars, but not in all. An extensive study of intrinsically s-process\nenriched objects is essential for improving our knowledge of the AGB third\ndredge-up and associated s-process nucleosynthesis. Aims: We compare the\nspectral abundance analysis of the SMC post-AGB star J004441.04-732136.4 with\nstate-of-the-art AGB model predictions with a main focus on Pb. The low S/N in\nthe Pb line region made the result of our previous study inconclusive. We\nacquired additional data covering the region of the strongest Pb line. Methods:\nBy carefully complementing re-reduced previous data, with newly acquired UVES\noptical spectra, we improve the S/N of the spectrum around the strongest Pb\nline. Therefore, an upper limit for the Pb abundance is estimated from a merged\nweighted mean spectrum using synthetic spectral modeling. We then compare the\nabundance results from the combined spectra to predictions of tailored AGB\nevolutionary models from two independent evolution codes. In addition, we\ndetermine upper limits for Pb abundances for three previously studied LMC\npost-AGB objects. Results: Although theoretical predictions for\nJ004441.04-732136.4 match the s-process distribution up to tungsten (W), the\npredicted very high Pb abundance is clearly not detected.

This conclusion is robust against the use\nof different alpha factor values, and/or different warm gas tracers (H_2 vs.\nH_2 plus CO): with the CO-probed gas mass being at least 40 times lower at 400K\nthan at 25K, the total warm-to-cold mass ratio is always lower in the ambient\ngas than in the entrained gas. Heating of the molecular gas could facilitate\nthe detection of new outflows in distant galaxies by enhancing their emission\nin intermediate rotational number CO lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 15:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

Our main theorem assumes a weak limit theorem on the\nnoise process appearing in the random recursions and lifts it to diffusion\napproximation for the recursion itself. To achieve this, we approximate the\nrecursion (pathwise) by the solution to a stochastic equation driven by\npiecewise smooth paths; this can be thought of as a pathwise version of\nbackward error analysis for SDEs. We then identify the limit of this stochastic\nequation, and hence the original recursion, using tools from rough path theory.\nWe provide several examples of diffusion approximations, both new and old, to\nillustrate this technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 15:48:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 07:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

The\nfirst reason is that the superoscillation frequency can be exploited to perform\ntasks beyond the limits imposed by the lower bandwidth of the signal. The\nsecond reason is that it is generic and applies to any wave form, be it\noptical, electrical, sonic, or quantum mechanical. For practical applications,\nit is important to overcome two problems. The first problem is that an\noverwhelming proportion of the energy goes into the non superoscillating part\nof the signal. The second problem is the control of the shape of the\nsuperoscillating part of the signal. The first problem has been recently\naddressed by optimization of the super oscillation yield, the ratio of the\nenergy in the superoscillations to the total energy of the signal. The second\nproblem may arise when the superoscillation, is to mimic a high frequency\npurely perodic signal. This may be required, for example, when a\nsuperoscillating force is to drive a harmonic oscillator at a high resonance\nfrequency.
