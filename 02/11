But all the proposed virtual\nbackbone trees are not fully energy efficient and EVBTs have few flaws\nassociated with them.

The energy consumption is\nmost minimal and optimal and it is shown why it always has minimal energy\nconsumption during any transfer of packet between every node with the sink\nnode. For every node, route path with most minimal energy consumption is\nidentified and a new tree node is elected only when a better minimal energy\nconsumption route is identified for a node to communicate with the sink and\nvice versa. By moving sink periodically it is ensured the battery of the nodes\nnear sink is not completely drained out. Another backbone construction\nalgorithm is proposed which maximises the network lifetime by increasing the\nlifetime of all tree nodes.

We present a study of the mobility\nand reactivity of O atoms on an amorphous silicate surface. Our results are in\nthe form of RAIRS and temperature-programmed desorption spectra of O2 and O3\nproduced via two pathways: O + O and O2 + O, investigated in a submonolayer\nregime and in the range of temperature between 6.5 and 30 K. All the\nexperiments show that ozone is formed efficiently on silicate at any surface\ntemperature between 6.5 and 30 K. The derived upper limit for the activation\nbarriers of O + O and O2 + O reactions is 150 K/kb. Ozone formation at low\ntemperatures indicates that fast diffusion of O atoms is at play even at 6.5 K.\nThrough a series of rate equations included in our model, we also address the\nreaction mechanisms and show that neither the Eley Rideal nor the Hot atom\nmechanisms alone can explain the experimental values. The rate of diffusion of\nO atoms, based on modeling results, is much higher than the one generally\nexpected, and the diffusive process proceeds via the Langmuir-Hinshelwood\nmechanism enhanced by tunnelling. In fact, quantum effects turn out to be a key\nfactor that cannot be neglected in our simulations. Astrophysically, efficient\nO3 formation on interstellar dust grains would imply the presence of huge\nreservoirs of oxygen atoms. Since O3 is a reservoir of elementary oxygen, and\nalso of OH via its hydrogenation, it could explain the observed concomitance of\nCO2 and H2O in the ices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2014 17:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-11"}

The classic use of serializable\ntransactions is sufficient to maintain correctness but is not necessary for all\napplications, sacrificing potential scalability. In this paper, we develop a\nformal framework, invariant confluence, that determines whether an application\nrequires coordination for correct execution. By operating on application-level\ninvariants over database states (e.g., integrity constraints), invariant\nconfluence analysis provides a necessary and sufficient condition for safe,\ncoordination-free execution. When programmers specify their application\ninvariants, this analysis allows databases to coordinate only when anomalies\nthat might violate invariants are possible. We analyze the invariant confluence\nof common invariants and operations from real-world database systems (i.e.,\nintegrity constraints) and applications and show that many are invariant\nconfluent and therefore achievable without coordination.

Using magnetised partially ionised\nhydrogen atmosphere models in X-ray spectral fits we found that the thermal\ncomponent can come from entire surface of the cooling neutron star with a\ntemperature of 36$^{+9}_{-6}$ eV, making it one of the coldest among cooling\nneutron stars known.

This combination of colours\n(UVJ) provides an efficient means of separating quiescent from star-forming,\nincluding dust reddened, galaxies. Morphological information emphasises\ndifferences between AGN split by their UVJ colours. AGN in quiescent galaxies\nare dominated by spheroids, while star-forming hosts are split between bulges\nand disks. The UVJ diagram of AGN hosts is then used to set limits on the\naccretion density associated with evolved and star-forming systems. Most of the\nblack hole growth since z~1 is associated with star-forming hosts.\nNevertheless, ~15-20% of the X-ray luminosity density since z~1, is taking\nplace in the quiescent region of the UVJ diagram. For the z~0.40 subsample,\nthere is tentative evidence (2sigma significance), that AGN split by their UVJ\ncolours differ in Eddington ratio. AGN in star-forming hosts dominate at high\nEddington ratios, while AGN in quiescent hosts become increasingly important as\na fraction of the total population toward low Eddington ratios. At higher\nredshift, z~0.8, such differences are significant at the 2sigma level only at\nEddington ratios >1e-3. These findings are consistent with scenarios in which\ndiverse accretion modes are responsible for the build-up of SMBHs at the\ncentres of galaxies. We compare our results with the GALFORM semi-analytic\nmodel, which postulates two black hole fuelling modes, the first linked to\nstar-formation and the second occuring in passive galaxies. GALFORM predicts a\nlarger fraction of black hole growth in quiescent galaxies at z<1, compared to\nthe data.

We run the radiative transfer code TRADING to follow the transfer of\nradiation from the central source and from stellar sources through the dusty\nenvironment of the host galaxy. The model is based on the output of the\nsemi-analytical merger tree code, GAMETE/QSOdust, which enables to predict the\nevolution of the host galaxy and of its nuclear black hole, following the star\nformation history and chemical evolution -- including dust -- in all the\nprogenitor galaxies of SDSS J1148+5251. We find that the radiation emitted by\nthe central source can also provide an important source of heating for the dust\ndistributed in the host galaxy, powering at least 30% and up to 70% of the\nobserved far infrared emission at rest-frame wavelengths [20 - 1000]micron. The\nremaining fraction is contributed by stellar sources and can only be achieved\nif the host galaxy is able to sustain a star formation rate of ~ 900 Msun/yr at\nz=6.4. This points to a co-evolution scenario where, during their hierarchical\nassembly, the first SMBHs and their host galaxies first grow at the same pace\nuntil the black hole reaches a mass of ~ 2 10^8 Msun and starts growing faster\nthan its host, reaching the bright quasar phase when the black hole and stellar\nmass fall within the scatter of the scaling relation observed in local\ngalaxies.

This mediator particle may\nbe produced on shell, so that direct searches for the mediating particle can\nconstrain the effective operator being applied to monojet constraints. In this\nfirst paper, we do a case study on t-channel models in monojet searches, where\nthe (Standard Model singlet) DM is pair produced via a t-channel mediating\nparticle, whose supersymmetric analogue is the squark. We compare monojet\nconstraints to direct constraints on single or pair production of the mediator\nfrom multi-jets plus missing energy searches and we identify the regions where\nthe latter dominate over the former. We show that computing bounds using\nsupersymmetric simplified models and in the narrow width approximation, as done\nin previous work in the literature, misses important quantitative effects. We\nperform a full event simulation and statistical analysis, and we compute the\neffects of both on- and off-shell production of the mediating particle, showing\nthat for both the monojet and multi-jets plus missing energy searches,\npreviously derived bounds provided more conservative bounds than what can be\nextracted by including all relevant processes in the simulation. Monojets and\nsearches for supersymmetry (SUSY) provide comparable bounds on a wide range of\nthe parameter space, with SUSY searches usually providing stronger bounds,\nexcept in the regions where the DM particle and the mediator are very mass\ndegenerate.

This corresponds to a sudden\nchange of the geometry of the chain or, in the equivalent language of\ninteracting fermions confined in a box trap, to a sudden increase of the trap\nsize. The entanglement dynamics after the quench is associated with the\nballistic propagation of a magnetization wavefront. At the free fermion point\n(XX chain), the von-Neumann entropy S_A exhibits several intriguing dynamical\nregimes. Specifically, at short times a logarithmic increase is observed,\nsimilar to local quenches. This is accurately described by an analytic formula\nthat we derive from heuristic arguments. At intermediate times partial revivals\nof the short-time dynamics are superposed with a power-law increase S_A\nt^\\alpha, with \\alpha<1. Finally, at very long times a steady state develops\nwith constant entanglement entropy. As expected, since the model is integrable,\nwe find that the steady state is non thermal, although it exhibits extensive\nentanglement entropy. We also investigate the entanglement dynamics after the\nquench from a finite to the infinite chain (sudden expansion). While at long\ntimes the entanglement vanishes, we demonstrate that its relaxation dynamics\nexhibits a number of scaling properties. Finally, we discuss the short-time\nentanglement dynamics in the XXZ chain in the gapless phase. The same formula\nthat describes the time dependence for the XX chain remains valid in the whole\ngapless phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2014 21:03:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 19:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-27"}

When the full sample is divided into three subsamples\n(Perseus, Centaurus+Ophiuchus+Coma, and all others), the line is significantly\ndetected in all three independent MOS spectra and the PN \"all others\" spectrum.\nIt is also detected in the Chandra spectra of Perseus with the flux consistent\nwith XMM (though it is not seen in Virgo). However, it is very weak and located\nwithin 50-110eV of several known faint lines, and so is subject to significant\nmodeling uncertainties. On the origin of this line, we argue that there should\nbe no atomic transitions in thermal plasma at this energy. An intriguing\npossibility is the decay of sterile neutrino, a long-sought dark matter\nparticle candidate. Assuming that all dark matter is in sterile neutrinos with\nm_s=2E=7.1 keV, our detection in the full sample corresponds to a neutrino\ndecay mixing angle sin^2(2theta)=7e-11, below the previous upper limits.\nHowever, based on the cluster masses and distances, the line in Perseus is much\nbrighter than expected in this model. This appears to be because of an\nanomalously bright line at E=3.62 keV in Perseus, possibly an Ar XVII\ndielectronic recombination line, although its flux would be 30 times the\nexpected value and physically difficult to understand. In principle, such an\nanomaly might explain our line detection in other subsamples as well, though it\nwould stretch the line energy uncertainties.

In this work we extend bi-linear models by\nintroducing \"higher-order mapping units\" that allow us to encode\ntransformations between frames and transformations between transformations.\n  We show that this makes it possible to encode temporal structure that is more\ncomplex and longer-range than the structure captured within standard bi-linear\nmodels. We also show that a natural way to train the model is by replacing the\ncommonly used reconstruction objective with a prediction objective which forces\nthe model to correctly predict the evolution of the input multiple steps into\nthe future. Learning can be achieved by back-propagating the multi-step\nprediction through time. We test the model on various temporal prediction\ntasks, and show that higher-order mappings and predictive training both yield a\nsignificant improvement over bi-linear models in terms of prediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2014 23:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-12"}

Our\nprogram consists of 550 hours of Spitzer/IRAC imaging covering 10 galaxy\nclusters with very well-known mass distributions, making them extremely precise\ncosmic telescopes. We combine our data with archival observations to obtain\nmosaics with ~30 hours exposure time in both 3.6$\\mu$m and 4.5$\\mu$m in the\ncentral 4 arcmin x 4 arcmin field and ~15 hours in the flanking fields. This\nresults in 3-$\\sigma$ sensitivity limits of ~26.6 and ~26.2AB magnitudes for\nthe central field in the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5$\\mu$m bands, respectively. To\nillustrate the survey strategy and characteristics we introduce the sample,\npresent the details of the data reduction and demonstrate that these data are\nsufficient for in-depth studies of z >~ 7 sources (using a z=9.5 galaxy behind\nMACSJ1149.5+2223 as an example). For the first cluster of the survey (the\nBullet Cluster) we have released all high-level data mosaics and IRAC empirical\nPSF models. In the future we plan to release these data products for the entire\nsurvey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 02:49:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 21:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The source\nJ2228+0110 was detected with VLBI with a brightness temperature T_b>10^8 K,\nsupporting the active galactic nucleus (AGN) origin of its radio emission,\nwhich is conclusive evidence that the source is a radio quasar.

Temporal growth disrupts the initial flow across the\ncomputational grid not too far from the inlet.

By restricting the computation that can be expressed\nand introducing new techniques to partition and distribute the graph, these\nsystems can efficiently execute iterative graph algorithms orders of magnitude\nfaster than more general data-parallel systems. However, the same restrictions\nthat enable the performance gains also make it difficult to express many of the\nimportant stages in a typical graph-analytics pipeline: constructing the graph,\nmodifying its structure, or expressing computation that spans multiple graphs.\nAs a consequence, existing graph analytics pipelines compose graph-parallel and\ndata-parallel systems using external storage systems, leading to extensive data\nmovement and complicated programming model.\n  To address these challenges we introduce GraphX, a distributed graph\ncomputation framework that unifies graph-parallel and data-parallel\ncomputation. GraphX provides a small, core set of graph-parallel operators\nexpressive enough to implement the Pregel and PowerGraph abstractions, yet\nsimple enough to be cast in relational algebra.

We use the impact probability to calculate the impact warning\ntime as the time interval between when an object reaches a Palermo Scale value\nof -2 and when it impacts Earth. A simple argument shows that warning time ~\nD^x with the exponent in the range [1.0,1.5] and our derived value was\n$x=1.3\\pm0.1$. The low-precision astrometry from the single simulated all-sky\nsurvey could require many days or weeks to establish an imminent impact for\nasteroids >100m diameter that are discovered far from Earth. Most close\napproaching asteroids are quickly identified as not being impactors but a\nsize-dependent percentage, even for those >50m diameter, have a persistent\nimpact probability of >10^{-6} on the day of closest approach. Thus, a single\nall-sky survey can be of tremendous value in identifying Earth impacting and\nclose approaching asteroids in advance of their closest approach but it can not\nsolve the problem on its own: high-precision astrometry from other optical or\nradar systems is necessary to rapidly establish an object as an impactor or\nclose approacher. We show that the parallax afforded by surveying the sky from\ntwo sites is only of benefit for a small fraction of the smallest objects\ndetected within a couple days before impact: probably not enough to justify the\nincreased operating costs of a 2-site survey. Finally, the survey cadence\nwithin a fixed time span is relatively unimportant to the impact probability\ncalculation. We tested three different reasonable cadences and found that one\nprovided ~10x higher (better) value for the impact probability on the discovery\nnight for the smallest (10m diameter) objects but the consequences on the\noverall impact probability calculation is negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 12:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-26"}

Neutron information is usually extracted from\ndata on nuclear targets such as deuterium, requiring corrections for nuclear\nbinding and nucleon off-shell effects. These corrections are model dependent\nand have significant uncertainties, especially for large values of the Bjorken\nscaling variable x. The Barely Off-shell Nucleon Structure (BONuS) experiment\nat Jefferson Lab measured the inelastic electron deuteron scattering cross\nsection, tagging spectator protons in coincidence with the scattered electrons.\nThis method reduces nuclear binding uncertainties significantly and has allowed\nfor the first time a (nearly) model independent extraction of the neutron\nstructure function. A novel compact radial time projection chamber was built to\ndetect protons with momentum between 70 and 150 MeV/c. For the extraction of\nthe free neutron structure function $F_{2n}$, spectator protons at backward\nangle and with momenta below 100 MeV/c were selected, ensuring that the\nscattering took place on a nearly free neutron.

Whether the disk is flat or\nflaring depends on the amount of radiation that it absorbs at a given radius,\nand on the efficiency with which this is converted into thermal energy. The\nunderstanding of these heating and cooling processes is crucial to provide a\nreliable disk structure for the interpretation of dust continuum emission and\ngas line fluxes. Especially in the upper layers of the disk, where gas and dust\nare thermally decoupled, the infrared line emission is strictly related to the\ngas heating/cooling processes. We aim to study the thermal properties of the\ndisk in the oxygen line emission region, and to investigate the relative\nimportance of X-ray (1-120 Angstrom) and far-UV radiation (FUV, 912-2070\nAngstrom) for the heating balance there.

The data\nshow that the FUV or X-ray radiation has no notable impact on the region where\nthe [OI] line is formed. This is in contrast with what is predicted from our\nmodels.

We\nconsider the classical node-register state model, with a weakly fair scheduler,\nand we present a space-optimal \\emph{silent} self-stabilizing construction of\nminimum-degree spanning trees in this model. Computing a spanning tree with\nminimum degree is NP-hard. Therefore, we actually focus on constructing a\nspanning tree whose degree is within one from the optimal. Our algorithm uses\nregisters on $O(\\log n)$ bits, converges in a polynomial number of rounds, and\nperforms polynomial-time computation at each node. Specifically, the algorithm\nconstructs and stabilizes on a special class of spanning trees, with degree at\nmost $OPT+1$. Indeed, we prove that, unless NP $=$ coNP, there are no\nproof-labeling schemes involving polynomial-time computation at each node for\nthe whole family of spanning trees with degree at most $OPT+1$. Up to our\nknowledge, this is the first example of the design of a compact silent\nself-stabilizing algorithm constructing, and stabilizing on a subset of optimal\nsolutions to a natural problem for which there are no time-efficient\nproof-labeling schemes. On our way to design our algorithm, we establish a set\nof independent results that may have interest on their own. In particular, we\ndescribe a new space-optimal silent self-stabilizing spanning tree\nconstruction, stabilizing on \\emph{any} spanning tree, in $O(n)$ rounds, and\nusing just \\emph{one} additional bit compared to the size of the labels used to\ncertify trees. We also design a silent loop-free self-stabilizing algorithm for\ntransforming a tree into another tree. Last but not least, we provide a silent\nself-stabilizing algorithm for computing and certifying the labels of a\nNCA-labeling scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 14:19:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-12"}

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod to probe sub-parsec BBHs through microlensing of lensed QSOs. If a QSO\nhosts a sub-parsec BBH in its center, it is expected that the BBH is surrounded\nby a circum-binary disk, each component of the BBH is surrounded by a small\naccretion disk, and a gap is opened by the secondary component in between the\ncircum-binary disk and the two small disks. Assuming such a BBH structure, we\ngenerate mock microlensing light curves for some QSO systems that host BBHs\nwith typical physical parameters. We show that microlensing light curves of a\nBBH QSO system at the infrared-optical-UV bands can be significantly different\nfrom those of corresponding QSO system with a single massive black hole (MBH),\nmainly because of the existence of the gap and the rotation of the BBH (and its\nassociated small disks) around the center of mass. We estimate the half-light\nradii of the emission region at different wavelengths from mock light curves\nand find that the obtained half-light radius vs. wavelength relations of BBH\nQSO systems can be much flatter than those of single MBH QSO systems at a\nwavelength range determined by the BBH parameters, such as the total mass, mass\nratio, separation, accretion rates, etc. The difference is primarily due to the\nexistence of the gap. Such unique features on the light curves and half-light\nradius-wavelength relations of BBH QSO systems can be used to select and probe\nsub-parsec BBHs in a large number of lensed QSOs to be discovered by current\nand future surveys, including the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response\nSystem (Pan-STARRS), the Large Synoptic Survey telescope (LSST) and Euclid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 14:40:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

By treating\nthe suicide as a social fact, Durkheim envisaged that suicide rates should be\ndetermined by the connections (or the lack of them) between people and society.\nUnder the same framework, Durkheim considered that crime is bound up with the\nfundamental conditions of all social life and serves a social function. In this\nsense, and regardless of its extremely deviant nature, crime events are somehow\ncapable to release certain social tensions and so have a purging effect in\nsociety. The social effect on the occurrence of homicides has been previously\nsubstantiated (Bettencourt et al., 2007; Alves et al., 2013), and confirmed\nhere, in terms of a superlinear scaling relation: by doubling the population of\na Brazilian city results in an average increment of 135 % in the number of\nhomicides, rather than the expected isometric increase of 100 %, as found, for\nexample, for the mortality due to car crashes.

(2013) developed an analytic bolometric light curve\nmodel for supernovae interacting with dense circumstellar media. Because of the\ndense circumstellar medium, the shocked region is assumed to be radiative and\nmake a thin dense shell. The model is based on the conservation of momentum in\nthe shocked dense shell. However, the analytic model was mentioned to neglect\nthe 'snow-plow' phase of the shocked dense shell by Ofek et al. (2014). The\n'snow-plow' or momentum-conserving phase refers to the period in which the\nmomentum injection from the supernova ejecta is almost terminated and the\nradiative shocked dense shell keeps moving due only to the momentum previously\nprovided by the supernova ejecta. In this Note, I clarify that the analytic\nmodel of Moriya et al. (2013) does take the 'snow-plow' phase into account and\nthe criticism of Ofek et al. (2014) is incorrect. In addition, Ofek et al.\n(2014) related the sudden luminosity break observed in the light curve of Type\nIIn SN 2010jl to the transition to the 'snow-plow' phase. However, I argue that\nthe sudden transition to the 'snow-plow' phase is not consistent with the\nluminosity break observed in SN 2010jl. The luminosity break is likely to be\nrelated to other phenomena like the dense shell exiting the dense part of the\ncircumstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 15:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-12"}

Whether these gamma rays are\ngenerated by cosmic ray electrons or by cosmic ray protons is usually not\nknown. The detection of hadronic ionization signatures in spatial coincidence\nwith gamma ray signatures can help to unambiguously identify supernova remnants\nas sources of cosmic ray protons.\n  Methods: In order to calculate hadronic signatures from cosmic ray-induced\nionization for an examination of the origin of the observed gamma rays, the\ntransport equation for cosmic ray protons propagating in a molecular cloud,\nincluding the relevant momentum loss processes, is solved analytically and the\nproton flux at any position in the cloud is determined.\n  Results: Since the solution of the transport equation is obtained for\narbitrary source functions, it can be used for a variety of supernova remnants.\nThe corresponding theoretical ionization rate, as a function of the penetration\ndepth, is derived and compared to photoinduced ionization profiles in a case\nstudy with four supernova remnants associated with molecular clouds. Three of\nthe remnants show a clear dominance of the hadronically induced ionization\nrate, while for one remnant, X-ray emission seems to dominate by a factor of\n10.\n  Conclusions: This is the first derivation of position-dependent profiles for\ncosmic ray-induced ionization with an analytic solution for arbitrary cosmic\nray source spectra. The cosmic ray-induced ionization has to be compared to\nX-ray ionization for strong X-ray sources. For sources dominated by cosmic\nray-induced ionization (e.g., W49B), the ionization profiles can be used in the\nfuture to map the spatial structure of hadronic gamma rays and\nrotation-vibrational lines induced by cosmic ray protons, helping to identify\nsources of hadronic cosmic rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 15:23:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jul 2014 08:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-15"}

This is due to battery life in portable\ndevices and operating frequency of the design. Power consumption mainly\nconsists of static power, dynamic power, leakage power and short circuit power.\nDynamic power is dominant among all which depends on many factors viz. power\nsupply, load capacitance and frequency. Switching activity also affects dynamic\npower consumption of bus which is determined by calculating the number of bit\ntransitions on bus. The purpose of this paper is to design a bit transition\ncounter which can be used to calculate the switching activity of the circuit\nnodes. The novel feature is that it can be inserted at any node of the circuit,\nthus helpful for calculating power consumption of bus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 15:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-12"}

Our method dynamically\nchanges the number of particles allocated to each pedestrian based on different\nconfidence metrics.

We highlight\nthe performance benefits of our algorithm over prior techniques using this\ndataset. In practice, our algorithm can compute trajectories of tens of\npedestrians on a multi-core desktop CPU at interactive rates (27-30 frames per\nsecond).

MANETs are often\ndeployed in the environments, where there is no fixed infrastructure and\ncentralized management. The nodes of mobile ad hoc networks are susceptible to\ncompromise. In such a scenario, designing an efficient, reliable and secure\nrouting protocol has been a major challengesue over the last many years. The\nrouting protocol Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) has no security\nmeasures in-built in it. It is vulnerable to many types of routing attacks. The\nflood attack is one of them. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective\ntechnique to secure Ad hoc Ondemand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol\nagainst flood attacks. To deal with a flood attack, we have proposed Neighbor\nDefense Technique for Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (NDTAODV). This makes\nAODV more robust. The proposed technique has been designed to isolate the flood\nattacker with the use of timers, peak value and hello alarm technique. We have\nsimulated our work in Network Simulator NS-2.33 (NS-2) with different pause\ntimes by way of different number of malicious nodes. We have compared the\nperformance of NDTAODV with the AODV in normal situation as well as in the\npresence of malicious attacks.
