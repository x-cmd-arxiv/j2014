We studied the\nmechanism carefully by high order DNS. The randomization was originally\nconsidered as a result of large background noise and non-periodic spanwise\nboundary conditions. It was addressed that the large ring structure is affected\nby background noises first and then the change of large ring structure affects\nthe small length scale quickly, which directly leads to randomization and\nformation of turbulence. However, what we observed is that the loss of symmetry\nstarts from the middle level rings while the top and bottom rings are still\nsymmetric. The nonsymmetric structure of second level rings will influence the\nsmall length scales at the boundary layer bottom quickly. The symmetry loss at\nthe bottom of the boundary layer is quickly spread to up level through\nejections. This will lead to randomization of the whole flow field. Therefore,\nthe internal instability of multiple level ring structure, especially the\nmiddle ring cycles, is the main reason for flow randomization, but not the\nbackground noise. A hypothesis is given that the loss of symmetry may be caused\nby the shift from C-type transition to K-type transition or reverses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 16:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-25"}

It was widely accepted that small length\nvortices were generated by large vortex breakdown. According to our recent DNS,\nwe find that the hairpin vortex structure is very stable and never breaks down\nto small pieces. On the other hand, we recognize that there are strong positive\nspikes besides the ring neck in the spanwise direction. The strongly positive\nspikes are caused by second sweeps which are generated by perfectly circular\nand perpendicularly standing vortex rings. The second sweep brings energy from\nthe invisid region downdraft to the bottom of the boundary layers, which\ngenerates high shear layers around the positive spikes.Since the high shear\nlayer is not stable, all small length scales (turbulence) are generated around\nhigh shear layers especially near the wall surface (bottom of boundary layers).\nThis happens near the ring neck in the streamwise direction and besides the\noriginal vortex legs in the spanwise direction.The small length scales then\nrise up from the wall surface and travel to the upper boundary layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 17:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-25"}

We consider the\npointwise Jacobi, the Chebyshev-accelerated Jacobi and the symmetric successive\nover-relaxation (SSOR) smoothers, as well as elementwise block Jacobi\nsmoothing. Three approaches for the multigrid hierarchy are compared: 1)\nhigh-order $h$-multigrid, which uses high-order interpolation and restriction\nbetween geometrically coarsened meshes; 2) $p$-multigrid, in which the\npolynomial order is reduced while the mesh remains unchanged, and the\ninterpolation and restriction incorporate the different-order basis functions;\nand 3), a first-order approximation multigrid preconditioner constructed using\nthe nodes of the high-order discretization. This latter approach is often\ncombined with algebraic multigrid for the low-order operator and is attractive\nfor high-order discretizations on unstructured meshes, where geometric\ncoarsening is difficult. Based on a simple performance model, we compare the\ncomputational cost of the different approaches.

While all of the tested methods converge in a\nmesh-independent number of iterations, none of them behaves completely\nindependent of the polynomial order.

We find that the\ntimescale required to reach equilibrium, tau_eq, which is determined by the\nproduct of star-formation efficiency and mass-loading factor, is the central\nparameter that is essentially in control of the evolution of all key galaxy\nproperties. The scatters in most of the key scaling relations, such as the\nmass-SFR relation and mass-metallicity relation, are primarily governed by\ntau_eq. Most strikingly, the predicted sSFR evolution is controlled solely by\ntau_eq (apart from the cosmic time). Although the precise evolution of the sSFR\ndepends on tau_eq, the sSFR history is largely insensitive to different values\nof tau_eq. The difference between the minimum and maximum sSFR at any epoch is\nless than a factor of four. The shape of the predicted sSFR history simply\nmimics that of the specific mass increase rate of the dark matter halos\n(sMIR_DM) with the typical value of the sSFR around 2*sMIR_DM, in good\nagreement with the predictions from typical Semi-Analytic Models (SAMs), but\nboth are fundamentally different from the observed sSFR history.

Depending on\nthe thermodynamic conditions, i.e., the effectiveness of radiative cooling, and\nthe radial surface density profile, planets migrate inward or outward. Clearly,\nthis will influence the semimajor axis - mass distribution of planets as\npredicted by population synthesis simulations. Aims: Our goal is to study the\nglobal effects of radiative cooling, viscous torque desaturation and gap\nopening as well as stellar irradiation on the tidal migration of a synthetic\nplanet population. Methods: We combine results from several analytical studies\nand 3D hydrodynamic simulations in a new semi-analytical migration model for\nthe application in our planet population synthesis calculations. Results: We\nfind a good agreement of our model with torques obtained in a 3D radiative\nhydrodynamic simulations. We find three convergence zones in a typical disc,\ntowards which planets migrate from the in- and outside, affecting strongly the\nmigration behavior of low-mass planets. Interestingly, this leads to slow type\nII like migration behavior for low-mass planets captured in those zones even\nwithout an ad hoc migration rate reduction factor or a yet to be defined\nhalting mechanism. This means that the new prescription of migration including\nnon-isothermal effects makes the preciously widely used artificial migration\nrate reduction factor obsolete. Conclusions: Outward migration in parts of a\ndisc makes some planets survive long enough to become massive. The convergence\nzones lead to a potentially observable accumulations of low-mass planets at\ncertain semimajor axes. Our results indicate that further studies of the mass\nwhere the corotation torque saturates will be needed since its value has a\nmajor impact on the properties of planet populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 21:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

We revisit in detail the impact of atmospheric effects on\nthe quality of VIMOS-MOS spectra. We model slit losses across the entire VIMOS\nFOV as a function of target declination. We explore two different slit\norientations at the meridian: along the parallactic angle (North-South), and\nperpendicular to it (East-West). We show that, for fields culminating at zenith\ndistances larger than 20 deg, slit losses are minimised with slits oriented\nalong the parallactic angle at the meridian.

Conversely, for fields with zenith\nangles smaller than 20 deg at culmination, losses are minimised with slits\noriented perpendicular to the parallactic angle at the meridian.

The\nproblem is that we obtain a negative squared mass for the saxion, the scalar\npartner of the axion, at the minimum. We then consider the minimal extension in\norder to get a consistent model for all scales: one has to include an\nadditional explicit sector to spontaneously break the PQ symmetry. In the\ncomplete model we can determine the mass of the axino, the fermionic partner of\nthe axion. It is useful to distinguish two cases: (1) the supersymmetry (SUSY)\nbreaking scale is lower than the PQ breaking scale, and (2) the scales are\ncomparable. We find that the axino is very light in (1), while its mass is\ngenerically of the order of the other soft SUSY breaking masses in (2).

These maps have energies\ntaking all values between zero and the energy of the unique co-rotational\nEuclidean harmonic map, Q, from the Euclidean plane to the 2-sphere, given by\nstereographic projection. We prove that the harmonic maps are asymptotically\nstable for values of the parameter smaller than a threshold that is large\nenough to allow for maps that wrap more than halfway around the sphere. Indeed,\nwe prove Strichartz estimates for the operator obtained by linearizing around\nsuch a harmonic map. However, for harmonic maps with energies approaching the\nEuclidean energy of Q, asymptotic stability via a perturbative argument based\non Strichartz estimates is precluded by the existence of gap eigenvalues in the\nspectrum of the linearized operator.\n  When the target is 2d hyperbolic space, we find a continuous family of\nasymptotically stable equivariant harmonic maps with arbitrarily small and\narbitrarily large energies.

This\npaper advances the state-of-the-art analysis of TTL-based cache networks by\ndeveloping two exact methods with orthogonal generality and computational\ncomplexity. The first method generalizes existing results for line networks\nunder renewal requests to the broad class of caching policies whereby evictions\nare driven by stopping times. The obtained results are further generalized,\nusing the second method, to feedforward networks with Markov arrival processes\n(MAP) requests. MAPs are particularly suitable for non-line networks because\nthey are closed not only under superposition and splitting, as known, but also\nunder input-output caching operations as proven herein for phase-type TTL\ndistributions. The crucial benefit of the two closure properties is that they\njointly enable the first exact analysis of feedforward networks of TTL caches\nin great generality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 21:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

The manual\ndevelopment of such knowledge is a tedious and error-prone task, thus\nevent-based applications may benefit from automated knowledge construction\ntechniques, such as Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), which combines machine\nlearning with the declarative and formal semantics of First-Order Logic.\nHowever, learning temporal logical formalisms, which are typically utilized by\nlogic-based Event Recognition systems is a challenging task, which most ILP\nsystems cannot fully undertake. In addition, event-based data is usually\nmassive and collected at different times and under various circumstances.\nIdeally, systems that learn from temporal data should be able to operate in an\nincremental mode, that is, revise prior constructed knowledge in the face of\nnew evidence. Most ILP systems are batch learners, in the sense that in order\nto account for new evidence they have no alternative but to forget past\nknowledge and learn from scratch. Given the increased inherent complexity of\nILP and the volumes of real-life temporal data, this results to algorithms that\nscale poorly. In this work we present an incremental method for learning and\nrevising event-based knowledge, in the form of Event Calculus programs. The\nproposed algorithm relies on abductive-inductive learning and comprises a\nscalable clause refinement methodology, based on a compressive summarization of\nclause coverage in a stream of examples. We present an empirical evaluation of\nour approach on real and synthetic data from activity recognition and city\ntransport applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 21:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2014 13:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

The theoretical and numerical results indicate that\nthe pinned winding number, or equivalently the winding number of the superfluid\ncurrent about the laser beam, decays as a laser beam of fixed intensity moves\naway from the BEC center. Our theoretical analysis helps explain previous\nexperimental observations, and helps define limits of stable vortex pinning for\nfuture experiments involving vortex manipulation by laser beams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 22:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

We performed spectral analysis down to 4 ms\ntime-scales, to characterize the spectral evolution of the bursts. Using a\nComptonized model, we find that the peak energy, E_peak, anti-correlates with\nflux, while the low-energy photon index remains constant at -0.8 up to a flux\nlimit F~10^-5 erg s-1 cm-2. Above this flux value the E_peak-flux correlation\nchanges sign, and the index positively correlates with flux reaching 1 at the\nhighest fluxes. Using a two black-body model, we find that the areas and fluxes\nof the two emitting regions correlate positively. Further, we study here for\nthe first time, the evolution of the temperatures and areas as a function of\nflux. We find that the area-kT relation follows lines of constant luminosity at\nthe lowest fluxes, R^2 \\propto kT^-4, with a break at higher fluxes ($F>10^-5.5\nerg s-1 cm-2). The area of the high-kT component increases with flux while its\ntemperature decreases, which we interpret as due to an adiabatic cooling\nprocess.

The\nabsolute Galois group of K acts on T by tree automorphisms, giving a subgroup\nG(phi) of the group Aut(T) of all tree automorphisms. Beginning in the 1980s\nwith work of Odoni, and developing especially over the past decade, a\nsignificant body of work has emerged on the size and structure of this Galois\nrepresentation. These inquiries arose in part because knowledge of G(phi)\nallows one to prove density results on the set of primes of K that divide at\nleast one element of a given orbit of phi.\n  Following an overview of the history of the subject and two of its\nfundamental questions, we survey cases where G(phi) is known to have finite\nindex in Aut(T). While it is tempting to conjecture that such behavior should\nhold in general, we exhibit four classes of rational functions where it does\nnot, illustrating the difficulties in formulating the proper conjecture.\nFortunately, one can achieve the aforementioned density results with\ncomparatively little information about G(phi), thanks in part to a surprising\napplication of probability theory. Underlying all of this analysis are results\non the factorization into irreducibles of the numerators of iterates of phi,\nwhich we survey briefly. We find that for each of these matters, the arithmetic\nof the forward orbits of the critical points of phi proves decisive, just as\nthe topology of these orbits is decisive in complex dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 23:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

Two main approaches to the calculation of\ndirectivity patterns of laser-generated sound are discussed for the most\nimportant case of thermo-optical regime of generation. The first approach,\nwhich is widely used in practice, is based on the simple modelling of the\nequivalent thermo-optical source as a mechanical dipole comprising two\nhorizontal forces applied to the surface in opposite directions. The second\napproach is based on the rigorous theory that takes into account all\nacoustical, optical and thermal parameters of a solid material and all\ngeometrical and physical parameters of a laser beam. Directivity patterns of\nlaser-generated bulk longitudinal and shear elastic waves, as well as the\namplitudes of generated Rayleigh surface waves, are calculated for different\nvalues of physical and geometrical parameters and compared with the directivity\npatterns calculated in case of dipole-source representation. It is demonstrated\nthat the simple approach using a dipole-source representation of\nlaser-generated sound is rather limited, especially for description of\ngenerated longitudinal acoustic waves. A practical criterion is established to\ndefine the conditions under which the dipole-source representation gives\npredictions with acceptable errors. It is shown that, for radiation in the\nnormal direction to the surface, the amplitudes of longitudinal waves are\nespecially sensitive to the values of thermal parameters and of the acoustic\nreflection coefficient from a free solid surface. A discussion is given on the\npossibility of using such a high sensitivity to the values of the reflection\ncoefficient for investigation of surface properties of real solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 00:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

Results show that the nonconvex variational problem could\nhave multiple solutions at each material point, the complementary gap function\nand the triality theory can be used to identify both global and local extremal\nsolutions, while the popular (poly-, quasi-, and rank-one) convexities provide\nonly local minimal criteria, the Legendre-Hadamard condition does not guarantee\nuniqueness of solutions. This paper demonstrates again that the pure\ncomplementary energy principle and the triality theory play important roles in\nfinite deformation theory and nonconvex analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 00:41:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 05:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-06"}

This paper presents a thorough empirical study of the most\npopular multi-armed bandit algorithms. Three important observations can be made\nfrom our results. Firstly, simple heuristics such as epsilon-greedy and\nBoltzmann exploration outperform theoretically sound algorithms on most\nsettings by a significant margin. Secondly, the performance of most algorithms\nvaries dramatically with the parameters of the bandit problem. Our study\nidentifies for each algorithm the settings where it performs well, and the\nsettings where it performs poorly. Thirdly, the algorithms' performance\nrelative each to other is affected only by the number of bandit arms and the\nvariance of the rewards. This finding may guide the design of subsequent\nempirical evaluations. In the second part of the paper, we turn our attention\nto an important area of application of bandit algorithms: clinical trials.\nAlthough the design of clinical trials has been one of the principal practical\nproblems motivating research on multi-armed bandits, bandit algorithms have\nnever been evaluated as potential treatment allocation strategies. Using data\nfrom a real study, we simulate the outcome that a 2001-2002 clinical trial\nwould have had if bandit algorithms had been used to allocate patients to\ntreatments.

Recently, RPQs have\nbeen extended by Libkin and Vrgo$\\rm \\check{c}$ to incorporate data value\ncomparisons among different nodes on paths, called regular path queries with\ndata (RDPQ). It has been shown that the evaluation problem of RDPQs is\nPSPACE-complete and NLOGSPACE-complete in data complexity. On the other hand,\nthe containment problem of RDPQs is in general undecidable. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach to extend regular path queries with data value\ncomparisons, called rigid regular path queries with data (RRDPQ). The main\ningredient of this approach is an automata model called nondeterministic rigid\nregister automata (NRRA), in which the data value comparisons are \\emph{rigid},\nin the sense that if the data value in the current position $x$ is compared to\na data value in some other position $y$, then by only using the labels (but not\ndata values), the position $y$ can be uniquely determined from $x$. We show\nthat NRRAs are robust in the sense that nondeterministic, deterministic and\ntwo-way variant of NRRAs, as well as an extension of regular expressions, are\nall of the same expressivity. We then argue that the expressive power of RDPQs\nare reasonable by demonstrating that for every graph database, there is a\nlocalized transformation of the graph database so that every RDPQ in the\noriginal graph database can be turned into an equivalent RRDPQ over the\ntransformed one. Finally, we investigate the computational properties of RRDPQs\nand conjunctive RRDPQs (CRRDPQ).

The\nanalysis shows that after realistic antenna isolation and RF cancellation, the\ndominant self-interference waveform at receiver digital baseband can be modeled\nthrough a widely-linear transformation of the original transmit data, opposed\nto classical purely linear models. Such widely-linear self-interference\nwaveform is physically stemming from the transmitter and receiver IQ imaging,\nand cannot be efficiently suppressed by classical linear digital cancellation.\nMotivated by this, novel widely-linear digital self-interference cancellation\nprocessing is then proposed and formulated, combined with efficient parameter\nestimation methods.

A recent study from the SLUGGS survey has shown that the GCs in\nthis galaxy follow a bimodal distribution of Ca II triplet indices. Thus, NGC\n3115 presents a critical example of a GC system with multiple, distinct,\nmetallicity subpopulations, and this may argue against the \"projection\"\nscenario, which posits that the ubiquitous color bimodality mainly results from\nnonlinearities in the color-metallicity relations.

The basic\nidea is, by using the special features of the PDMPs, to re-write the problem\nvia an embedded discrete-time Markov chain associated to the PDMP and\nre-formulate the problem as an infinite dimensional linear programming (LP)\nproblem, via the occupation measures associated to the discrete-time process.\nIt is important to stress however that our new discrete-time problem is not in\nthe same framework of a general constrained discrete-time Markov Decision\nProcess and, due to that, some conditions are required to get the equivalence\nbetween the continuous-time problem and the LP formulation.

We developed a Monte Carlo\nGalactic propagation code for ~MeV positrons in which the Galactic interstellar\nmedium, the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) and the propagation are finely\ndescribed. This code allows us to simulate the spatial distribution of the 511\nkeV annihilation emission. We test several GMFs models and several positron\nescape fractions from type-Ia supernova for 56Ni positrons. We consider the\ncollisional ballistic transport mode and then compare the simulated 511 keV\nintensity spatial distributions to the INTEGRAL/SPI data. Whatever the GMF\nconfiguration and the escape fraction chosen for 56Ni positrons, the 511 keV\nintensity distributions are very similar. The main reason is that ~MeV\npositrons do not propagate very far away from their birth sites in our model.\nThe direct comparison to the data does not allow us to constrain the GMF\nconfiguration and the escape fraction for 56Ni positrons.

This article presents\nan overview of recent developments across different disciplines to address\nthis. We review diagnostic techniques, including graphical approaches and\nsummary statistics, to help highlight decisions made through minimised expected\nloss that are sensitive to model misspecification. We then consider formal\nmethods for decision making under model misspecification by quantifying\nstability of optimal actions to perturbations to the model within a\nneighbourhood of model space. This neighbourhood is defined in either one of\ntwo ways. Firstly, in a strong sense via an information (Kullback-Leibler)\ndivergence around the approximating model. Or using a nonparametric model\nextension, again centred at the approximating model, in order to `average out'\nover possible misspecifications.

In the proposed\nconstruction one does not make use of any differential equations of motion,\nLagrangians, etc. Instead, we define a \"unique\" worldline implicitly, by a\nsystem of nonlinear polynomial equations containing a time-like parameter. Then\nat each instant there is a whole set of solutions defining the coordinates of\nparticles-copies localized on the unique worldline and moving along it. There\nnaturally arise two different kinds of such particles which correspond to real\nor complex conjugate roots of the initial system of polynomial equations,\nrespectively. At some particular time instants, one encounters the transitions\nbetween these two kinds of particles-roots that model the processes of\nannihilation or creation of a pair \"particle-antiparticle\". We restrict by\nconsideration of nonrelativistic collective dynamics of the ensemble of such\nparticles on a plane. Making use of the techniques of resultants of\npolynomials, the generating system reduces to a pair of polynomial equations\nfor one unknown, with coefficients depending on time. Then the well-known Vieta\nformulas predetermine the existence of time-independent constraints on the\npositions of particles-roots and their time derivatives. We demonstrate that\nfor a very wide class of the initial polynomials (with polynomial dependence of\nthe coefficients on time) these constraints always take place and have the form\nof the conservation laws for total momentum, angular momentum and (the analogue\nof) total mechanical energy of the \"closed\" system of particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 12:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 13:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-27"}

Macromolecular plasma proteins such as fibrinogen\ncause red blood cells to form large aggregates, called rouleaux, which are\nusually assumed to be disaggregated in the circulation due to the shear forces\npresent in bulk flow. This leads to the assumption that rouleaux formation is\nonly relevant in the venule network and in arterioles at low shear rates or\nstasis. Thanks to an excellent agreement between combined experimental and\nnumerical approaches, we show that despite the large shear rates present in\nmicrocapillaries, the presence of either fibrinogen or the synthetic polymer\ndextran leads to an enhanced formation of robust clusters of red blood cells,\neven at haematocrits as low as 1%. Robust aggregates are shown to exist in\nmicrocapillaries even for fibrinogen concentrations within the healthy\nphysiological range. These persistent aggregates should strongly affect cell\ndistribution and blood perfusion in the microvasculature, with putative\nimplications for blood disorders even within apparently asymptomatic subjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 14:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

The major\nachievement of this work is the first detection of the faint CII 4267\nrecombination line in a Wolf-Rayet nebula.

The Ne abundance also show a puzzling pattern with an abundance of about\n0.5 dex lower than the solar vicinity, which may be related to the action of\nthe NeNa cycle. Attending to the constraints imposed by the dynamical timescale\nand the He/H and N/O ratios of the nebula, the comparison with stellar\nevolution models indicates that the initial mass of the stellar progenitor of\nNGC6888 is between 25 Msun and 40 Msun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 14:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The flow randomization is a crucial phase before flow\ntransition to the turbulent state. According to existing literatures, the\nrandomization was caused by the big background noises and non-periodic spanwise\nboundary conditions. It was assumed that the large ring structure is affected\nby background noises first, and then the change of large ring structure affects\nthe small length scales quickly, which directly leads to randomization and\nformation of turbulence. However, by careful analysis of our high order DNS\nresults, we believe that the internal instability of multiple ring cycles\nstructure is the main reason. What we observed is that randomization begins\nwhen the third cycle overlaps the first and second cycles. A significant\nasymmetric phenomenon is originated from the second cycle in the middle of both\nstreamwise and spanwise directions. More technically, a visible asymmetric\nphenomenon in the middle vortex ring cycle starts at time step t=16.25T and\nx=838.9{\\delta}in where the top and bottom level rings are still completely\nsymmetric. The non-symmetric structure of middle level ring affects the small\nlength scale in boundary layer bottom quickly. The randomization phenomenon\nspreads to top level through ejections. Finally, the whole flow domain becomes\nrandomized. A hypothesis of C- and K-types shift is given as a possible\nmechanism of flow randomization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 14:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

This includes mechanism of the large coherent vortex\nstructure formation, small length scale generation and flow randomization. The\nwidely spread concept vortex breakdown to turbulence,which was considered as\nthe last stage of flow transition, is not observed and is found theoretically\nincorrect. The classical theory on boundary layer transition is challenged and\nwe proposed a new theory with five steps, i.e. receptivity, linear instability,\nlarge vortex formation, small length scale generation, loss of symmetry and\nrandomization to turbulence. We have also proposed a new theory about\nturbulence generation. The new theory shows that all small length scales\n(turbulence) are generated by shear layer instability which is produced by\nlarge vortex structure with multiple level vortex rings, multiple level sweeps\nand ejections, and multiple level negative and positive spikes near the laminar\nsub-layers.Therefore, turbulence is not generated by vortex breakdown but\nrather positive and negative spikes and consequent high shear layers. Shear\nlayer instability is considered as the mother of turbulence. This new theory\nmay give a universal mechanism for turbulence generation and sustenance which\nshows that the energy is brought by large vortex structure through multiple\nlevel sweeps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 15:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

Our data\nset consists of Chandra observations of 40 such clusters, identified in a\ncomprehensive search of the Chandra archive, as well as high-quality weak\ngravitational lensing data for a subset of these clusters. Incorporating a\nrobust gravitational lensing calibration of the X-ray mass estimates, and\nrestricting our measurements to the most self-similar and accurately measured\nregions of clusters, significantly reduces systematic uncertainties compared to\nprevious work. Our data for the first time constrain the intrinsic scatter in\n$f_{gas}$, $(7.4\\pm2.3)$% in a spherical shell at radii 0.8-1.2 $r_{2500}$,\nconsistent with the expected variation in gas depletion and non-thermal\npressure for relaxed clusters.

Combined with standard priors on $h$ and $\\Omega_b h^2$,\nthis provides a tight constraint on the cosmic matter density,\n$\\Omega_m=0.27\\pm0.04$, which is similarly insensitive to dark energy.

The multichromophoric FRET rate is determined by the\noverlap integral of the donor's emission and acceptor's absorption spectra,\nwhich are obtained via 2nd-order cumulant expansion techniques developed in\nthis work. We calculate the spectra and multichromophoric FRET rate for both\nlocalized and delocalized systems. (i) The role of the initial entanglement\nbetween the donor and its bath is found to be crucial in both the emission\nspectrum and the multichromophoric FRET rate. (ii) The absorption spectra\nobtained by the cumulant expansion method are quite close to the exact one for\nboth localized and delocalized systems, even when the system-bath coupling is\nfar from the perturbative regime. (iii) For the emission spectra, the cumulant\nexpansion can give very good results for the localized system, but fail to\nobtain reliable spectra of the high excitations of a delocalized system, when\nthe system-bath coupling is large and the thermal energy is small. (iv) Even\nthough, the multichromophoric FRET rate is good enough since it is determined\nby the overlap integral of the spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2014 21:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}
