This is\na consequence of very weak, if any, dependences of radio luminosity $L$ on\npulsar period $P$ and period derivative $\\dot{P}$, in contrast to X-ray or\n$\\gamma$-ray emission luminosities. The analysis of radio fluxes suggests that\nthese correlations are not due to a selection effect, but are intrinsic to the\npulsar radio emission physics. We have found that, although with a large\nvariance, the radio luminosity of pulsars is $\\left<L\\right>\\approx 10^{29}\n\\,{\\rm erg/s}$, regardless of the position in the $P-\\dot P$ diagram. Within\nsuch a picture, a model-independent statement can be made that the death line\nof radio pulsars corresponds to an upper limit in the efficiency of radio\nemission.

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test on a synthetic flux\ndistribution shows high probability of reproducing the observed distribution.\nOur results suggests that the plasma responsible for generating radio emission\nis produced under similar conditions regardless of pulsar age, dipolar magnetic\nfield strength, and spin-down rate. The magnetic fields near the pulsar surface\nare likely dominated by crust-anchored magnetic anomalies, which do not\nsignificantly differ among pulsars, leading to similar conditions for\ngenerating electron-positron pairs necessary to power radio emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2014 18:28:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The `giant eruptions', however, must involve much deeper regions in\nthe stellar core to cause such large amounts of mass to be ejected.

Entity resolution-the data integration problem of performing\nnoisy joins on structured data-typically proceeds by first hashing each record\ninto zero or more blocks, scoring pairs of records that are co-blocked for\nsimilarity, and then matching pairs of sufficient similarity. In the most\ncommon case of matching two sources, it is often desirable for the final\nmatching to be one-to-one (a record may be matched with at most one other);\nmembers of the database and statistical record linkage communities accomplish\nsuch matchings in the final stage by weighted bipartite graph matching on\nsimilarity scores. Such matchings are intuitively appealing: they leverage a\nnatural global property of many real-world entity stores-that of being nearly\ndeduped-and are known to provide significant improvements to precision and\nrecall. Unfortunately unlike the bipartite case, exact max-weight matching on\nmulti-partite graphs is known to be NP-hard. Our two-fold algorithmic\ncontributions approximate multi-partite max-weight matching: our first\nalgorithm borrows optimization techniques common to Bayesian probabilistic\ninference; our second is a greedy approximation algorithm.

Due to limited feedback and hence\nimperfect IA, there are residual interferences across different links and\ndifferent data streams. As a result, the performance of IA is greatly related\nto the CSI accuracy (namely number of feedback bits) and the number of data\nstreams (namely transmission mode). In order to improve the performance of IA,\nit makes sense to optimize the system parameters according to the channel\nconditions. Motivated by this, we first give a quantitative performance\nanalysis for IA under limited feedback, and derive a closed-form expression for\nthe average transmission rate in terms of feedback bits and transmission mode.\nBy maximizing the average transmission rate, we obtain an adaptive feedback\nallocation scheme, as well as a dynamic mode selection scheme. Furthermore,\nthrough asymptotic analysis, we obtain several clear insights on the system\nperformance, and provide some guidelines on the system design. Finally,\nsimulation results validate our theoretical claims, and show that obvious\nperformance gain can be obtained by adjusting feedback bits dynamically or\nselecting transmission mode adaptively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 07:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The 8Be\nstates consist of two groups of ground band states and highly excited states\nwith the isospin T=0 and T=1.

Using a recent compilation of HI and CO data we\nstudy the effects of the cluster on the molecular gas content of spiral\ngalaxies.

We show that, on average, HI-deficient galaxies are\nsignificantly offset from the M(H2) vs. M* relation for HI-normal galaxies. We\nuse the M(H2) vs. M* scaling relation to define the H2-deficiency parameter.\nThis parameter shows a weak and scattered relation with the HI-def, here taken\nas a proxy for galaxy interactions with the cluster environment. We also show\nthat, as for the HI, the extent of the H2 disc decreases with increasing\nHI-deficiency. These results show that cluster galaxies have, on average, a\nlower H2 content than similar objects in the field. The slope of the H2-def vs.\nHI-def relation is less than 1, while the D(HI)/D(i) vs. HI-def relation is\nsteeper than the D(CO)/D(i) vs. HI-def relation, thereby indicating that the H2\ngas is removed less efficiently than the HI. This result can be understood if\nthe HI is distributed on a flat disc more extended than the stellar disc, thus\nless anchored to the gravitational potential well of the galaxy than the H2.\nThere is a clear trend between the NUV-i colour and H2-def, which suggests that\nH2 removal quenches the activity of star formation. This causes galaxies\nmigrate from the blue cloud to the green valley and, eventually, to the red\nsequence. The total gas-consumption timescale of gas deficient cluster galaxies\nis comparable to that of isolated systems, and is significantly larger than the\ntypical timescale for total gas removal in a ram pressure stripping process,\nthus suggesting that ram pressure, rather than starvation, is the dominant\nprocess driving the evolution of these cluster galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 10:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

His 1964 theorem is the\nincompatibility of quantum phenomena with the dual assumptions of locality and\ndeterminism. His 1976 theorem is the incompatibility of quantum phenomena with\nthe unitary property of local causality. This is contrary to Bell's own later\nassertions, that his 1964 theorem began with that single, and indivisible,\nassumption of local causality (even if not by that name). While there are other\nforms of Bell's theorems --- which I present to explain the relation between\nJarrett-completeness, \"fragile locality\", and EPR-completeness --- I maintain\nthat Bell's two versions are the essential ones. Although the two Bell's\ntheorems are logically equivalent, their assumptions are not, and the different\nversions of the theorem suggest quite different conclusions, which are embraced\nby different communities. For realists, the notion of local causality, ruled\nout by Bell's 1976 theorem, is motivated implicitly by Reichenbach's Principle\nof common cause and explicitly by the Principle of relativistic causality, and\nit is the latter which must be forgone. Operationalists pay no heed to\nReichenbach's Principle, but wish to keep the Principle of relativistic\ncausality, which, bolstered by an implicit \"Principle of agent-causation\",\nimplies their notion of locality. Thus for operationalists, Bell's theorem is\nthe 1964 one, and implies that it is determinism that must be forgone. I\ndiscuss why the two `camps' are drawn to these different conclusions, and what\ncan be done to increase mutual understanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 11:57:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 16:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

Therefore, the extracted scaling\nexponents $\\zeta(n)$ might be biased due to this effect. In this paper, a\ndetrended structure-function (DSF) method is proposed to extract scaling\nexponents by constraining the influence of large-scale structures. This is\naccomplished by removing a $1$st-order polynomial fitting within a window size\n$\\ell$ before calculating the velocity increment. By doing so, the scales\nlarger than $\\ell$, i.e., $r\\ge \\ell$, are expected to be removed or\nconstrained. The detrending process is equivalent to be a high-pass filter in\nphysical domain. Meanwhile the intermittency nature is retained. We first\nvalidate the DSF method by using a synthesized fractional Brownian motion for\nmono-fractal processes and a lognormal process for multifractal random walk\nprocesses. The numerical results show comparable scaling exponents $\\zeta(n)$\nand singularity spectra $D(h)$ for the original SFs and DSFs. When applying the\nDSF to a turbulent velocity obtained from a high Reynolds number wind tunnel\nexperiment with $Re_{\\lambda}\\simeq 720$, the 3rd-order DSF demonstrates a\nclear inertial range with $\\mathcal{B}_3(\\ell)\\simeq 4/5\\epsilon \\ell$ on the\nrange $10<\\ell/\\eta<1000$, corresponding to a wavenumber range\n$0.001<k\\eta<0.1$.

Due to large-scale effects, the results\nprovided by the SFs are biased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 12:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Complex molecules can\nbe studied more directly in transitional disks with large inner holes, as these\nhave a higher potential of detection, through UV heating of the outer disk and\nthe directly exposed midplane at the wall.

The resulting triangulation is a physical data structure that is a\ncompact representation of the workspace; it contains distributed knowledge of\neach triangle, adjacent triangles, and the dual graph of the workspace.\nAlgorithms can store information in this physical data structure, such as a\nrouting table for robot navigation Our algorithm builds a triangulation in a\nclosed environment, starting from a single location.

The latter in particular, however, requires knowledge\nof the properties of the individual components of the system. Here we present\nprecise optical spectroscopy of the inner companion in the PSR J0337+1715\nsystem. We confirm it as a hot, low-gravity DA white dwarf with\nTeff=15,800+/-100 K and log(g)=5.82+/-0.05. We also measure an inner mass ratio\nof 0.1364+/-0.0015, entirely consistent with that inferred from pulsar timing,\nand a systemic radial velocity of 29.7+/-0.3 km/s. Combined with the mass\n(0.19751 Msun) determined from pulsar timing, our measurement of the surface\ngravity implies a radius of 0.091+/-0.005 Rsun; combined further with the\neffective temperature and extinction, the photometry implies a distance of\n1300+/-80 pc. The high temperature of the companion is somewhat puzzling: with\ncurrent models, it likely requires a recent period of unstable hydrogen\nburning, and suggests a surprisingly short lifetime for objects at this phase\nin their evolution. We discuss the implications of these measurements in the\ncontext of understanding the PSR J0337+1715 system, as well as of low-mass\nwhite dwarfs in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Feb 2014 15:54:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 19:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

In inverse calculations one aims to characterize the set\nof models that fit the data (among other constraints). If the data misfit\nfunction is unimodal then one can find its peak by local optimization methods\nand characterize its width (related to the range of data-fitting models) by\nestimating derivatives at this peak. On the other hand, if there are local\nextrema, then a number of interesting and difficult problems arise. Are the\nlocal extrema important compared to the global or can they be eliminated (e.g.,\nby smoothing) without significant loss of information? Is there a sufficiently\nsmall number of local extrema that they can be enumerated via local\noptimization? What are the basins of attraction of these local extrema? Can two\nextrema be joined by a path that never goes uphill? Can the whole problem be\nreduced to one of enumerating the local extrema and their basins of attraction?\nFor locally ill-conditioned functions, premature convergence of local\noptimization can be confused with the presence of local extrema. Addressing any\nof these issues requires topographic information about the functions under\nstudy. But in many applications these functions may have hundreds or thousands\nof variables and can only be evaluated pointwise (by some numerical method for\ninstance). In this paper we describe systematic (but generic) methods of\nanalysing the topography of high dimensional functions using local optimization\nmethods applied to randomly chosen starting models. We provide a number of\nquantitative measures of function topography that have proven to be useful in\npractical problems along with error estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2014 22:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-14"}
