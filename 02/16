Within this endeavor, the harnessing of many-body entanglement\nagainst the effects of the environment is a pressing issue. Besides being an\nimportant concept from a fundamental standpoint, entanglement is recognized as\na crucial resource for performance enhancements over classical methods.\nUnderstanding and controlling many-body entanglement in open systems may have\nimplications in quantum computing, quantum simulations, secure quantum\ncommunication, quantum metrology, our understanding of the quantum-to-classical\ntransition, and other important questions of quantum foundations.\n  Here we present an overview of recent theoretical and experimental efforts to\nunderpin the dynamics of entanglement in open quantum systems. Entanglement is\ntaken as a dynamic quantity, and we survey how it evolves due to the\ninteraction of the entangled system with its surroundings. We analyze several\nscenarios, corresponding to different families of states and environments,\nwhich render a diversity of dynamical behaviors.\n  Contrary to single-particle quantities, that typically vanish only\nasymptotically in time, entanglement may disappear at a finite time. Moreover,\nimportant classes of entanglement show an exponential decay with the system\nsize when subject to local noise, posing yet another threat to the already\nchallenging scaling of quantum technologies. Results for the local and global\nnoise cases are summarized. Robustness-enhancement techniques, scaling laws,\nstatistical and geometrical aspects of multipartite-entanglement decay are also\nreviewed; all in order to give a broad picture of entanglement dynamics in open\nquantum systems addressed to both theorists and experimentalists inside and\noutside the field of quantum information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Feb 2014 19:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-03"}

SM running couplings not only\nallow us to extrapolate SM physics up to the Planck scale, but equally\nimportant they are triggering the Higgs mechanism. This is possible by the fact\nthat the bare mass term in the Higgs potential changes sign at about mu_0 =\n1.4x10^16 GeV and in the symmetric phase is enhanced by quadratic terms in the\nPlanck mass. Such a huge Higgs mass term is able to play a key role in\ntriggering inflation in the early universe. In this article we extend our\nprevious investigation by working out the details of a Higgs inflation\nscenario. We show how different terms contributing to the Higgs Lagrangian are\naffecting inflation. Given the SM and its extrapolation to scales mu>mu_0 we\nfind a calculable cosmological constant V(0) which is weakly scale dependent\nand actually remains large during inflation. This is different to the Higgs\nfluctuation field dependent Delta V(phi), which decays exponentially during\ninflation, and actually would not provide a sufficient amount of inflation. The\nfluctuation field has a different effective mass which shifts the bare Higgs\ntransition point to a lower value mu'_0 = 7.7x10^14 GeV. The vacuum energy V(0)\nbeing proportional to M_Pl^4 has a coefficient which vanishes near the Higgs\ntransition point, such that the bare and the renormalized cosmological constant\nmatch at this point.

When the\nglobal solution is hard to attain, statisticians always use the better if there\nare two solutions for chosen, where the word \"better\" is understood in the\nsense of optimization. This seems reasonable in that the better solution is\nmore likely to be the global solution, whose statistical properties of interest\nusually have been well established. From the statistical perspective, we use\nthe better solution because we intuitively believe the principle, called better\nsolution principle (BSP) in this paper, that a better solution to a statistical\noptimization problem also has better statistical properties of interest. BSP\ndisplays some concordance between optimization and statistics, and is expected\nto widely hold. Since theoretical study on BSP seems to be neglected by\nstatisticians, this paper aims to establish a framework for discussing BSP in\nvarious statistical optimization problems. We demonstrate several simple but\neffective comparison theorems as the key results of this paper, and apply them\nto verify BSP in commonly encountered statistical optimization problems,\nincluding maximum likelihood estimation, best subsample selection, and best\nsubset regression. It can be seen that BSP for these problems holds under\nreasonable conditions, i.e., a better solution indeed has better statistical\nproperties of interest.

We deal with regular covers in which this locally\nbijective homomorphism is prescribed by an action of a subgroup of ${\\rm\nAut}(G)$. Regular covers have many applications in constructions and studies of\nbig objects all over mathematics and computer science.\n  We study computational aspects of regular covers that have not been addressed\nbefore. The decision problem RegularCover asks for two given graphs $G$ and $H$\nwhether $G$ regularly covers $H$. When $|H|=1$, this problem becomes Cayley\ngraph recognition for which the complexity is still unresolved. Another special\ncase arises for $|G| = |H|$ when it becomes the graph isomorphism problem.\nTherefore, we restrict ourselves to graph classes with polynomially solvable\ngraph isomorphism.\n  Inspired by Negami, we apply the structural results used by Babai in the\n1970's to study automorphism groups of graphs. Our main result is the following\nFPT meta-algorithm: Let $\\cal C$ be a class of graphs such that the structure\nof automorphism groups of 3-connected graphs in $\\cal C$ is simple.

However, not all\nthe information contained in a pair of continuous trajectories is important and\nthus the need for qualitative descriptions of interaction trajectories arises.\nThe Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) (Van de Weghe, 2004) is a promising\ndevelopment towards this goal. Numerous variants of QTC have been proposed in\nthe past and QTC has been applied towards analyzing various interaction\ndomains. However, an inherent limitation of those QTC variations that deal with\nlateral movements is that they are limited to two-dimensional motion;\ntherefore, complex three-dimensional interactions, such as those occurring\nbetween flying planes or birds, cannot be captured. Towards that purpose, in\nthis paper QTC3Dis presented: a novel qualitative trajectory calculus that can\ndeal with full three-dimensional interactions.

Apart from the theoretical exposition, including definition\nand properties, as well as computational aspects, we also present an\napplication of QTC3D towards modeling bird flight.

We assign a multiplicity to irreducible top dimensional\ncomponents of the singular set of a holomorphic bundle with a filtration by\nsaturated subsheaves. We derive a singular Bott-Chern formula relating the\nsecond Chern form of a smooth metric on the bundle to the Chern current of an\nadmissible metric on the associated graded sheaf. This is used to show that the\nmultiplicities of the top dimensional bubbling locus defined via the Yang-Mills\ndensity agree with the corresponding multiplicities for the\nHarder-Narasimhan-Seshadri filtration. The set theoretic equality of singular\nsets is a consequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2014 15:34:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 16:42:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 18:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

Many algorithmic and implementation techniques have been\ndeveloped, however, theoretical understanding of many aspects of deep neural\nnetworks is far from clear. A particular interesting issue is the usefulness of\ndropout, which was motivated from the intuition of preventing complex\nco-adaptation of feature detectors. In this paper, we study the Rademacher\ncomplexity of different types of dropout, and our theoretical results disclose\nthat for shallow neural networks (with one or none hidden layer) dropout is\nable to reduce the Rademacher complexity in polynomial, whereas for deep neural\nnetworks it can amazingly lead to an exponential reduction of the Rademacher\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2014 15:54:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jul 2014 14:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}
