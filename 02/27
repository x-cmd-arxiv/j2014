In this work the effect of magnetic shear on the growth\nrate of the MRT instability is investigated. The eigenmodes of an interface and\na slab model under the presence of gravity are analytically calculated assuming\nthat the orientation of the magnetic field changes in the equilibrium, i.e.,\nthere is magnetic shear. We solve the linearised magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nequations in the incompressible regime.We find that the growth rate is bounded\nunder the presence of magnetic shear. We have derived simple analytical\nexpressions for the maximum growth rate, corresponding to the most unstable\nmode of the system. These expressions provide the explicit dependence of the\ngrowth rate on the various equilibrium parameters. For small angles the growth\ntime is linearly proportional to the shear angle, and in this regime the single\ninterface problem and the slab problem tend to the same result. On the\ncontrary, in the limit of large angles and for the interface problem the growth\ntime is essentially independent of the shear angle. In this regime we have also\nbeen able to calculate an approximate expression for the growth time for the\nslab configuration. Magnetic shear can have a strong effect on the growth rates\nof the instability. As an application of the results found in this paper we\nhave indirectly determined the shear angle in solar prominence threads using\ntheir lifetimes and the estimation of the Alfv\\'en speed of the structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 16:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Modeling the disk with data obtained\nat different wavelengths has led to a variety of proposed disk structures.\nRather than being inconsistent, the individual models might point to the\ndifferent faces of physical processes going on in disks, such as dust growth\nand planet formation. Our aim is to investigate the structure of the transition\ndisk again and to find to what extent we can reconcile apparent model\ndifferences. A large set of high-angular-resolution data was collected from\nnear-infrared to centimeter wavelengths. We investigated the existing disk\nmodels and established a new self-consistent radiative-transfer model. A\ngenetic fitting algorithm was used to automatize the parameter fitting. Simple\ndisk models with a vertical inner rim and a radially homogeneous dust\ncomposition from small to large grains cannot reproduce the combined data set.\nTwo modifications are applied to this simple disk model: (1) the inner rim is\nsmoothed by exponentially decreasing the surface density in the inner ~3 AU,\nand (2) the largest grains (>100 um) are concentrated towards the inner disk\nregion. Both properties can be linked to fundamental processes that determine\nthe evolution of protoplanetary disks: the shaping by a possible companion and\nthe different regimes of dust-grain growth, respectively. The full\ninterferometric data set from near-infrared to centimeter wavelengths requires\na revision of existing models for the TW Hya disk. We present a new model that\nincorporates the characteristic structures of previous models but deviates in\ntwo key aspects: it does not have a sharp edge at 4 AU, and the surface density\nof large grains differs from that of smaller grains.

First, by the Seismo-Geodetic method using the data\nfrom a three-station micro-array located close to the dam; second, by\nSingle-Station estimates of the displacement gradients. The dynamic\ndeformations obtained from both methods were compared and analyzed in the\ncontext of the local free-field effects.

Though the bounce\nhas been exhibited in various matter models, due to severe computational\nchallenges some important questions have so far remained unaddressed. These\ninclude the demonstration of the bounce for widely spread states, its detailed\nproperties for the states when matter field probes regions close to the Planck\nvolume and the reliability of the continuum effective spacetime description in\ngeneral. In this manuscript we rigorously answer these questions using the\nChimera numerical scheme for the isotropic spatially flat model sourced with a\nmassless scalar field. We show that as expected from an exactly solvable model,\nthe quantum bounce is a generic feature of states even with a very wide spread,\nand for those which bounce much closer to the Planck volume. We perform a\ndetailed analysis of the departures from the effective description and find\nsome expected, and some surprising results. At a coarse level of description,\nthe effective dynamics can be regarded as a good approximation to the\nunderlying quantum dynamics unless the states correspond to small scalar field\nmomenta, in which case they bounce closer to the Planck volume, or are very\nwidely spread. Quantifying the amount of discrepancy between the quantum and\nthe effective dynamics, we find that the departure between them depends in a\nsubtle and non-monotonic way on the field momentum and different fluctuations.\nInterestingly, the departures are generically found to be such that the\neffective dynamics overestimates the spacetime curvature, and underestimates\nthe volume at the bounce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 17:07:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 May 2014 16:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The sensor makes measurements of the process and\nforms estimates of the state using a local Kalman filter. The sensor transmits\nquantized information over a packet dropping link to the remote receiver. The\nreceiver sends packet receipt acknowledgments back to the sensor via an\nerroneous feedback communication channel which is itself packet dropping. The\nkey novelty of this formulation is that the smart sensor decides, at each\ndiscrete time instant, whether to transmit a quantized version of either its\nlocal state estimate or its local innovation. The objective is to design\noptimal transmission policies in order to minimize a long term average cost\nfunction as a convex combination of the receiver's expected estimation error\ncovariance and the energy needed to transmit the packets. The optimal\ntransmission policy is obtained by the use of dynamic programming techniques.\nUsing the concept of submodularity, the optimality of a threshold policy in the\ncase of scalar systems with perfect packet receipt acknowledgments is proved.\nSuboptimal solutions and their structural results are also discussed.

In this model, the incoming pump wave is\ndescribed by either a bunch (for coherent waves) or a sea (for random phase\nwaves) of quasi-particles. A particle-in-cell type code has been developed to\nperform numerical simulations of such interactions using the quasi-particle\napproach. This code allows for a comparatively easy description of both random\nphase and coherent pump pulses coupling to slow electrostatic plasma waves,\nwhile providing an extended range of powerful diagnostics leading to a deeper\nphysical insight into the dynamics of the fast waves. As an example, the\npropagation of short, intense laser pulses through a plasma has been simulated.\nA sample of the phenomena that can be studied for this case includes\nmodulational instabilities, photon wave breaking and turbulence, and pulse\ncompression, stretching, and chirping. The extensibility of the numerical\nimplementation to other types of fast wave-slow wave interactions is also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 19:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-27"}

But this praxis has little philosophical\njustification, since there exist many notions of simplicity, and those that can\nbe defined precisely strongly depend on the language in which the theory is\nformulated. The language dependence is a natural feature - to some extent - but\nit is also believed to be a fatal problem, because, according to a common\ngeneral argument, the simplicity of a theory is always trivial in a suitably\nchosen language. But, this trivialization argument is typically either applied\nto toy-models of scientific theories or applied with little regard for the\nempirical content of the theory. This paper shows that the trivialization\nargument fails, when one considers realistic theories and requires their\nempirical content to be preserved. In fact, the concepts that enable a very\nsimple formulation, are not necessarily measurable, in general. Moreover, the\ninspection of a theory describing a chaotic billiard shows that precisely those\nconcepts that naturally make the theory extremely simple are provably not\nmeasurable. This suggests that - whenever a theory possesses sufficiently\ncomplex consequences - the constraint of measurability prevents too simple\nformulations in any language. This explains why the scientists often regard\ntheir assessments of simplicity as largely unambiguous. In order to reveal a\ncultural bias in the scientists' assessment, one should explicitly identify\ndifferent characterizations of simplicity of the assumptions that lead to\ndifferent theory selections. General arguments are not sufficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 20:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-27"}

This calculation shall consider Feynman diagrams to\norder of one-loop, octet and decuplet intermediaries states. We obtain\ncorrections due to one-loop and perturbative SU(3) symmetry breaking. The first\ncorrections come from Feynman diagrams, then talk about a broken chiral\nsymmetry in the implicit limit $m_q \\rightarrow 0$, where $m_q$ is the quark\nmass and the second corrections are obtained by ignoring isospin breaking and\nin that case the SU(3) symmetry breaking a first-order perturbation is\nincluded, leading an explicit break symmetry. The matrix elements of the\nspatial components of the axial operator between the states of the spin flavor\nsymmetry, give the typical values of the axial vector coupling. For the baryon\noctet, links axial vector are $g_A$, just as they are defined in experiments of\nbaryon semileptonic decays, where $g_A \\approx 1.27$ for neutron beta decay. In\nstrong decays of the baryon axial vector couplings are $g$, which are extracted\nfrom the widths of the strong decays of baryon decuplet to octet of baryons and\npions.

The standard scenario invokes a doublet of nearly\ndegenerate DM states, and a dark force to mediate a large upscattering cross\nsection between the two. For heavy ($\\sim TeV$) DM, the kinetic energy of WIMPs\nin large (galaxy-sized or larger) halos is capable of producing low-energy\npositrons. For lighter dark matter, this is kinematically impossible, and the\nunique observable signature becomes an X-ray line, arising from $\\chi \\chi\n\\rightarrow \\chi^* \\chi^*$, followed by $\\chi^* \\rightarrow \\chi \\gamma$. This\nvariant of XDM is distinctive from other DM X-ray scenarios in that it tends to\nbe most present in more massive, hotter environments, such as clusters, rather\nthan nearby dwarfs, and has different dependencies from decaying models. We\nfind that it is capable of explaining the recently reported X-ray line at 3.56\nkeV. For very long lifetimes of the excited state, primordial decays can\nexplain the signal without the presence of upscattering. Thermal models\nfreeze-out as in the normal XDM setup, via annihilations to the light boson\n$\\phi$.

In this framework, the\nsensor measurements as noisy versions of the system states are sent to the\nreceiver over a packet dropping communication channel. The packet dropout\nprobabilities of the channel depend on both the sensor's transmission energies\nand time varying wireless fading channel gains. The sensor has access to an\nenergy harvesting source which is an everlasting but unreliable energy source\ncompared to conventional batteries with fixed energy storages. The receiver\nperforms optimal state estimation with random packet dropouts to minimize the\nestimation error covariances based on received measurements. The receiver also\nsends packet receipt acknowledgments to the sensor via an erroneous feedback\ncommunication channel which is itself packet dropping.\n  The objective is to design optimal transmission energy allocation at the\nenergy harvesting sensor to minimize either a finite-time horizon sum or a long\nterm average (infinite-time horizon) of the trace of the expected estimation\nerror covariance of the receiver's Kalman filter. These problems are formulated\nas Markov decision processes with imperfect state information. The optimal\ntransmission energy allocation policies are obtained by the use of dynamic\nprogramming techniques. Using the concept of submodularity, the structure of\nthe optimal transmission energy policies are studied. Suboptimal solutions are\nalso discussed which are far less computationally intensive than optimal\nsolutions.

It is harder to self-calibrate\nphotometry when a single occultation is reduced and analyzed in isolation; we\nfind that such measurements have not passed the test of repeatability.\nSingle-eclipse measurements either have an uncertainty floor of 5E-4, or their\nuncertainties have been underestimated by a factor of 3.

Within these maps, we find the GeV excess to be robust and highly\nstatistically significant, with a spectrum, angular distribution, and overall\nnormalization that is in good agreement with that predicted by simple\nannihilating dark matter models. For example, the signal is very well fit by a\n36-51 GeV dark matter particle annihilating to $b\\bar{b}$ with an annihilation\ncross section of $\\sigma v = (1-3)\\times 10^{-26}$ cm$^3$/s (normalized to a\nlocal dark matter density of 0.4 GeV/cm$^3$). Furthermore, we confirm that the\nangular distribution of the excess is approximately spherically symmetric and\ncentered around the dynamical center of the Milky Way (within\n$\\sim$$0.05^{\\circ}$ of Sgr A$^*$), showing no sign of elongation along the\nGalactic Plane. The signal is observed to extend to at least $\\simeq10^{\\circ}$\nfrom the Galactic Center, disfavoring the possibility that this emission\noriginates from millisecond pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 21:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2015 22:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

The measurement of rh for the major fraction of the NGC1399 GC\nsystem reveals a trend of increasing rh versus galactocentric distance, Rgal,\nout to about 10 kpc and a flat relation beyond.

Modeling the mass density profile of\nNGC1399 shows that additional external dynamical mechanisms are required to\nlimit the GC size in the galaxy halo regions to rh~2 pc. We suggest that this\nmay be realized by an exotic GC orbit distribution function, an extended dark\nmatter halo, and/or tidal stress induced by the increased stochasticity in the\ndwarf halo substructure at larger Rgal.

Recently, synthetic gauge fields have been realized\nexperimentally in neutral cold atom systems, giving rise to a spin-orbit\ncoupling term with \"strength\" $k_{\\text{so}}$. This paper investigates the\ninterplay between the single-particle spin-orbit coupling term of Rashba type\nand the short-range two-body $s$-wave interaction for cold atoms under external\nconfinement. Specifically, we consider two different harmonically trapped\ntwo-atom systems. The first system consists of an atom with spin-orbit coupling\nthat interacts with a structureless particle through a short-range two-body\npotential. The second system consists of two atoms that both feel the\nspin-orbit coupling term and that interact through a short-range two-body\npotential. Treating the spin-orbit term perturbatively, we determine the\ncorrection to the ground state energy for various generic parameter\ncombinations. Selected excited states are also treated. An important aspect of\nour study is that the perturbative treatment is not limited to small $s$-wave\nscattering lengths but provides insights into the system behavior over a wide\nrange of scattering lengths, including the strongly-interacting unitary regime.\nOur perturbative results are confirmed by numerical calculations that expand\nthe eigenfunctions of the two-particle Hamiltonian in terms of basis functions\nthat contain explicitly correlated Gaussians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 22:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The velocity width containing 90% of line power ranges from 370 to\n4780 km/sec, suggesting outflow velocities up to 2000 km/sec. The velocity\nwidth of the [OIII] emission is positively correlated with the radio luminosity\namong the radio-quiet quasars.

The Fermi velocity is\nincreased by one order of magnitude, as the Dirac point is moved from Brillouin\nzone boundary to Brillouin zone center and the real-space distribution of Dirac\nstates are made twice more delocalized. These intriguing changes are explained\nby an orbital filtering effect of edge H atoms, which removes certain\ncomponents of $p$ orbits of edge Bi atoms that reshapes the topological edge\nstates. In addition, the spin texture of the Dirac states is also modified,\nwhich is described by introducing an effective Hamiltonian.

In the 6-dimensional SU(3) model,\nhowever, a suitable orbifolding is known to lead to a mass of the order of\n$M_{W}$: $M_{H} = 2M_{W}$ at the tree level, which has some similarity to the\ncorresponding prediction by the MSSM, $M_{H}$ leq (cos beta) $M_{Z}$.

It is\ntheoretically well known that the codebook size for CSI quantization should be\nincreased as the number of transmit antennas becomes larger, and 3GPP long term\nevolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced codebooks also follow this trend. Thus, in\nmassive MIMO, it is hard to apply the conventional approach of using\npre-defined vector-quantized codebooks for CSI quantization mainly because of\ncodeword search complexity. In this paper, we propose a trellis-extended\ncodebook (TEC) that can be easily harmonized with current wireless standards\nsuch as LTE or LTE-Advanced by extending standardized codebooks designed for 2,\n4, or 8 antennas with trellis structures. TEC exploits a Viterbi decoder and\nconvolutional encoder in channel coding as the CSI quantizer and the CSI\nreconstructer, respectively. By quantizing multiple channel entries\nsimultaneously using standardized codebooks in a state transition of trellis\nsearch, TEC can achieve fractional bits per channel entry quantization to have\na practical feedback overhead. Thus, TEC can solve both the complexity and the\nfeedback overhead issues of CSI quantization in massive MIMO systems. We also\ndevelop trellis-extended successive phase adjustment (TE-SPA) which works as a\ndifferential codebook of TEC. This is similar to the dual codebook concept of\nLTE-Advanced. TE-SPA can reduce CSI quantization error even with lower feedback\noverhead in temporally correlated channels. Numerical results verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed schemes in FDD massive MIMO systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2014 06:19:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 00:38:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 04:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

We argue, contrary to the above mentioned traditional view, that\ndiverging fluctuations in real physical systems near a critical point are\ngenuine consequence of the breakdown of the property of statistical\nindependence, and are faithfully reproduced by the mean-field theory. By\nlooking at the problem from the point of view of \"statistical independence\" the\ndivergence of fluctuations in real physical systems near criticality becomes\nimmediately apparent as a connection can be established between diverging\ncorrelation length and diverging fluctuations.

Many of these states are gapped and\nexhibit anyon excitations, which could be used for a robust form of quantum\ninformation processing. However, while numerous qubit array proposals exist to\nengineer the Hamiltonian for these systems, the question of how to stabilize\nthe many-body ground state of these photonic quantum simulators against photon\nlosses remains largely unanswered. We here propose a simple mechanism which\nachieves this goal for abelian and non-abelian fractional quantum Hall states\nof light. Our construction uses a uniform two-photon drive field to couple the\nqubits of the primary lattice with an auxiliary ``shadow\" lattice, composed of\nqubits with a much faster loss rate than the qubits of the primary quantum\nsimulator itself. This coupling causes hole states created by photon losses to\nbe rapidly refilled, and the system's many-body gap prevents further photons\nfrom being added once the strongly correlated ground state is reached. The\nfractional quantum Hall state (with a small, transient population of quasihole\nexcitations) is thus the most stable state of the system, and all other\nconfigurations will relax toward it over time. The physics described here could\nbe implemented in a circuit QED architecture, and the device parameters needed\nfor our scheme to succeed are in reach of current technology. We also propose a\nsimple 6 qubit device, which could easily be built in the near future, that can\nact as a proof of principle for our scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2014 10:14:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 18:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-10"}

Above a certain column density\nthreshold, atomic hydrogen turns molecular. We analyse gas and dust properties\nof intermediate-velocity clouds (IVCs) in the lower galactic halo to explore\ntheir transition from the atomic to the molecular phase. Driven by\nobservations, we investigate the physical processes that transform a purely\natomic IVC into a molecular one. Data from the Effelsberg-Bonn HI-Survey\n(EBHIS) are correlated to FIR wavebands of the Planck satellite and IRIS.\nModified black-body emission spectra are fitted to deduce dust optical depths\nand grain temperatures. We remove the contribution of atomic hydrogen to the\nFIR intensity to estimate molecular hydrogen column densities. Two IVCs show\ndifferent FIR properties, despite their similarity in HI, such as narrow\nspectral lines and large column densities. One FIR bright IVC is associated\nwith H$_{2}$, confirmed by $^{12}$CO $(1\\rightarrow0)$ emission; the other IVC\nis FIR dim and shows no FIR excess, which indicates the absence of molecular\nhydrogen. We propose that the FIR dim and bright IVCs probe the transition\nbetween the atomic and molecular gas phase. Triggered by dynamical processes,\nthis transition happens during the descent of IVCs onto the galactic disk. The\nmost natural driver is ram pressure exerted onto the cloud by the increasing\nhalo density. Because of the enhanced pressure, the formation timescale of\nH$_{2}$ is reduced, allowing the formation of large amounts of H$_{2}$ within a\nfew Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2014 10:21:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

These relations\nemerge out of the symmetries of the angular distribution. We discuss the\nimplications of these relations under the (testable) hypotheses of no scalar or\ntensor contributions and no New Physics weak phases in the Wilson coefficients.\nUnder these hypotheses there is a direct relation among the observables\n$P_{1}$,$P_2$ and $P_{4,5}^\\prime$. This can be used as an independent\nconsistency test of the measurements of the angular observables. Alternatively,\nthese relations can be applied directly in the fit to data, reducing the number\nof free parameters in the fit. This opens up the possibility to perform a full\nangular fit of the observables with existing datasets. An important consequence\nof the found relations is that a priori two different measurements, namely the\nmeasured position of the zero ($q_0^2$) of the forward-backward asymmetry\n$A_{FB}$ and the value of $P_5^\\prime$ evaluated at this same point, are\nrelated by $P_4^2(q_0^{2})+P_5^2(q_0^{2})=1$.

In this paper, we present a robust and\ncomputationally efficient algorithm for removing power line interference from\nneural recordings. The algorithm includes four steps. First, an adaptive notch\nfilter is used to estimate the fundamental frequency of the interference.\nSubsequently, based on the estimated frequency, harmonics are generated by\nusing discrete-time oscillators, and then the amplitude and phase of each\nharmonic are estimated through using a modified recursive least squares\nalgorithm. Finally, the estimated interference is subtracted from the recorded\ndata. The algorithm does not require any reference signal, and can track the\nfrequency, phase, and amplitude of each harmonic. When benchmarked with other\npopular approaches, our algorithm performs better in terms of noise immunity,\nconvergence speed, and output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While minimally\naffecting the signal bands of interest, the algorithm consistently yields fast\nconvergence and substantial interference rejection in different conditions of\ninterference strengths (input SNR from -30 dB to 30 dB), power line frequencies\n(45-65 Hz), and phase and amplitude drifts. In addition, the algorithm features\na straightforward parameter adjustment since the parameters are independent of\nthe input SNR, input signal power, and the sampling rate. The proposed\nalgorithm features a highly robust operation, fast adaptation to interference\nvariations, significant SNR improvement, low computational complexity and\nmemory requirement, and straightforward parameter adjustment.

In this article, we\nintroduce several new signed network analysis methods that exploit structural\nbalance for measuring partial balance, for finding communities of people based\non balance, for drawing signed social networks, and for solving the problem of\nlink prediction.

The method is by\nconstruction locally and globally conservative. The scheme is based on a\none-step predictor-corrector methodology in space-time and uses three main\nbuilding blocks: First, a high order piecewise polynomial WENO reconstruction,\nto obtain a high order data representation in space from the known cell\naverages of the underlying finite volume scheme. Second, a high order\nspace-time Galerkin predictor step based on a weak formulation of the governing\nPDE on moving control volumes. Third, a high order one-step finite volume\nscheme, based directly on the integral formulation of the conservation law in\nspace-time. The algorithm being entirely based on space-time control volumes\nnaturally allows for hanging nodes also in time, hence in this framework the\nimplementation of a consistent and conservative time-accurate LTS becomes very\nnatural and simple. The method is validated on some classical shock tube\nproblems for the Euler equations of compressible gasdynamics and the\nmagnetohydrodynamics equations (MHD). The performance of the new scheme is\ncompared with a classical high order ALE finite volume scheme based on global\ntime stepping.

K-means algorithm is a widely used partition method in\nclustering. However, it is known that the K-means algorithm may get stuck at\nsuboptimal solutions, depending on the choice of the initial cluster centers.\nIn this article, we propose a technique to handle large scale data, which can\nselect initial clustering center purposefully using Genetic algorithms (GAs),\nreduce the sensitivity to isolated point, avoid dissevering big cluster, and\novercome deflexion of data in some degree that caused by the disproportion in\ndata partitioning owing to adoption of multi-sampling. We applied our method to\nsome public datasets these show the advantages of the proposed approach for\nexample Hepatitis C dataset that has been taken from the machine learning\nwarehouse of University of California. Our aim is to evaluate hepatitis\ndataset. In order to evaluate this dataset we did some preprocessing operation,\nthe reason to preprocessing is to summarize the data in the best and suitable\nway for our algorithm. Missing values of the instances are adjusted using local\nmean method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2014 11:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-26"}
