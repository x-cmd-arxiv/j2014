This leads to an equation for the vorticity distribution that conserves\nall the Casimirs, the energy, and that increases monotonically the mixing\nentropy ($H$-theorem). Furthermore, the equation for the coarse-grained\nvorticity dissipates monotonically all the generalized enstrophies. These\nequations may provide a parametrization of 2D turbulence. They do not generally\nrelax towards the maximum entropy state. The vorticity current vanishes for any\nsteady state of the 2D Euler equation. Interestingly, the equation for the\ncoarse-grained vorticity obtained from the MEPP turns out to coincide, after\nsome algebraic manipulations, with the one obtained with the anticipated\nvorticity method. This shows a connection between these two approaches when the\nconservation of energy is treated locally.

The basic idea is to transform the\ncoefficients of material equations, namely the dielectric permittivity and\nmagnetic permeability in the effective geometry of space-time (besides the\nvacuum Maxwell equations). This allows us to solve the direct and inverse\nproblems, that is, to find the permittivity and magnetic permeability for a\ngiven effective geometry (paths of rays), as well as finding an effective\ngeometry on the dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability. The most\npopular naive geometrization was proposed by J. Plebanski. Under certain\nlimitations it is quite good for solving relevant problems. It should be noted\nthat in his paper only the resulting formulas and exclusively for Cartesian\ncoordinate systems are given. In our work we conducted a detailed derivation of\nformulas for the naive geometrization of Maxwell's equations, and these\nformulas are written for an arbitrary curvilinear coordinate system. This work\nis a step toward building a complete covariant geometrization of the\nmacroscopic Maxwell's equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2014 17:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-25"}

The majority of sample\ngalaxies are known to have dust in various forms viz. dust lanes, nuclear dust\nand patchy/filamentary dust. A detailed study of dust was performed for 12\ngalaxies with prominent dust features. The extinction curves for these galaxies\nrun parallel to the Galactic extinction curve, implying that the properties of\ndust in these galaxies are similar to those of the Milky-Way. The ratio of\ntotal to selective extinction (Rv) varies between 2.1 and 3.8, with an average\nof 2.9 +/- 0.2, fairly close to its canonical value of 3.1 for our Galaxy. The\naverage relative grain size <a>/a_Gal of dust particles in these galaxies turns\nout to be 1.01 +/- 0.2, while dust mass estimated using optical extinction lies\nin the range 10^2 to 10^4 M(sun) . The Halpha emission was detected in 23 out\nof 29 galaxies imaged through narrow- band filters with the Halpha luminosities\nin the range 10^38 - 10^41 erg s^-1. The mass of the ionized gas is in the\nrange 10^3-10^5 M(sun). The morphology and extent of ionized gas is found\nsimilar to those of dust, indicating possible coexistence of dust and ionized\ngas in these galaxies. The absence of any apparent correlation between blue\nluminosity and normalized IRAS dust mass is suggestive of merger related origin\nof dust and gas in these galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2014 19:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

With increasing Mn concentration, the\ncrystal structure changes from the tetradymite structure of the Bi2Te3 parent\ncrystal at low Mn concentrations towards a BiTe phase in the (Bi2Te3)m(Bi2)n\nhomologous series. Magnetization measurements reveal the onset of\nferromagnetism with a Curie temperature in the range 13.8 K - 17 K in films\nwith 2 % - 10 % Mn concentration. Magnetization hysteresis loops reveal that\nthe magnetic easy axis is along the c-axis of the crystal (perpendicular to the\nplane). Polarized neutron reflectivity measurements of a 68 nm-thick sample\nshow that the magnetization is uniform through the film. The presence of\nferromagnetism is also manifest in a strong anomalous Hall effect and a\nhysteretic magnetoresistance arising from domain wall scattering. Ordinary Hall\neffect measurements show that the carrier density is n-type, increases with Mn\ndoping, and is high enough (> 2.8 x 10^{13} cm^{-2}) to place the chemical\npotential in the conduction band. Thus, the observed ferromagnetism is likely\nassociated with both bulk and surface states. Surprisingly, the Curie\ntemperature does not show any clear dependence on the carrier density but does\nincrease with Mn concentration. Our results suggest that the ferromagnetism\nprobed in these Mn-doped Bi2Te3 films is not mediated by carriers in the\nconduction band or in an impurity band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2014 19:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-28"}

Recent\nadvances in nonlinear metric learning have demonstrated the potential power of\nnon-Mahalanobis distance functions, particularly tree-based functions. We\npropose a novel nonlinear metric learning method that uses an iterative,\nhierarchical variant of semi-supervised max-margin clustering to construct a\nforest of cluster hierarchies, where each individual hierarchy can be\ninterpreted as a weak metric over the data. By introducing randomness during\nhierarchy training and combining the output of many of the resulting\nsemi-random weak hierarchy metrics, we can obtain a powerful and robust\nnonlinear metric model. This method has two primary contributions: first, it is\nsemi-supervised, incorporating information from both constrained and\nunconstrained points. Second, we take a relaxed approach to constraint\nsatisfaction, allowing the method to satisfy different subsets of the\nconstraints at different levels of the hierarchy rather than attempting to\nsimultaneously satisfy all of them. This leads to a more robust learning\nalgorithm. We compare our method to a number of state-of-the-art benchmarks on\n$k$-nearest neighbor classification, large-scale image retrieval and\nsemi-supervised clustering problems, and find that our algorithm yields results\ncomparable or superior to the state-of-the-art, and is significantly more\nrobust to noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2014 00:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-25"}

Bubble N107 was discovered in the infrared emission of dust in the\nGalactic Plane observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope (GLIMPSE survey: l ~\n51.0 deg, b ~ 0.1 deg). The bubble represents an example of shell-like\nstructures found all over the Milky Way Galaxy.\n  Aims. We aim to analyse the atomic and molecular components of N107, as well\nas its radio continuum emission. With the help of numerical simulations, we aim\nto estimate the bubble age and other parameters which cannot be derived\ndirectly from observations.\n  Methods. From the observations of the HI (I-GALFA) and 13CO (GRS) lines we\nderive the bubble's kinematical distance and masses of the atomic and molecular\ncomponents. With the algorithm DENDROFIND, we decompose molecular material into\nindividual clumps. From the continuum observations at 1420 MHz (VGPS) and 327\nMHz (WSRT), we derive the radio flux density and the spectral index. With the\nnumerical code ring, we simulate the evolution of stellar-blown bubbles similar\nto N107.\n  Results. The total HI mass associated with N107 is 5.4E3 Msun. The total mass\nof the molecular component (a mixture of cold gasses of H2, CO, He and heavier\nelements) is 1.3E5 Msun, from which 4.0E4 Msun is found along the bubble\nborder. We identified 49 molecular clumps distributed along the bubble border,\nwith the slope of the clump mass function of -1.1. The spectral index of -0.30\nof a strong radio source located apparently within the bubble indicates\nnonthermal emission, hence part of the flux likely originates in a supernova\nremnant, not yet catalogued. The numerical simulations suggest N107 is likely\nless than 2.25 Myr old. Since first supernovae explode only after 3 Myr or\nlater, no supernova remnant should be present within the bubble.

Under the labeling $f$, the label of a\nvertex $v$ is $f(v)$, and the induced label of an edge $uv$ is $|f(u) - f(v)|$.\nThe labeling $f$ is graceful if the labels of the vertices are $\\{0, 1, \\ldots\n, |V(G)| - 1\\}$, and the induced labels of the edges are distinct. The graph\n$G$ is graceful if it has a graceful labeling. The Graceful Tree Conjecture,\nintroduced by Kotzig in the late 1960's, states that all trees are graceful. It\nis an open problem whether every diameter-6 tree has a graceful labeling. In\nthis paper, we prove that if $T$ is a tree with central vertex and root $v$,\nsuch that each vertex not in the last two levels has an odd number of children,\nand $T$ satisfies one of the following conditions (a)-(e), then $T$ has a\ngraceful labeling $f$ with $f(v) = 0$: (a) $T$ is a diameter-6 complete tree;\n(b) $T$ is a diameter-6 tree such that no two leaves of distance 2 from $v$ are\nsiblings, and each leaf of distance 2 from $v$ has a sibling with an even\nnumber of children; (c) $T$ is a diameter-$2r$ complete tree, such that the\nnumber of vertices of distance $r - 1$ from $v$, with an even number of\nchildren, is not $3\\pmod{4}$; (d) $T$ is a diameter-$2r$ tree, such that the\nnumber of vertices of distance $r - 1$ from $v$, with an even number of\nchildren, is not $3\\pmod{4}$, no two leaves of distance $r - 1$ from $v$ are\nsiblings, and each leaf of distance $r - 1$ from $v$ has a sibling with an even\nnumber of children; (e) $T$ is a diameter-6 tree, such that each internal\nvertex has an odd number of children.

For this reason, many approaches have been developed to best\nestimate the cardiac muscle deformation, and to obtain a practical model to use\nin diagnostic procedures. But there are some conditions, like in case of\nmyocardial infarction, in which the regular modeling approaches are not useful.\nIn this section, using a point-wise approach in deformation estimation, we try\nto estimate the deformation under some abnormal conditions of cardiac muscle.\nFirst, the endocardial and epicardial contour points are ordered with respect\nto the center of gravity of endocardial contour and boundary point displacement\nvectors are extracted. Then to solve the governing equation of deformation,\nwhich is an elliptic equation, we apply boundary conditions in accordance with\nthe computed displacement vectors and then the Finite Element method (FEM) will\nbe used to solve the governing equation. Using obtained displacement field\nthrough the cardiac muscle, strain map is extracted to show the mechanical\nbehavior of cardiac muscle. To validate the proposed algorithm in case of\ninfracted muscle, a non-homogeneous ring is modeled using ANSYS under a uniform\ntime varying internal pressure, which is the case in real cardiac muscle\ndeformation and then the proposed algorithm implemented in MATLAB and the\nresults for such problem are extracted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Feb 2014 00:14:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Dec 2014 01:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-09"}
