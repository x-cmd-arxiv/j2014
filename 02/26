The system of strongly coupled parabolic\nequations for particle density and spin density vector describes the\nspin-polarized semi-classical electron transport in ferromagnetic\nsemiconductors. The presence of a nonconstant and nonsmooth magnetization\nvector, solution of the Landau-Lifshitz equation, causes the diffusion matrix\nto be dependent from space and time and to have in general poor regularity\nproperties, thus making the analysis challenging. To partially overcome the\nanalytical difficulties the velocity saturation hypothesis is made, which\nresults in a bounded drift velocity. The global-in-time existence and\nuniqueness of weak solutions is shown by means of a semi-discretization in\ntime, which yields an elliptic semilinear problem, and a quadratic entropy\ninequality, which allow for the limit of vanishing time step size. The\nconvergence of the weak solutions to the steady state, under some restrictions\non the parameters and data, is shown.

In many domains such as movies, news or\nelectronic commerce recommenders, considerable contextual data in text form\ndescribing item properties is available along with the rating data, which could\nbe utilized to improve recommendation quality.In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach to improve standard CF based recommenders by utilizing latent\nDirichlet allocation (LDA) to learn latent properties of items, expressed in\nterms of topic proportions, derived from their textual description. We infer\nuser's topic preferences or persona in the same latent space,based on her\nhistorical ratings. While computing similarity between users, we make use of a\ncombined similarity measure involving rating overlap as well as similarity in\nthe latent topic space. This approach alleviates sparsity problem as it allows\ncalculation of similarity between users even if they have not rated any items\nin common. Our experiments on multiple public datasets indicate that the\nproposed hybrid approach significantly outperforms standard user Based and item\nBased CF recommenders in terms of classification accuracy metrics such as\nprecision, recall and f-measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 16:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

Previous work relied on simple suboptimal counting rules for\ndecision fusion in order to avoid the exhaustive numerical search required for\nobtaining the optimal thresholds. However, these simple rules are not globally\noptimal as they do not maximize the overall global detection probability by\njointly selecting local and global thresholds. Instead, they maximize the\ndetection probability for a specific global threshold. In this paper, a\nglobally optimal decision fusion rule for Primary User signal detection based\non the Neyman- Pearson (NP) criterion is derived. The algorithm is based on a\nnovel representation for the global performance metrics in terms of the\nregularized incomplete beta function. Based on this mathematical\nrepresentation, it is shown that the globally optimal NP hard decision fusion\ntest can be put in the form of a conventional one dimensional convex\noptimization problem. A binary search for the global threshold can be applied\nyielding a complexity of O(log2(N)), where N represents the number of\ncooperating users. The logarithmic complexity is appreciated because we are\nconcerned with dense networks, and thus N is expected to be large. The proposed\noptimal scheme outperforms conventional counting rules, such as the OR, AND,\nand MAJORITY rules. It is shown via simulations that, although the optimal rule\ntends to the simple OR rule when the number of cooperating secondary users is\nsmall, it offers significant SNR gain in dense cognitive radio networks with\nlarge number of cooperating users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 17:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

The\nEOB model predicts quasiuniversal relations between the mass-rescaled\ngravitational wave frequency and the binding energy at the moment of merger,\nand certain dimensionless binary tidal coupling constants depending on the\nstars Love numbers, compactnesses and the binary mass ratio. These relations\nare quasiuniversal in the sense that, for a given value of the tidal coupling\nconstant, they depend significantly neither on the equation of state nor on the\nmass ratio, though they do depend on stars spins. The spin dependence is\napproximately linear for small spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum.\nThe quasiuniversality is a property of the conservative dynamics; nontrivial\nrelations emerge as the binary interaction becomes tidally dominated. This\nanalytical prediction is qualitatively consistent with new, multi-orbit\nnumerical relativity results for the relevant case of equal-mass irrotational\nbinaries. Universal relations are thus expected to characterize neutron star\nmergers dynamics.

The transmitter performance at\nthe dynamic control was verified in experiments with CW, S-Band, 1 kW\nmagnetrons. The wideband control of magnetrons, required for the\nsuperconducting linacs, was realized using the magnetrons, injection-locked by\nthe phase-modulated signals. The capabilities of the magnetrons\ninjection-locked by the phase-modulated signals and adequateness for feeding of\nSRF cavities were verified by measurements of the transfer function magnitude\ncharacteristics of single and 2-cascade magnetrons, by measurements the\nmagnetrons phase performance and by measurements of spectra of the carrier\nfrequency. At the ratio of power of locking signal to output power less than\n-13 dB (in 2-cascade scheme per magnetron, respectively) we demonstrated a\nphase modulation bandwidth of over 1.0 MHz. The carrier frequency spectrum\nwidth about of 1 Hz at the level less than -60 dBc did not demonstrate\nbroadening at wide range of magnitude and frequency of the phase modulation of\nthe injection-locking signal. The wideband dynamic control of output power of\nthe transmitter model was first experimentally demonstrated using two\nmagnetrons, combined in power and injection-locked by the phase-modulated\nsignals. The experiments with the injection-locked magnetrons adequately\nemulated the wideband dynamic control with a feedback control system, which\nwill allow suppressing all known parasitic modulation of the accelerating field\nin the SRF cavities. The magnetron transmitter concept, tests of the setups and\ninjection-locking of magnetrons by phase-modulated signals are discussed in\nthis work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 17:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The following LSCO\nand LCMO layers adopt a nearly balanced state in which the tensile and\ncompressive strain effects yield alternating in-plane lattice parameters with\nan almost constant average value. No major defects are observed in the LSCO\nlayers, while a significant number of vertical antiphase boundaries are found\nin the LCMO layers. The LSCO layers remain superconducting with a relatively\nhigh superconducting onset temperature of about 36 K. The macroscopic\nsuperconducting response is also evident in the magnetization data due to a\nweak diamagnetic signal below 10 K for H || ab and a sizeable paramagnetic\nshift for H || c that can be explained in terms of a vortex-pinning-induced\nflux compression. The LCMO layers maintain a strongly ferromagnetic state with\na Curie temperature of about 190 K and a large low-temperature saturation\nmoment of about 3.5(1) muB.

The above-mentioned tradition is concluded to be based\nmainly on principles (rules) of additivity, transferability and locality of\nmolecular properties. Accordingly, model Hamiltonian matrices are used in the\napproaches under development (called quasi-classical alternatives), wherein\nalgebraic parameters play the role of matrix elements and these are assumed to\nbe transferable for similar atoms and/or atomic orbitals in addition. Further,\npassing to delocalized descriptions of electronic structures (as usual) is\nexpected to be the main origin of difficulties seeking to formulate\nquasi-classical alternatives. In the framework of the canonical method of\nmolecular orbitals (MOs), delocalization is shown to be partially avoidable by\ninvoking a recently-suggested approach to secular (eigenvalue) equations for\nmodel Hamiltonian matrices, wherein the usual initial imposing of the\nzero-determinant condition is replaced by a certain reformulation of the\nproblem itself. The most efficient way of achieving the same end, however, is\nshown to consist in passing to non-canonical one-electron problems. The latter\nmay be exemplified by the block-diagonalization problem for the relevant\nHamiltonian matrix following from the Brillouin theorem and yielding\nnon-canonical (localized) MOs and by the commutation equation for the\nrespective one-electron density matrix (charge- bond order matrix). In this\nconnection, most of attention is paid in the article to perturbative solutions\nof the above-mentioned non-canonical problems and to their implications,\nincluding common quantum-chemical descriptions of entire classes of chemical\ncompounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 18:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

Differential privacy is a strong and\nwell-studied notion of privacy introduced by Dwork et al.

Sample complexity of private\nPAC and agnostic learning was studied in a number of prior works starting with\n(Kasiviswanathan et al., 2008) but a number of basic questions still remain\nopen, most notably whether learning with privacy requires more samples than\nlearning without privacy.\n  We show that the sample complexity of learning with (pure) differential\nprivacy can be arbitrarily higher than the sample complexity of learning\nwithout the privacy constraint or the sample complexity of learning with\napproximate differential privacy. Our second contribution and the main tool is\nan equivalence between the sample complexity of (pure) differentially private\nlearning of a concept class $C$ (or $SCDP(C)$) and the randomized one-way\ncommunication complexity of the evaluation problem for concepts from $C$.

This expectation value depends upon the presence of\nlower frequency quanta, the background field, and modifies the effective index\nof refraction, and hence the speed of the probe pulse. If the mean squared\nelectric field is positive, then the pulse is slowed, which is analogous to the\ngravitational effects of ordinary matter. Such matter satisfies the null energy\ncondition and produce gravitational lensing and time delay. If the mean squared\nfield is negative, then the pulse has a higher speed than in the absence of the\nbackground field. This is analogous to the gravitational effects of exotic\nmatter, such as stress tensor expectation values with locally negative energy\ndensities, which lead to repulsive gravitational effects, such as defocussing\nand time advance.

The goal is to compute the\nsmallest positive eigenvalues, and the main challenge is that the coefficient\nmatrix in the discrete Maxwell equation is indefinite and degenerate. To\novercome this difficulty, we derive a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the\ndiscrete single-curl operator and then explicitly express the basis of the\ninvariant subspace corresponding to the nonzero eigenvalues of the GEP.\nConsequently, we reduce the GEP to a null space free standard eigenvalue\nproblem (NFSEP) that contains only the nonzero (complex) eigenvalues of the GEP\nand can be solved by the shift-and-invert Arnoldi method without being\ndisturbed by the null space. Furthermore, the basis of the eigendecomposition\nis chosen carefully so that we can apply fast Fourier transformation\n(FFT)-based matrix vector multiplication to solve the embedded linear systems\nefficiently by an iterative method. For chiral and pseudochiral complex media,\nwhich are of great interest in magnetoelectric applications, the NFSEP can be\nfurther transformed to a null space free generalized eigenvalue problem whose\ncoefficient matrices are Hermitian and Hermitian positive definite\n(HHPD-NFGEP). This HHPD-NFGEP can be solved by using the invert Lanczos method\nwithout shifting. Furthermore, the embedded linear system can be solved\nefficiently by using the conjugate gradient method without preconditioning and\nthe FFT-based matrix vector multiplications. Numerical results are presented to\ndemonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 20:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-26"}

I introduce a new approximate-Bayesian method for\ncomparative phylogeographical model-choice that estimates the temporal\ndistribution of divergences across taxa from multi-locus DNA sequence data. The\nmodel is an extension of that implemented in msBayes. By reparameterizing the\nmodel, introducing more flexible priors on demographic and divergence-time\nparameters, and implementing a non-parametric Dirichlet-process prior over\ndivergence models, I improved the robustness, accuracy, and power of the method\nfor estimating shared evolutionary history across taxa. The results demonstrate\nthe improved performance of the new method is due to (1) more appropriate\npriors on divergence-time and demographic parameters that avoid prohibitively\nsmall marginal likelihoods for models with more divergence events, and (2) the\nDirichlet-process providing a flexible prior on divergence histories that does\nnot strongly disfavor models with intermediate numbers of divergence events.\nThe new method yields more robust estimates of posterior uncertainty, and thus\ngreatly reduces the tendency to incorrectly estimate models of shared\nevolutionary history with strong support.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 20:29:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 00:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-11"}

This task is\ngenerally not achievable without restricting the class of sources over which\nuniversality is desired. Building on our prior work, we propose natural\nfamilies of sources characterized by a common dominating envelope. We\nparticularly emphasize the notion of adaptivity, which is the ability to\nperform as well as an oracle knowing the envelope, without actually knowing it.\nThis is closely related to the notion of hierarchical universal source coding,\nbut with the important difference that families of envelope classes are not\ndiscretely indexed and not necessarily nested.\n  Our contribution is to extend the classes of envelopes over which adaptive\nuniversal source coding is possible, namely by including max-stable\n(heavy-tailed) envelopes which are excellent models in many applications, such\nas natural language modeling. We derive a minimax lower bound on the redundancy\nof any code on such envelope classes, including an oracle that knows the\nenvelope. We then propose a constructive code that does not use knowledge of\nthe envelope. The code is computationally efficient and is structured to use an\n{E}xpanding {T}hreshold for {A}uto-{C}ensoring, and we therefore dub it the\n\\textsc{ETAC}-code. We prove that the \\textsc{ETAC}-code achieves the lower\nbound on the minimax redundancy within a factor logarithmic in the sequence\nlength, and can be therefore qualified as a near-adaptive code over families of\nheavy-tailed envelopes. For finite and light-tailed envelopes the penalty is\neven less, and the same code follows closely previous results that explicitly\nmade the light-tailed assumption.

Cancer genomics demonstrates that these few 'driver'\nmutations occur alongside thousands of random 'passenger' mutations-a natural\nconsequence of cancer's elevated mutation rate. Some passengers can be\ndeleterious to cancer cells, yet have been largely ignored in cancer research.\nIn population genetics, however, the accumulation of mildly deleterious\nmutations has been shown to cause population meltdown. Here we develop a\nstochastic population model where beneficial drivers engage in a tug-of-war\nwith frequent mildly deleterious passengers.

The\nmacroscopic (homogenized) equation is derived as another stochastic partial\ndifferential equation, defined in the whole non perforated domain. Here, the\ninitial stochastic perturbation on the boundary becomes part of the homogenized\nequation as another stochastic force. We use the two-scale convergence method\nafter extending the solution with 0 in the wholes to pass to the limit.

For large underlayer thickness films in\nwhich the effective field saturates, we find that the temperature significantly\ninfluences the size of the effective field. A striking difference is found in\nthe temperature dependence of the two components: the damping-like term\ndecreases whereas the field-like term increases with increasing temperature.\nUsing a simple spin diffusion-spin transfer model, we find that all of these\nresults can be accounted for provided the real and imaginary parts of an\neffective spin mixing conductance are negative. These results imply that either\nspin transport in this system is different from conventional metallic\ninterfaces or effects other spin diffusion into the magnetic layer need to be\ntaken account in order to model the system accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 01:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

By\nexploiting bit-level parallelism, they can significantly accelerate queries.\nHowever, they can use much memory, and thus we might prefer compressed bitmap\nindexes. Following Oracle's lead, bitmaps are often compressed using run-length\nencoding (RLE). Building on prior work, we introduce the Roaring compressed\nbitmap format: it uses packed arrays for compression instead of RLE. We compare\nit to two high-performance RLE-based bitmap encoding techniques: WAH (Word\nAligned Hybrid compression scheme) and Concise (Compressed `n' Composable\nInteger Set). On synthetic and real data, we find that Roaring bitmaps (1)\noften compress significantly better (e.g., 2 times) and (2) are faster than the\ncompressed alternatives (up to 900 times faster for intersections).

The results show that dense\nmmWave networks can achieve comparable coverage and much higher data rates than\nconventional UHF cellular systems, despite the presence of blockages.

Such\nphases, although having a metallic bulk, still possess edge states with\nwell-defined topological invariants. Specifically, we show that with preserved\ntime reversal symmetry, the system can exhibit a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-metallic phase\nwith spin helical edge states and a nontrivial $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant. When\ntime reversal symmetry is broken, a Chern metallic phase could appear with\nchiral edge states and a nontrivial Chern invariant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 11:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-15"}

The advent of\ntime- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES) experiments has\nmade it possible to track the decay of the temperature of the excited hot\nelectrons in selected states in the Brillouin zone, and to reveal their cooling\nin unprecedented detail in a variety of emerging materials. It is, however, not\na straightforward task to determine the temperature with high accuracy. This is\nmainly attributable to an a priori unknown position of the Fermi level and the\nfact that the shape of the Fermi edge can be severely perturbed when the state\nin question is crossing the Fermi energy. Here, we introduce a method that\ncircumvents these difficulties and accurately extracts both the temperature and\nthe position of the Fermi level for a hot carrier distribution by tracking the\noccupation statistics of the carriers measured in a TR-ARPES experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 11:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

At the interface, the disk thermodynamics and the turbulent\ndynamics are entwined because of the importance of turbulent dissipation and\nthermal ionization. Numerical models of the boundary, however, have neglected\nthe thermodynamics, and thus miss a part of the physics. The aim of this paper\nis to numerically investigate the interplay between thermodynamics and dynamics\nin the inner regions of protoplanetary disks by properly accounting for\nturbulent heating and the dependence of the resistivity on the local\ntemperature. Using the Godunov code RAMSES, we performed a series of 3D global\nnumerical simulations of protoplanetary disks in the cylindrical limit,\nincluding turbulent heating and a simple prescription for radiative cooling. We\nfind that waves excited by the turbulence significantly heat the dead zone, and\nwe subsequently provide a simple theoretical framework for estimating the wave\nheating and consequent temperature profile. In addition, our simulations reveal\nthat the dead-zone inner edge can propagate outward into the dead zone, before\nstaling at a critical radius that can be estimated from a mean-field model. The\nengine driving the propagation is in fact density wave heating close to the\ninterface. A pressure maximum appears at the interface in all simulations, and\nwe note the emergence of the Rossby wave instability in simulations with\nextended azimuth. Our simulations illustrate the complex interplay between\nthermodynamics and turbulent dynamics in the inner regions of protoplanetary\ndisks. They also reveal how important activity at the dead-zone interface can\nbe for the dead-zone thermodynamic structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 13:04:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The\nsimilar behavior of the optical and X-ray light curves suggests that they maybe\nhave a common origin. The long plateau starts from several hundred seconds and\nends at tens of thousands seconds. The peak time of the late rebrightening is\nabout 30000 s. We analyze the energy injection model by means of numerical and\nanalytical solutions, considering both the wind environment and ISM environment\nfor GRB afterglows. We especially study the influence of the injection starting\ntime, ending time, stellar wind density (or density of the circumburst\nenvironment), and injection luminosity on the shape of the afterglow light\ncurves, respectively. We find that the light curve is largely affected by the\nparameters in the wind model. There is a \"bump\" at the late time only in the\nwind model too. In the wind case, it is interesting that the longer the energy\ninjected, the more obvious the rebrightening will be. We also find the peak\ntime of bump is determined by the stellar wind density. We use the late\ncontinuous injection model to interpret the unusual afterglow of GRB 120326A.\nThe model can well fit the observational data, however, we find that the time\nscale of the injection must be larger than ten thousands seconds. This implies\nthat the time scale of the central engine activity must be more than ten\nthousands seconds. This can give useful constraints on the central engine of\nGRBs. We consider a new born millisecond pulsar with strong magnetic field as\nthe central engine. On the other hand, our results suggest that the circumburst\nenvironment of GRB 120326A is very likely a stellar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 14:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We perform a variety of tests which show that the\nLG motion cannot be recovered to better than $150-200 km s^{-1}$ in amplitude\nand within a $\\approx10^\\circ$ in direction. The tests rely on catalogs of mock\ngalaxies identified in the Millennium simulation using semi-analytic galaxy\nformation models.

In our analysis we use a new,\nconcise relation for deriving the LG motion and bulk flow from the true\ndistribution of galaxies in redshift space.

It is applied to main-sequence late-type stars whose optical flux\nmodulation is dominated by starspots. An autocorrelation of the time series was\nused to select stars that allow an accurate determination of starspot rotation\nperiods. A simple two-spot model was applied together with a Bayesian\ninformation criterion to preliminarily select intervals of the time series\nshowing evidence of differential rotation with starspots of almost constant\narea. Finally, the significance of the differential rotation detection and a\nmeasurement of its amplitude and uncertainty were obtained by an a posteriori\nBayesian analysis based on a Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach. We applied our\nmethod to the Sun and eight other stars for which previous spot modelling had\nbeen performed to compare our results with previous ones. We find that\nautocorrelation is a simple method for selecting stars with a coherent\nrotational signal that is a prerequisite for successfully measuring\ndifferential rotation through spot modelling. For a proper Monte Carlo Markov\nChain analysis, it is necessary to take the strong correlations among different\nparameters that exist in spot modelling into account. For the planet-hosting\nstar Kepler-30, we derive a lower limit to the relative amplitude of the\ndifferential rotation of \\Delta P / P = 0.0523 \\pm 0.0016.
