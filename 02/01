In\nthis paper, we present a quantum teleportation procedure that capable to\nteleport either accelerated or non-accelerated information through different\nquantum channels. These quantum chan- nels are based on accelerated multi-qubit\nstates, where each qubit of each of these channels represent a partner. Namely,\nthese states are the the W state, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and\nthe GHZ-like state. Here, we show that the fidelity of teleporting acceler-\nated information is higher than the fidelity of teleporting non-accelerated\ninformation, both through a quantum channel that is based on accelerated state.\nAlso, the comparison among the performance of these three channels shows that\nthe degree of fidelity depends on type of the used channel, type of the\nmeasurement, and value of the acceleration. The result of comparison concludes\nthat teleporting information through channel that is based on the GHZ state is\nmore robust than teleporting information through channels that are based on the\nother two states. For future work, the proposed procedure can be generalized\nlater to achieve communication through a wider quantum network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 19:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-30"}

Only in\nrecent years have new methods become available that allow the generation of\nlikelihoods directly from stochastic simulations. Previous applications of\nthese approximate Bayesian methods have concentrated on relatively simple\nmodels.

Such response is quantified by\nthe distance between the unperturbed and perturbed states, minimized with\nrespect to suitably identified sets of local unitary operations. In order to be\na bona fide measure of quantum correlations, the distance function must be\nchosen among those that are contractive under completely positive and trace\npreserving maps. The most relevant instances of such physically well behaved\nmetrics include the trace, the Bures, and the Hellinger distance.

We\nconsider the case of short polymers, with a polymer length, N, in the range\nN=21-61. The rate of translocation is controlled by a tunable friction\ncoefficient, gamma_{0p}, for monomers inside the nanopore. In the case of\nunforced translocation, the mean translocation time scales with polymer length\nN as <tau_1>~ (N-N_p)^alpha, where N_p is the average number of monomers in the\nnanopore. The exponent approaches the value alpha=2 when the pore friction is\nsufficiently high, in accord with the prediction for the case of the\nquasi-static regime where pore friction dominates. In the case of forced\ntranslocation, the polymer chain is stretched and compressed on the cis and\ntrans sides, respectively, for low gamma_{0p}. However, the chain approaches\nconformational quasi-equilibrium for sufficiently large gamma_{0p}. In this\nlimit the observed scaling of <tau_1> with driving force and chain length\nsupports the FP prediction that <tau> is proportional to N/f_d for sufficiently\nstrong driving force. Monte Carlo simulations are used to calculate\ntranslocation free energy functions for the system. The free energies are used\nwith the Fokker-Planck equation to calculate translocation time distributions.\nAt sufficiently high gamma_{0p}, the predicted distributions are in excellent\nagreement with those calculated from the BD simulations. Thus, the FP equation\nprovides a valid description of translocation dynamics for sufficiently high\npore friction for the range of polymer lengths considered here. Increasing N\nwill require a corresponding increase in pore friction to maintain the validity\nof the FP approach. Outside the regime of low N and high pore friction, the\npolymer is out of equilibrium, and the FP approach is not valid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 18:41:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 19:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

This has led to the development of\na multitude of search techniques and real-time pipeline prototypes. In this\nwork we investigated the applicability of GPUs. We have designed and\nimplemented a scalable, flexibile, GPU-based, transient search pipeline\ncomposed of several processing stages, including RFI mitigation, dedispersion,\nevent detection and classification, as well as data quantisation and\npersistence. These stages are encapsulated as a standalone framework. The\noptimised GPU implementation of direct dedispersion achieves a speedup of more\nthan an order of magnitude when compared to an optimised CPU implementation. We\nuse a density-based clustering algorithm, coupled with a candidate selection\nmechanism to group detections caused by the same event together and\nautomatically classify them as either RFI or of celestial origin. This setup\nwas deployed at the Medicina BEST-II array where several test observations were\nconducted. Finally, we calculate the number of GPUs required to process all the\nbeams for the SKA1-mid non-imaging pipeline. We have also investigated the\napplicability of GPUs for beamforming, where our implementation achieves more\nthan 50% of the peak theoretical performance. We also demonstrate that for\nlarge arrays, and in observations where the generated beams need to be\nprocessed outside of the GPU, the system will become PCIe bandwidth limited.\nThis can be alleviated by processing the synthesised beams on the GPU itself,\nand we demonstrate this by integrating the beamformer to the transient\ndetection pipeline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 18:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-03"}

The resulting network thus consists of a\npoint-to-point channel interfering with a multiple access channel (MAC) and is\ndenoted PIMAC. The sum-capacity of the PIMAC is studied with main focus on the\noptimality of TIN. It turns out that TIN in its naive variant, where all\ntransmitters are active and both receivers use TIN for decoding, is not the\nbest choice for the PIMAC. In fact, a scheme that combines both time division\nmultiple access and TIN (TDMA-TIN) strictly outperforms the naive-TIN scheme.\nFurthermore, it is shown that in some regimes, TDMA-TIN achieves the\nsum-capacity for the deterministic PIMAC and the sum-capacity within a constant\ngap for the Gaussian PIMAC.

For example,\n\"buy\" entails \"own\". Two general strategies for RLE have been proposed: One\nstrategy is to manually construct an asymmetric similarity measure for context\nvectors (directional similarity) and another is to treat RLE as a problem of\nlearning to recognize semantic relations using supervised machine learning\ntechniques (relation classification). In this paper, we experiment with two\nrecent state-of-the-art representatives of the two general strategies. The\nfirst approach is an asymmetric similarity measure (an instance of the\ndirectional similarity strategy), designed to capture the degree to which the\ncontexts of a word, a, form a subset of the contexts of another word, b. The\nsecond approach (an instance of the relation classification strategy)\nrepresents a word pair, a:b, with a feature vector that is the concatenation of\nthe context vectors of a and b, and then applies supervised learning to a\ntraining set of labeled feature vectors. Additionally, we introduce a third\napproach that is a new instance of the relation classification strategy. The\nthird approach represents a word pair, a:b, with a feature vector in which the\nfeatures are the differences in the similarities of a and b to a set of\nreference words. All three approaches use vector space models (VSMs) of\nsemantics, based on word-context matrices. We perform an extensive evaluation\nof the three approaches using three different datasets. The proposed new\napproach (similarity differences) performs significantly better than the other\ntwo approaches on some datasets and there is no dataset for which it is\nsignificantly worse. Our results suggest it is beneficial to make connections\nbetween the research in lexical entailment and the research in semantic\nrelation classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 19:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-02"}

This an important statistical inverse\nproblem arising in the analysis of data at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.\nMathematically, the problem is formalized as one of estimating the intensity\nfunction of an indirectly observed Poisson point process. Particle physicists\nare particularly keen on unfolding methods that feature a principled way of\nchoosing the regularization strength and allow for the quantification of the\nuncertainty inherent in the solution. Though there are many approaches that\nhave been considered by experimental physicists, it can be argued that few --\nif any -- of these deal with these two key issues in a satisfactory manner.

Even though the instantaneous SFR\ndecreases rapidly after the starburst, the stars that were formed in the\nstarburst remain dust-obscured and thus produce significant IR luminosity.\nConsequently, use of the IR luminosity as an SFR indicator may cause one to\nconclude that post-starburst galaxies are still star-forming, whereas in\nreality, star formation was recently quenched.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 21:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Sep 2014 19:16:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 22:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

As $T$ further decreases, after reaching the maximum, the\ndephasing rate drops more quickly than in normal metals, behaving as\n$(T/T_K)^3$ instead of $(T/T_K)^2$. Furthermore, the resistivity has a distinct\npeak above the saturation value near $T_K$.

Evolutionary\nchanges to such functional DNA are hypothesized to be major contributors to\nphenotypic diversity within and between species; but despite the importance of\nTF motifs for gene expression, no method exists to test for motif loss or gain.\nAssuming that motif counts are Binomially distributed, and allowing for\ndependencies between motif instances in evolutionarily related sequences, we\nderive the probability mass function of the difference in motif counts between\ntwo nucleotide sequences. We provide a method to numerically estimate this\ndistribution from genomic data and show through simulations that our estimator\nis accurate. Finally, we introduce the R package {\\tt motifDiverge} that\nimplements our methodology and illustrate its application to gene regulatory\nenhancers identified by a mouse developmental time course experiment. While\nthis study was motivated by analysis of regulatory motifs, our results can be\napplied to any problem involving two correlated Bernoulli trials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2014 02:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-04"}

We\nexplore whether the impulsive changes in the orbital elements of planets,\ncaused by an hyperbolic stellar flyby, can be fully damped by the circumstellar\ndisk surrounding the star. The time required to disperse stellar clusters is in\nfact comparable to circumstellar disk's lifetime. We have modelled in 3D a\nsystem made of a solar type star surrounded by a low density disk with a giant\nplanet embedded in it approached on a hyperbolic encounter trajectory by a\nsecond star, of similar mass and with its own disk. We focus on extreme\nconfigurations where a very deep stellar flyby perturbs a Jovian planet on an\nexternal orbit. This allows to test in full the ability of the disk to erase\nthe effects of the stellar encounter. We find that the amount of mass lost by\nthe disk during the stellar flyby is less than in 2D models where a single disk\nwas considered due to the mass exchange between the two disks at the encounter.\nThe damping in eccentricity is slightly faster than in 2D models and it occurs\non timescales of the order of a few kyr. The only trace of the flyby left in\nthe planet system, after about 10^4 yr, is a small misalignment, lower than 9\ndegrees, between the star equatorial plane and the planet orbit. In a realistic\nmodel based on 3D simulations of star--planet--disk interactions, we find that\nstellar flybys cannot excite significant eccentricities and inclinations of\nplanets in stellar clusters.

We first indicate that the synchronisation frequency of the\noscillators is independent of the natural frequency distribution for a\ncompletely connected network. Further we analyse the case of oscillators in a\ndirected ring-network where asymmetry in the natural frequency distribution is\nseen to shift the synchronisation frequency of the network. We also present an\nestimate of the shift in the frequencies for slightly asymmetric distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2014 10:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-22"}

It is well-known that imposing an $\\ell_0$ constraint\nleads to an NP-hard minimization problem. The convex relaxation approach has\nreceived considerable attention, where the $\\ell_0$-norm is replaced by the\n$\\ell_1$-norm. Among the many efficient $\\ell_1$ solvers, the homotopy\nalgorithm minimizes $\\|y-Ax\\|_2^2+\\lambda\\|x\\|_1$ with respect to x for a\ncontinuum of $\\lambda$'s. It is inspired by the piecewise regularity of the\n$\\ell_1$-regularization path, also referred to as the homotopy path. In this\npaper, we address the minimization problem $\\|y-Ax\\|_2^2+\\lambda\\|x\\|_0$ for a\ncontinuum of $\\lambda$'s and propose two heuristic search algorithms for\n$\\ell_0$-homotopy. Continuation Single Best Replacement is a forward-backward\ngreedy strategy extending the Single Best Replacement algorithm, previously\nproposed for $\\ell_0$-minimization at a given $\\lambda$. The adaptive search of\nthe $\\lambda$-values is inspired by $\\ell_1$-homotopy. $\\ell_0$ Regularization\nPath Descent is a more complex algorithm exploiting the structural properties\nof the $\\ell_0$-regularization path, which is piecewise constant with respect\nto $\\lambda$. Both algorithms are empirically evaluated for difficult inverse\nproblems involving ill-conditioned dictionaries. Finally, we show that they can\nbe easily coupled with usual methods of model order selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2014 22:26:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 16:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-29"}
