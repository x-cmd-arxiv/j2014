A WENO reconstruction technique\nis used to achieve high order of accuracy in space, while an element-local\nspace-time Discontinuous Galerkin finite element predictor on moving meshes is\nused to obtain a high order accurate one-step time discretization. Within the\nspace-time predictor the physical element is mapped onto a reference element\nusing an isoparametric approach, where the space-time basis and test functions\nare given by the Lagrange interpolation polynomials passing through a\npredefined set of space-time nodes. Since our algorithm is cell-centered, the\nfinal mesh motion is computed by using a suitable node solver algorithm. A\nrezoning step as well as a flattener strategy are used in some of the test\nproblems to avoid mesh tangling or excessive element deformations that may\noccur when the computation involves strong shocks or shear waves. We apply our\nnew high order unstructured ALE schemes to the 3D Euler equations of\ncompressible gas dynamics, for which a set of classical numerical test problems\nhas been solved and for which convergence rates up to sixth order of accuracy\nin space and time have been obtained. We furthermore consider the equations of\nclassical ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) as well as the non-conservative\nseven-equation Baer-Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flows with stiff\nrelaxation source terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2014 16:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

For example, in the general theory of relativity the geometry is a\ndynamical structure that guides the motion of matter, and, in turn, it is bent\nand curved by the presence of matter. Other than this, the classical vacuum is\na structure void of any physical properties, since classically properties are\nstrictly associated with physical objects such as particles and\nfinite-amplitude fields. The situation is very different in quantum physics. As\nI will show in this paper, the difference stems from the fact that in quantum\nphysics the properties are not strictly tied to objects. We know for example\nthat physical properties come into existence - as values of observables - only\nwhen the object is measured. Thus, quantum physics allows us to detach\nproperties from objects. This has consequences: one does not need pre-existing\nreal objects to create actual properties, and indeed under certain\nperturbations the quantum vacuum produces observable effects such as energy\nshifts and creation of particles. An open question is if by necessity the\nvacuum comes with an embedded geometry, and if it is possible to construct\nviable physical theories in which geometry is detached from the vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2014 16:55:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 13:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-15"}

For the closely related system\nNa$_2$Cu$_2$TeO$_6$, DFT yields substantially enhanced $J_{1b}$, but weaker\n$J_{1a}$. The comparative analysis renders the buckling of the chains as the\nkey parameter altering the magnetic coupling regime. Numerical simulation of\nthe dispersion relations of the alternating chain model clarify why both\nantiferromagnetic and ferrromagnetic $J_{1a}$ can reproduce the experimental\nmagnetic susceptibility data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2014 17:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 09:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-13"}

However, widespread applications of\nmagnetic memory and logic devices will require the development of efficient\nmechanisms for reorienting their magnetization using the least possible current\nand power.

Disturbed spirals\nexhibit enhanced specific star formation rates (SSFRs), the enhancement\nincreasing in galaxies of 'later' morphological type (which have more gas and\nsmaller bulges). By combining the SSFR enhancements with the fraction of time\nspirals spend in this 'enhanced' mode, we estimate that ~40% of the star\nformation in local spirals is directly triggered by minor mergers. The\ndisturbed spirals also exhibit higher nuclear-accretion rates, implying that\nminor mergers enhance the growth rate of the central black hole.

We are now\nmoving into an era where we can begin to address fundamental questions\nconcerning the diversity of exoplanetary compositions, atmospheric and interior\nprocesses, and formation histories, just as have been pursued for solar system\nplanets over the past century. Exoplanetary atmospheres provide a direct means\nto address these questions via their observable spectral signatures. In the\nlast decade, and particularly in the last five years, tremendous progress has\nbeen made in detecting atmospheric signatures of exoplanets through photometric\nand spectroscopic methods using a variety of space-borne and/or ground-based\nobservational facilities. These observations are beginning to provide important\nconstraints on a wide gamut of atmospheric properties, including\npressure-temperature profiles, chemical compositions, energy circulation,\npresence of clouds, and non-equilibrium processes. The latest studies are also\nbeginning to connect the inferred chemical compositions to exoplanetary\nformation conditions. In the present chapter, we review the most recent\ndevelopments in the area of exoplanetary atmospheres. Our review covers\nadvances in both observations and theory of exoplanetary atmospheres, and spans\na broad range of exoplanet types (gas giants, ice giants, and super-Earths) and\ndetection methods (transiting planets, direct imaging, and radial velocity). We\nclose with a discussion of the bright prospects for future studies of\nexoplanetary atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2014 21:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The fraction of quenched\nsatellites is independent of halo mass and the surrounding large-scale\noverdensity, but increases towards the centres of the haloes, as previously\nfound. The morphological mix is, however, constant with radial position,\nindicating that the well-known morphology-density relation results from the\nincreasing fraction of quenched galaxies towards the centres of haloes. The\nconstancy of the morphological outcome suggests that mass-quenching and\nsatellite quenching have the same effect on the morphologies of the galaxies.\nThe quenched satellites have larger B/T and smaller half-light radii than the\nstar-forming satellites. These are mostly due to differences in the disks. The\nbulges in quenched satellites have very similar luminosities and surface\nbrightness profiles, and any mass growth of the bulges associated with\nquenching cannot greatly change these quantities. The quenched disks are\nfainter and have smaller scale lengths than in star-forming satellites. This\ncan be explained either by a differential fading of the disks or if disks were\ngenerally smaller in the past, both of which are expected in an inside-out\ngrowth of disks. At least at low redshifts, the structure of massive quenched\nsatellites is produced by processes that operate before quenching takes place.\nA comparison with semi-analytic models argues for a reduction in the efficiency\nof group halos in quenching their disk satellites and for mechanisms to\nincrease the B/T of low mass quenched satellites.

Intrinsically,\nthe boundedly rational dynamic user equilibrium (BR-DUE) model we present\nassumes that travelers do not always seek the least costly\nroute-and-departure-time choice. Rather, their perception of travel cost is\naffected by an indifference band describing travelers' tolerance of the\ndifference between their experienced travel costs and the minimum travel cost.\nAn extension of the BR-DUE problem is the so-called variable tolerance dynamic\nuser equilibrium (VT-BR-DUE) wherein endogenously determined tolerances may\ndepend not only on paths, but also on the established path departure rates.\nThis paper presents a unified approach for modeling both BR-DUE and VT-BR-DUE,\nwhich makes significant contributions to model formulation, analysis of\nexistence, solution characterization, and heuristic numerical computation of\nsuch problems. The VT-BR-DUE problem, together with the BR-DUE problem as a\nspecial case, is formulated as a variational inequality.

Large\ndistances demand large transmitted power and/or large antennas, while the\npropagation is transparent over a wide bandwidth. Recognizing a fundamental\ntradeoff, reduced energy delivered to the receiver at the expense of wide\nbandwidth (the opposite of terrestrial objectives) is advantageous. Wide\nbandwidth also results in simpler design and implementation, allowing\ncircumvention of dispersion and scattering arising in the interstellar medium\nand motion effects and obviating any related processing. The minimum energy\ndelivered to the receiver per bit of information is determined by cosmic\nmicrowave background alone. By mapping a single bit onto a carrier burst, the\nMorse code invented for the telegraph in 1836 comes closer to this minimum\nenergy than approaches used in modern terrestrial radio. Rather than the\nterrestrial approach of adding phases and amplitudes to increases information\ncapacity while minimizing bandwidth, adding multiple time-frequency locations\nfor carrier bursts increases capacity while minimizing energy per information\nbit. The resulting location code is extremely simple and yet can approach the\nminimum energy as bandwidth is expanded. It is consistent with easy discovery,\nsince carrier bursts are energetic and straightforward modifications to\npost-detection pattern recognition can identify burst patterns. The\ninterstellar coherence hole captures the time and frequency coherence\nconstraints, and observations of the environment by transmitter and receiver\nconstrain the burst parameters and limit the search scope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2014 00:10:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Mar 2014 19:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

High-current-density Nb-AlN-Nb\nsuperconducting-insulating-superconducting (SIS) tunnel junctions are used as\nthe mixing element. The measured double-sideband (DSB) 230 GHz receiver noise\ntemperature, uncorrected for optics loss, ranges from 50K at 185 GHz, 33K at\n246 GHz, to 51K at 280 GHz. In this frequency range the mixer has a DSB\nconversion gain of 0 +- 1.5 dB. The measured 460 GHz double-sideband receiver\nnoise temperature, uncorrected for optics loss, is 32K at 400 GHz, 34K at 460\nGHz, and 61K at 520 GHz. Similar to the 230 GHz balanced mixer, the DSB mixer\nconversion gain is 1 +- 1 dB. To help optimize performance, the mixer IF\ncircuits and bias injection are entirely planar by design. Dual-frequency\nobservation, by means of separating the incoming circular polarized electric\nfield into two orthogonal components, is another important mode of operation\noffered by the new facility instrumentation. Instrumental stability is\nexcellent supporting the LO noise cancellation properties of the balanced mixer\nconfiguration. In the spring of 2012 the dual-frequency 230/460 SIS receiver\nwas successfully installed at Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO), Mauna\nKea, HI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2014 01:16:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

A wide variety of\nschemes for both corrections have been proposed for decades. Regarding the\nimage-charge correction, Freysoldt, Neugebauer, and Van de Walle (FNV) recently\nproposed a novel method that enables us to accurately estimate the correction\nenergy a posteriori through alignment of the defect-induced potential to the\nmodel charge potential [Freysoldt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 016402 (2009)].\nThis method, however, still has two issues in practice. Firstly, it uses\nplanar-averaged potential for determining the potential offset, which cannot be\nreadily applied to relaxed system. Secondly, the long-range Coulomb interaction\nis assumed to be screened by a macroscopic dielectric constant. This is valid\nonly for cubic systems and can bring forth huge errors for defects in\nanisotropic materials. In this study, we use the atomic site electrostatic\npotential as a potential marker instead of the planar-averaged potential, and\nextend the FNV scheme by adopting the point charge model in an anisotropic\nmedium for estimating long-range interactions. We also revisit the conventional\npotential alignment correction and show that it is fully included in the\nimage-charge correction and therefore unnecessary. In addition, we show that\nthe potential alignment corresponds to a part of first-order and full of\nthird-order image-charge correction; thus the third-order image-charge\ncontribution is absent after the potential alignment. Finally, a systematic\nassessment of the accuracy of the extended FNV correction scheme is performed\nfor a wide range of material classes. The defect formation energies calculated\nusing around 100-atom supercells are successfully corrected even after atomic\nrelaxation within a few tenths of eV compared to those in the dilute limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2014 01:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-28"}

A major numerical bottleneck precipitating this\nunder-performance, especially for higher dimensional systems, is the\nprogressive particle impoverishment owing to weight collapse and the aim of the\ncurrent work is to address this problem by replacing weight-based updates\nthrough additive ones.

We do this in the context of a generalized GARCH model with\nmultiple time scales and asymmetry. It is argued that the reason for the\nobserved volatility risk premium is tail risk aversion. We parametrize such\nrisk aversion in terms of three coefficients: convexity, skew and kurtosis risk\npremium. We propose that option prices under the real-world measure are not\nmartingales, but that their drift is governed by such tail risk premia. We then\nderive a fair-pricing equation for options and show that the solutions can be\nwritten in terms of a stochastic volatility model in continuous time and under\na martingale probability measure. This gives a precise connection between the\npricing and real-world probability measures, which cannot be obtained using\nGirsanov Theorem. We find that the convexity risk premium, not only shifts the\noverall implied volatility level, but also changes its term structure.\nMoreover, the skew risk premium makes the skewness of the volatility smile\nsteeper than a pure historical estimate.

It is\nshown that with an appropriate choice of transformation functions, this method\nmanages to preserve the good properties of original SMs; more precisely, superb\ncomputational efficiency when high level of accuracy is necessary. This is made\npossible by analytically exploiting the properties of the transformation\nfunction and the Fourier sine series. An especially important property of this\napproach is the possibility of calculating the Hartree energy very efficiently.\nThis is done by exploiting the positive properties of the sine series as a\nbasis set and conducting an extinctive part of the calculations analytically.\nWe illustrate the efficiency of this method and implement it to solve the\nPoisson's and Helmholtz equations in both one and three dimensions. The\nefficiency of the method is verified through a comparison to recently published\nresults for both one and three dimensional problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2014 06:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-07"}

Of particular interest is the setting where the\nnumber of clusters/submatrices is allowed to grow unbounded with the problem\nsize.

These were erected almost until the end\nof the Bronze Age (Burl 2000, 1993). Significantly, a series of astronomical\npatternings have been empirically verified for many Bronze Age monuments that\nwere erected between 1400-900 BC (Higginbottom et 14 al. 2013, 2003, 2001,\n2000).

Comets are given initial orbits with perihelion distances\nbetween 5 and 36 AU, and evolve under planetary, stellar and Galactic\nperturbations for 4.5 Gyr. This process leads to the formation of an Oort cloud\n(which we define as the region of semimajor axes a>1000 AU), and to a flux of\ncometary bodies from the Oort cloud returning to the planetary region at the\npresent epoch. The results are consistent with the dynamical characteristics of\nshort-period comets and other observed cometary populations: the near-parabolic\nflux, Centaurs, and high-eccentricity trans-Neptunian objects. To achieve this\nconsistency with observations, the model requires that the number of comets\nversus initial perihelion distance is concentrated towards the outer planetary\nregion. Moreover, the mean physical lifetime of observable comets in the inner\nplanetary region (q<2.5 AU) at the present epoch should be an increasing\nfunction of the comets' initial perihelion distances. Virtually all observed\nHalley-type comets and nearly half of observed Jupiter-family comets come from\nthe Oort cloud, and initially (4.5 Gyr ago) from orbits concentrated near the\nouter planetary region.

The cross-correlation is measured by stacking quasar absorption\nspectra shifted to the redshift of galaxies that are within a certain impact\nparameter bin of the quasar, after dividing by a quasar continuum model.

Although\ndust grains are thought to grow from the submicron sizes typical of\ninterstellar dust to micron size particles in the dense regions of molecular\nclouds and cores, the growth from micron size particles to pebbles and\nkilometre size bodies must occur in protoplanetary disks. This step in the\nformation of planetary systems is the last stage of solids evolution that can\nbe observed directly in young extrasolar systems.\n  In this chapter we review the constraints on the physics of grain-grain\ncollisions as they have emerged from laboratory experiments and numerical\ncomputations. We then review the current theoretical understanding of the\nglobal processes governing the evolution of solids in protoplanetary disks,\nincluding dust settling, growth, and radial transport. The predicted\nobservational signatures are summarized.\n  We discuss recent developments in the study of grain growth in molecular\ncloud cores and in collapsing envelopes of protostars as these provide the\ninitial conditions for the dust in disks. We discuss the observational evidence\nfor the growth of grains in young disks from mm surveys, as well as the recent\nevidence of radial variations of the dust properties in disks. We include a\nbrief discussion of the constraints on the small end of the grain size\ndistribution and on dust settling as derived from optical and IR observations.\nThe observations are discussed in the context of global dust evolution models,\nin particular we focus on the emerging evidence for a very efficient early\ngrowth of grains and the radial distribution of grain sizes in disks.

On-line secret sharing is a\nuseful primitive when the set of participants grows in time, and redistributing\nthe secret is too expensive. In this paper we start the investigation of\nunconditionally secure on-line secret sharing schemes. The complexity of a\nsecret sharing scheme is the size of the largest share a single participant can\nreceive over the size of the secret. The infimum of this amount in the on-line\nor off-line setting is the on-line or off-line complexity of the access\nstructure, respectively. For paths on at most five vertices and cycles on at\nmost six vertices the on-line and offline complexities are equal, while for\nother paths and cycles these values differ. We show that the gap between these\nvalues can be arbitrarily large even for graph based access structures. We\npresent a general on-line secret sharing scheme that we call first-fit. Its\ncomplexity is the maximal degree of the access structure. We show, however,\nthat this on-line scheme is never optimal: the on-line complexity is always\nstrictly less than the maximal degree. On the other hand, we give examples\nwhere the first-fit scheme is almost optimal, namely, the on-line complexity\ncan be arbitrarily close to the maximal degree. The performance ratio is the\nratio of the on-line and off-line complexities of the same access structure.

Considering one\nwhole slide as a collection (a bag) of feature vectors, however, poses the\nproblem of how to handle this bag. A simple, and surprisingly effective,\napproach is to summarize the bag of feature vectors by a few quantile values\nper feature. This characterizes the full distribution of all instances, thereby\nassuming that all instances in a bag are informative. This representation is\nparticularly useful when each bag contains many feature vectors, which is the\ncase in the classification of the immunofluorescence images.

Earlier observations with (and simulations of)\nthe Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) suggested that these were due\nto calibration with incomplete sky models. A theoretical framework is derived\nthat validates this suggestion, and provides predictions of ghost formation in\na two-source scenario. The predictions are found to accurately match the result\nof simulations, and qualitatively reproduce the ghosts previously seen in\nobservational data. The theory also provides explanations for many previously\npuzzling features of these artefacts (regular geometry, PSF-like sidelobes,\nseeming independence on model flux), and shows that the observed phenomenon of\nflux suppression affecting unmodelled sources is due to the same mechanism. We\ndemonstrate that this ghost formation mechanism is a fundamental feature of\ncalibration, and exhibits a particularly strong and localized signature due to\narray redundancy. To some extent this mechanism will affect all observations\n(including those with non-redundant arrays), though in most cases the ghosts\nremain hidden below the noise or masked by other instrumental artefacts.

Database access can be simultaneously priced under two\ndifferent schemes: the registration scheme and the service plan scheme. In the\nregistration scheme, the database reserves part of the TV bandwidth for\nregistered White Space Devices (WSDs). In the service plan scheme, the WSDs are\ncharged according to their queries. In this paper, we investigate the business\nmodel for the TVWS database under a hybrid pricing scheme. We consider the\nscenario where a database operator employs both the registration scheme and the\nservice plan scheme to serve the SUs. The SUs' choices of different pricing\nschemes are modeled as a non-cooperative game and we derive distributed\nalgorithms to achieve Nash Equilibrium (NE). Considering the NE of the SUs, the\ndatabase operator optimally determines pricing parameters for both pricing\nschemes in terms of bandwidth reservation, registration fee and query plans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2014 05:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-10"}

A comprehensive search for\nSOHO/EIT waves was carried out for 179 SEP events during Solar Cycle 23\n(1997-2006). 87% of the SEP events were found to be accompanied by EIT waves.\nIn order to test if the EIT waves play a role in the SEP acceleration, we\ncompared their extrapolated arrival time at the footpoint of the Parker spiral\nwith the particle onset in the 26 eastern SEP events that had no direct\nmagnetic connection to the Earth.

We classify the retreat of the north polar seasonal cap into\n'pre-sublimation', 'early spring', 'asymmetric' and 'stable' periods according\nto the prevalent H2O ice grain size distributions. 2. During the early spring,\nthe signatures of CO2 ice at the edge of the cap are obscured by H2O ice, which\nincreases the apparent size of the H2O ice annulus around the seasonal CO2 cap\nat this time. At around Ls=25{\\deg}, this process changes into an asymmetrical\ndistribution of H2O deposition, covering CO2 signatures more rapidly in the\nlongitude range from 90-210{\\deg}E. 3. We detect signatures of 'pure' CO2 ice\nin extremely limited locations (in Lomonosov Crater) even in mid winter. H2O\nice signatures appear everywhere in the retreating CO2 seasonal cap, in\ncontrast with the south polar seasonal cap. 4. We find that average H2O ice\ngrain sizes continuously increase from northern mid-winter to the end of\nspringtime - this is the inverse of the behavior of CO2 ice grain sizes in the\nsouthern springtime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2014 06:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}
