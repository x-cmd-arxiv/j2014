In both cases, the\nturbulence dissipation rate can be estimated using single vertical profiles\nfrom shipborne instrumentation.

The variance of the temperature time series just\nabove the internal wave frequency band is well correlated with the Thorpe\nscale. The method is based on the time--frequency decomposition of variance\ncalled \"maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform\".

Such features are generally described in terms of multi-dimensional\nquadratic expansions and corresponding definitions of effective masses.\nMulti-dimensional expansions, however, are permissible only under strict\nconditions that are typically violated by degenerate bands and even some\nnon-degenerate bands. Suggestive terms such as \"band warping\" or \"corrugated\nenergy surfaces\" have been used to refer to such situations and ad hoc methods\nhave been developed to treat them. While numerical calculations may reflect\nsuch features, a complete theory of band warping has not been developed. We\ndevelop a generally applicable theory, based on radial expansions, and a\ncorresponding definition of angular effective mass. Our theory also accounts\nfor effects of band non-parabolicity and anisotropy, which hitherto have not\nbeen precisely distinguished from, if not utterly confused with, band warping.\nBased on our theory, we develop precise procedures to evaluate band warping\nquantitatively.

From that theory we\ndiscover the formal existence at critical points of transport-equivalent\nellipsoidal bands that yield identical results from the standpoint of any\ntransport property.

One of its shortcomings is that it requires\nauxiliary optimization of an acquisition function at each iteration. This\nauxiliary optimization can be costly and very hard to carry out in practice.\nMoreover, it creates serious theoretical concerns, as most of the convergence\nresults assume that the exact optimum of the acquisition function can be found.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new technique for efficient global optimization\nthat combines Gaussian process confidence bounds and treed simultaneous\noptimistic optimization to eliminate the need for auxiliary optimization of\nacquisition functions. The experiments with global optimization benchmarks and\na novel application to automatic information extraction demonstrate that the\nresulting technique is more efficient than the two approaches from which it\ndraws inspiration. Unlike most theoretical analyses of Bayesian optimization\nwith Gaussian processes, our finite-time convergence rate proofs do not require\nexact optimization of an acquisition function.

We assume a STDMA algorithm that takes advantage of the regularity of\ngrid topology to also provide a spatially periodic coloring (\"tiling\" of the\nsame color pattern).

Its footprint spans the Galactic latitude range -5 <\nb < +5 at all longitudes south of the celestial equator. Extensions around the\nGalactic Centre to Galactic latitudes +/-10 bring in much of the Galactic\nBulge. This ESO public survey, begun on 28th December 2011, reaches down to\n20th magnitude (10-sigma) and will provide single-epoch digital optical\nphotometry for around 300 million stars. The observing strategy and data\npipelining is described, and an appraisal of the segmented narrowband Halpha\nfilter in use is presented. Using model atmospheres and library spectra, we\ncompute main-sequence (u - g), (g - r), (r - i) and (r - Halpha) stellar\ncolours in the Vega system. We report on a preliminary validation of the\nphotometry using test data obtained from two pointings overlapping the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey. An example of the (u - g, g - r) and (r - Halpha, r - i)\ndiagrams for a full VPHAS+ survey field is given. Attention is drawn to the\nopportunities for studies of compact nebulae and nebular morphologies that\narise from the image quality being achieved. The value of the u band as the\nmeans to identify planetary-nebula central stars is demonstrated by the\ndiscovery of the central star of NGC 2899 in survey data. Thanks to its\nexcellent imaging performance, the VST/OmegaCam combination used by this survey\nis a perfect vehicle for automated searches for reddened early-type stars, and\nwill allow the discovery and analysis of compact binaries, white dwarfs and\ntransient sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2014 19:11:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Mar 2014 08:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Because these systems may be difficult to\nexplain in the paradigm of core accretion and disk migration, it has been\nsuggested that they formed in situ within protoplanetary disks with high solid\nsurface densities. The strong connection between giant planet occurrence and\nstellar metallicity is thought to be linked to enhanced solid surface densities\nin disks around metal-rich stars, so the presence of a giant planet can be a\ndetectable sign of planet formation in a high solid surface density disk. I\nformulate quantitative predictions for the frequency of long-period giant\nplanets in these in situ models of planet formation by translating the proposed\nincrease in disk mass into an equivalent metallicity enhancement. I rederive\nthe scaling of giant planet occurrence with metallicity as P_gp =\n0.05_{-0.02}^{+0.02} x 10^{(2.1 +/- 0.4) [M/H]} = 0.08_{-0.03}^{+0.02} x\n10^{(2.3 +/- 0.4) [Fe/H]} and show that there is significant tension between\nthe frequency of giant planets suggested by the minimum mass extrasolar nebula\nscenario and the observational upper limits. This fact suggests that high-mass\ndisks alone cannot explain the observed properties of the close-in Kepler\nmultiplanet systems and that migration is still a necessary contributor to\ntheir formation.

Using several zoom simulations of clusters we show that the coherent\ndistribution of the poststarbursts can be reasonably well-reproduced using a\nsimple quenching scenario. Specifically, the phase space is best reproduced if\nsatellite quenching occurs on a rapid timescale (0.1 < tau_{Q} < 0.5 Gyr) after\ngalaxies make their first passage of R ~ 0.5R_{200}, a process that takes a\ntotal time of ~ 1 Gyr after first infall. We compare this quenching timescale\nto the timescale implied by the stellar populations of the poststarburst\ngalaxies and find that the poststarburst spectra are well-fit by a rapid\nquenching (tau_{Q} = 0.4^{+0.3}_{-0.4} Gyr) of a typical star-forming galaxy.\nThe similarity between the quenching timescales derived from these independent\nindicators is a strong consistency check of the quenching model. Given that the\nmodel implies satellite quenching is rapid, and occurs well within R_{200},\nthis would suggest that ram-pressure stripping of either the hot or cold gas\ncomponent of galaxies are the most plausible candidates for the physical\nmechanism.

Experiments have directly probed these\ntopological spin textures, revealed their nontrivial properties, and led to\nsuggestions for novel applications. However, in 3D the skyrmion crystal phase\nis observed only in a narrow region of the temperature-field phase diagram. We\nshow here, using a general analysis based on symmetry, that skyrmions are much\nmore readily stabilized in two-dimensional (2D) systems with Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling. This enhanced stability arises from the competition between field and\neasy-plane magnetic anisotropy and results in a nontrivial structure in the\ntopological charge density in the core of the skyrmions. We further show that,\nin a variety of microscopic models for magnetic exchange, the required\neasy-plane anisotropy naturally arises from the same spin-orbit coupling that\nis responsible for the chiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Our results\nare of particular interest for 2D materials like thin films, surfaces, and\noxide interfaces, where broken surface-inversion symmetry and Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling naturally lead to chiral exchange and easy-plane compass anisotropy.\nOur theory gives a clear direction for experimental studies of 2D magnetic\nmaterials to stabilize skyrmions over a large range of magnetic fields down to\nT=0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2014 21:00:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Sep 2014 01:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-11"}

These signatures are expected when the mass\nratio between the holes is not extreme and the system is fed by a circumbinary\ndisk.

Among these the role of the Hall effect is\nthe least explored and most poorly understood. We have included all three\nnon-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of\nthe Hall effect on PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In\nthis first paper, we focus on the inner region of PPDs, where previous studies\nexcluding the Hall effect have revealed that the inner disk up to ~10 AU is\nlargely laminar, with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind. We confirm\nthis basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest\nmodifications to the wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the\nlarge-scale poloidal magnetic field B_0 threading the disk. When B_0.Omega>0,\nthe horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified toward the disk interior,\nleading to a stronger disk wind (by ~50% or less in terms of the wind-driven\naccretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field also leads to much stronger\nlarge-scale Maxwell stress (magnetic braking) that contributes to a\nconsiderable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate. When B_0.Omega<0, the\nhorizontal magnetic field is reduced, leading to a weaker disk wind (by ~20%)\nand negligible magnetic braking. Moreover, we find that when B_0.Omega>0, the\nlaminar region extends farther to ~15 AU before the magneto-rotational\ninstability sets in, while for B_0.Omega<0, the laminar region extends only to\n~3-5 AU for a typical PPD accretion rates. Scaling relations for the wind\nproperties, especially the wind-driven accretion rate, are provided for aligned\nand anti-aligned field geometries. Issues with the symmetry of the wind\nsolutions and grain abundance are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2014 22:51:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jun 2014 17:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Our results suggest that a\nconfinement-like region and a Higgs-like region appear even in two dimensions.\nIn the confinement-like region, the static potential rises linearly, with\nstring breaking at large distances, while in the Higgs-like region, it is of\nYukawa type, consistent with a Higgs-type mechanism. The correlation length\nobtained from the W propagator has a finite maximum between these regions. The\nplaquette expectation value shows a smooth cross-over consistent with the\nFradkin-Shenker-Osterwalder-Seiler theorem.

This source-lens\nclustering (SLC) effect has two sources, intrinsic source clustering and cosmic\nmagnification (magnification/size bias). Lensing tomography can suppress the\nformer. However, this reduction is limited by the existence of photo-z error\nand nonzero redshift bin width. Furthermore, SLC induced by cosmic\nmagnification cannot be reduced by lensing tomography. Through N-body\nsimulations, we quantify the impact of SLC on the lensing power spectrum in the\ncontext of lensing tomography. We consider both the standard estimator and the\npixel-based estimator. We find that none of them can satisfactorily handle both\nsources of SLC. (1) For the standard estimator, SLC induced by both sources can\nbias the lensing power spectrum by O(1)-O(10)%. Intrinsic source clustering\nalso increases statistical uncertainties in the measured lensing power\nspectrum. However, the standard estimator suppresses intrinsic source\nclustering in the cross-spectrum. (2) In contrast, the pixel-based estimator\nsuppresses SLC through cosmic magnification. However, it fails to suppress SLC\nthrough intrinsic source clustering and the measured lensing power spectrum can\nbe biased low by O(1)-O(10)%. In short, for typical photo-z errors\n(sigma_z/(1+z)=0.05) and photo-z bin sizes (Delta_z^P=0.2), SLC alters the\nlensing E-mode power spectrum by 1-10%, with ell~10^3$ and z_s~1 being of\nparticular interest to weak lensing cosmology.

We investigate the different manifestations of AGN feedback in the\nevolved, powerful radio source 3C293 and their impact on the molecular gas of\nits host galaxy, which harbors young star-forming regions and fast outflows of\nHI and ionized gas. Methods. We study the distribution and kinematics of the\nmolecular gas of 3C293 using high spatial resolution observations of the\nCO(1-0) and CO(2-1) lines, and the 3 and 1mm continuum taken with the IRAM\nPdBI. We mapped the molecular gas of 3C293 and compared it with the dust and\nstar-formation images of the host. We searched for signatures of outflow\nmotions in the CO kinematics, and reexamined the evidence of outflowing gas in\nthe HI spectra. We also derived the star formation rate (SFR) and efficiency\n(SFE) of the host with all available SFR tracers from the literature, and\ncompared them with the SFE of young and evolved radio galaxies and normal\nstar-forming galaxies. Results. The CO(1-0) emission line shows that the\nmolecular gas in 3C293 is distributed along a massive (2.2E10 Msun) warped disk\nwith diameter of 21 kpc that rotates around the AGN. Our data show that the\ndust and the star formation are clearly associated with the CO disk. The\nCO(2-1) emission is located in the inner 7 kpc (diameter) region around the\nAGN, coincident with the inner part of the CO(1-0) disk.

The trait distribution within the prey population is the result\nof interplay between genetic inheritance and mutation, as well as selectivity\nin the consumption of prey by the predator. The evolutionary processes are\nconsidered to take place on the same time scale as ecological dynamics, i.e. we\nconsider the evolution to be rapid. Previously published results show that\npopulation structuring and rapid evolution in such predator-prey system can\nstabilise an otherwise globally unstable dynamics even with an unlimited\ncarrying capacity of prey. However, those findings were only based on direct\nnumerical simulation of equations and obtained for particular parametrisations\nof model functions, which obviously calls into question the correctness and\ngenerality of the previous results. The main objective of the current study is\nto treat the model analytically and consider various parametrisations of\npredator selectivity and inheritance kernel. We investigate the existence of a\ncoexistence stationary state in the model and carry out stability analysis of\nthis state. We derive expressions for the Hopf bifurcation curve which can be\nused for constructing bifurcation diagrams in the parameter space without the\nneed for a direct numerical simulation of the underlying integro-differential\nequations. We analytically show the possibility of stabilisation of a globally\nunstable predator-prey system with prey structuring. We prove that the\ncoexistence stationary state is stable when the saturation in the predation\nterm is low. Finally, for a class of kernels describing genetic inheritance and\nmutation we show that stability of the predator-prey interaction will require a\nselectivity of predation according to the life trait.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 11:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-27"}

While the largest glitches have long been taken into\naccount by theoretical models, it has always been assumed that the minimum size\nlay below the detectability limit of the measurements. In this paper we define\ngeneral glitch detectability limits and use them on 29 years of daily\nobservations of the Crab pulsar, carried out at Jodrell Bank Observatory.

Contrary to the prediction of most\nmodels, the distribution presents a rapid decrease of the number of glitches\nbelow ~0.05 $\\mu$Hz. This substantial minimum size indicates that a glitch must\ninvolve the motion of at least several billion superfluid vortices and provides\nan extra observable which can greatly help the identification of the trigger\nmechanism.

We find that the mass distribution of the whole\nsample can be well-described by a single power-law with a spectral index of\n$-1.9 \\pm 0.1$ over the range of $10^3-3 \\times 10^5 M_\\odot$. However, if we\nsubdivide the sample by galactocentric radius, we find that the age\ndistributions remain unchanged. However, the mass spectral index varies\nsignificantly, showing best fit values between $-2.2$ and $-1.8$, with the\nshallower slope in the highest star formation intensity regions. We explore the\nrobustness of our study to potential systematics and conclude that the cluster\nmass function may vary with respect to environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Feb 2014 19:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

However, WSNs system\ndesigners must fulfill the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements imposed by the\napplications (and users). Very harsh and dynamic physical environments and\nextremely limited energy/computing/memory/communication node resources are\nmajor obstacles for satisfying QoS metrics such as reliability, timeliness and\nsystem lifetime. The limited communication range of WSN nodes, link asymmetry\nand the characteristics of the physical environment lead to a major source of\nQoS degradation in WSNs. This paper proposes a Link Reliability based Two-Hop\nRouting protocol for wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The protocol achieves to\nreduce packet deadline miss ratio while consid- ering link reliability, two-hop\nvelocity and power efficiency and utilizes memory and computational effective\nmethods for estimating the link metrics. Numerical results provide insights\nthat the protocol has a lower packet deadline miss ratio and longer sensor\nnetwork lifetime. The results show that the proposed protocol is a feasible\nsolution to the QoS routing problem in wireless sensor networks that support\nreal-time applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 11:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-04"}

To understand complex networks, it is crucial to\nexplore their internal structures, also called structural regularities. The\ntask of network structure exploration is to determine how many groups in a\ncomplex network and how to group the nodes of the network. Most existing\nstructure exploration methods need to specify either a group number or a\ncertain type of structure when they are applied to a network. In the real\nworld, however, not only the group number but also the certain type of\nstructure that a network has are usually unknown in advance. To automatically\nexplore structural regularities in complex networks, without any prior\nknowledge about the group number or the certain type of structure, we extend a\nprobabilistic mixture model that can handle networks with any type of structure\nbut needs to specify a group number using Bayesian nonparametric theory and\npropose a novel Bayesian nonparametric model, called the Bayesian nonparametric\nmixture (BNPM) model. Experiments conducted on a large number of networks with\ndifferent structures show that the BNPM model is able to automatically explore\nstructural regularities in networks with a stable and state-of-the-art\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 07:37:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 05:57:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 06:18:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}
