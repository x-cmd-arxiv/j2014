RESULTS: From the spectral energy distribution,\nwe derive a bolometric luminosity of about 4x10^4 Lsun. Our interferometric\nobservations reveal that the distribution of dense gas and dust in the HMC is\nsignificantly flattened and extends up to a radius of 8000 AU from the center\nof radio continuum and maser emission in the region. The equatorial plane of\nthis HMC is strictly perpendicular to the elongation of the collimated bipolar\noutflow, as imaged on scales of about 0.1-0.5 pc in the main CO isotopomers as\nwell as in the SiO(5-4) line. In the innermost HMC regions (ca. 1000 AU), the\nvelocity field traced by the CH3CN(12_K-11_K) line emission shows that\nmolecular gas is both expanding along the outflow direction following a\nHubble-law, and rotating about the outflow axis, in agreement with the (3-D)\nvelocity field traced by methanol masers. The velocity field associated with\nrotation indicates a dynamical mass of 19 Msun at the center of the core.

Moreover, when the behavior of\na decoherent system is described from a closed-system perspective, the account\nof decoherence turns out to be more general than that supplied by the\nopen-system approach, and the quantum-to-classical transition defines\nunequivocally the realm of classicality by identifying the observables with\nclassical-like behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2014 16:45:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-17"}

The analytical and numerical\nresults exhibit a similar yet different scenario to the case of two-player\ngames: (i) with small number of players or a small multiplication factor, a\nplayer is able to unilaterally pin the expected total payoff of all other\nplayers; (ii) a player is able to set the ratio between his payoff and the\ntotal payoff of all other players, but this ratio is limited by an upper bound\nif the multiplication factor exceeds a threshold that depends on the number of\nplayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2014 17:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-17"}

We address this question by reviewing the current\nstate of observations and their key points of contact with theory. Our review\nof jet/outflow phenomena is organized into three length-scale domains: Source\nand Disk Scales ($0.1-10^2$ au) where the connection with protostellar and disk\nevolution theories is paramount; Envelope Scales ($10^2-10^5$ au) where the\nchemistry and propagation shed further light on the jet launching process, its\nvariability and its impact on the infalling envelope; Parent Cloud Scales\n($10^5-10^6$ au) where global momentum injection into cluster/cloud\nenvironments become relevant. Issues of feedback are of particular importance\non the smallest scales where planet formation regions in a disk may be impacted\nby the presence of disk winds, irradiation by jet shocks or shielding by the\nwinds. Feedback on envelope scales may determine the final stellar mass\n(core-to-star efficiency) and envelope dissipation. Feedback also plays an\nimportant role on the larger scales with outflows contributing to turbulent\nsupport within clusters including alteration of cluster star formation\nefficiencies (feedback on larger scales currently appears unlikely).

A permutation is bicrucial\nwith respect to squares if it is square-free but any extension of it to the\nright or to the left by any element gives a permutation that is not\nsquare-free.\n  Bicrucial permutations with respect to squares were studied by Avgustinovich\net al., who proved that there exist bicrucial permutations of lengths $8k+1,\n8k+5, 8k+7$ for $k\\ge 1$. It was left as open questions whether bicrucial\npermutations of even length, or such permutations of length $8k+3$ exist. In\nthis paper, we provide an encoding of orderings which allows us, using the\nconstraint solver Minion, to show that bicrucial permutations of even length\nexist, and the smallest such permutations are of length 32. To show that 32 is\nthe minimum length in question, we establish a result on left-crucial (that is,\nnot extendable to the left) square-free permutations which begin with three\nelements in monotone order. Also, we show that bicrucial permutations of length\n$8k+3$ exist for $k=2,3$ and they do not exist for $k=1$.\n  Further, we generalise the notions of right-crucial, left-crucial, and\nbicrucial permutations studied in the literature in various contexts, by\nintroducing the notion of $P$-crucial permutations that can be extended to the\nnotion of $P$-crucial words. In S-crucial permutations, a particular case of\n$P$-crucial permutations, we deal with permutations that avoid prohibitions,\nbut whose extensions in any position contain a prohibition.

Diverse models have\nbeen suggested to account for it, including ionised reflection of X-rays from\nthe inner part of the accretion disc, ionised winds/absorbers, and\nComptonisation. The ionised reflection model suggests a natural link between\nthe prominence of the soft excess and the Compton reflection hump strength\nabove 10keV, but it has not been clear what hard X-ray signatures, if any, are\nexpected from the other soft X-ray candidate models. Additionally, it has not\nbeen possible up until recently to obtain high-quality simultaneous\nmeasurements of both soft and hard X-ray emission necessary to distinguish\nthese models, but upcoming joint XMM-NuSTAR programmes provide precisely this\nopportunity. In this paper, we present an extensive analysis of simulations of\nXMM+NuSTAR observations, using two candidate soft excess models as inputs, to\ndetermine whether such campaigns can disambiguate between them by using hard\nand soft X-ray observations in tandem. The simulated spectra are fit with the\nsimplest \"observer's model\" of a black body and neutral reflection to\ncharacterise the strength of the soft and hard excesses. A plot of the strength\nof the hard excess against the soft excess strength provides a diagnostic plot\nwhich allows the soft excess production mechanism to be determined in\nindividual sources and samples using current state-of-the-art and next\ngeneration hard X-ray enabled observatories.

We find that our photometric coverage is sufficient to constrain all\nof the models parameters and that a strong constraint on the 20-60 microns\nrange is mandatory to estimate the relative contribution of the\nphoto-dissociation regions to the IR SED. The SED models tend to systematically\nunder-estimate the observed 500 microns flux densities, especially for low mass\nsystems. We provide the output parameters for all of the galaxies: the minimum\nintensity of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF), the fraction of PAH, the\nrelative contribution of PDR and evolved stellar population to the dust\nheating, the $M_{dust}$ and the $L_{IR}$. For a subsample of gas-rich galaxies,\nwe analyze the relations between these parameters and the integrated properties\nof galaxies, such as $M_*$, SFR, metallicity, H$\\alpha$ and H-band surface\nbrightness, and the FUV attenuation. A good correlation between the fraction of\nPAH and the metallicity is found implying a weakening of the PAH emission in\ngalaxies with low metallicities. The intensity of the IRSF and the H-band and\nH$\\alpha$ surface brightnesses are correlated, suggesting that the diffuse dust\ncomponent is heated by both the young stars in star forming regions and the\ndiffuse evolved population. We use these results to provide a new set of IR\ntemplates calibrated with Herschel observations on nearby galaxies and a mean\nSED template to provide the z=0 reference for cosmological studies. For the\nsame purpose, we put our sample on the SFR-$M_*$ diagram. The templates are\ncompared to the most popular IR SED libraries, enlightening a large discrepancy\nbetween all of them in the 20-100 microns range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2014 21:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-28"}

The galaxy sample is established based on a cross-comparison\nbetween public galaxy and QSO survey data and is characterized by a median\nredshift of <z>=0.041, a median projected distance of <d>=362 kpc to the\nsightline of the background QSO, and a median stellar mass of log(M_star/M_sun)\n= 9.7 \\pm 1.1. Comparing the absorber features identified in the QSO apectra\nwith known galaxy properties has led to strong constraints for the CGM\nabsorption properties at z<~0.176. First, abundant hydrogen gas is observed out\nto d~500 kpc, well beyond the dark matter halo radius Rh of individual\ngalaxies, with a mean covering fraction of ~60%. In contrast, no heavy elements\nare detected at d>~0.7 Rh from either low-mass dwarfs or high-mass galaxies.\nThe lack of detected heavy elements in low- and high-ionization states suggests\nthat either there exists a chemical enrichment edge at d~0.7 Rh or gaseous\nclumps giving rise to the observed absorption lines cannot survive at these\nlarge distances. Considering all galaxies at d>Rh leads to a strict upper limit\nfor the covering fraction of heavy elements of ~3% (at a 95% confidence level)\nover d=(1-9) Rh. At d<Rh, differential covering fraction between low- and\nhigh-ionization gas is observed, suggesting that the CGM becomes progressively\nmore ionized from d<0.3 Rh to larger distances. Comparing CGM absorption\nobservations at low and high redshifts shows that at a fixed-fraction of Rh the\nCGM exhibits stronger mean absorption at z=2.2 than at z~0.

However, service systems are generally staffed by\npeople. Furthermore, people respond to workload incentives; that is, how hard a\nperson works can depend both on how much work there is, and how the work is\ndivided between the people responsible for it. In a service system, the routing\nand staffing policies control such workload incentives; and so the rate servers\nwork will be impacted by the system's routing and staffing policies. This\nobservation has consequences when modeling service system performance, and our\nobjective is to investigate those consequences.\n  We do this in the context of the M/M/N queue, which is the canonical model\nfor large service systems. First, we present a model for \"strategic\" servers\nthat choose their service rate in order to maximize a trade-off between an\n\"effort cost\", which captures the idea that servers exert more effort when\nworking at a faster rate, and a \"value of idleness\", which assumes that servers\nvalue having idle time. Next, we characterize the symmetric Nash equilibrium\nservice rate under any routing policy that routes based on the server idle\ntime. We find that the system must operate in a quality-driven regime, in which\nservers have idle time, in order for an equilibrium to exist, which implies\nthat the staffing must have a first-order term that strictly exceeds that of\nthe common square-root staffing policy. Then, within the class of policies that\nadmit an equilibrium, we (asymptotically) solve the problem of minimizing the\ntotal cost, when there are linear staffing costs and linear waiting costs.\nFinally, we end by exploring the question of whether routing policies that are\nbased on the service rate, instead of the server idle time, can improve system\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2014 21:21:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Dec 2014 04:31:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 17:22:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 17:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-24"}

The relaxation is that the constructed subgraph is a sparse\nspanning subgraph containing at most $(1+\\epsilon)n$ edges (where $n$ is the\nnumber of vertices and $\\epsilon$ is a given approximation/sparsity parameter).\nIn the local setting, the goal is to quickly determine whether a given edge $e$\nbelongs to such a subgraph, without constructing the whole subgraph, but rather\nby inspecting (querying) the local neighborhood of $e$. The challenge is to\nmaintain consistency. That is, to provide answers concerning different edges\naccording to the same spanning subgraph. We first show that for general\nbounded-degree graphs, the query complexity of any such algorithm must be\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$. This lower bound holds for constant-degree graphs that have\nhigh expansion. Next we design an algorithm for (bounded-degree) graphs with\nhigh expansion, obtaining a result that roughly matches the lower bound.

As a\nconsequence of this interaction, it is shown that some well-known\nphenomenological population growth models (such as the Malthus, Verhulst,\nGompertz, Richards, Von Foerster, and power-law growth models) are special\ncases of the model presented herein. Moreover, other ecological behaviors can\nbe seen as the emergent behavior of such interactions. For instance, the Allee\neffect, which is the characteristic of some populations to increase the\npopulation growth rate at a small population size, is observed. Whereas the\nmodels presented in the literature explain the Allee effect with\nphenomenological ideas, the model presented here explains this effect by the\ninteractions between the individuals. The model is tested with empirical data\nto justify its formulation. Other interesting macroscopic emergent behavior\nfrom the model proposed here is the observation of a regime of population\ndivergence at a finite time. It is interesting that this characteristic is\nobserved in humanity's global population growth.

Computer vision based, i.e. automated fabric defect\ninspection systems are thought by many researchers of different countries to be\nvery useful to resolve these problems. There are two major challenges to be\nresolved to attain a successful automated fabric defect inspection system. They\nare defect detection and defect classification. In this work, we discuss\ndifferent techniques used for automated fabric defect classification, then show\na survey of classifiers used in automated fabric defect inspection systems, and\nfinally, compare these classifiers by using performance metrics.
