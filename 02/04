However the realness of the entire\nspectrum can be preserved over a finite interval if additional discrete\nsymmetries X are imposed when T is broken, if X decouple all degenerate modes.\nWhen this is true only for a subset of the degenerate spectrum, there can be a\npartial PT transition in which this subset remains real over a finite interval\nof T-breaking. If the spectrum has odd-degeneracy, a fraction of the degenerate\nspectrum can remain in the symmetric phase even without imposing additional\ndiscrete symmetries, and they are analogous to dark states in atomic physics.\nThese results are illustrated by the example of different T-breaking\nperturbations of a uniform dielectric disk and sphere, and a group theoretical\nanalysis is given in the disk case.

An illustrative example important for genomic stability is the\nlength regulation of telomeres---nucleo-protein structures at the ends of\nlinear chromosomes. Maintenance of telomeres is often facilitated by the enzyme\ntelomerase but, particularly in telomerase-free systems, the maintenance of\nchromosomal termini depends on alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)\nmechanisms mediated by recombination. Various linear and circular DNA\nstructures were identified to participate in ALT, however, dynamics of the\nwhole process is still poorly understood. We propose a chemical kinetics model\nof ALT with kinetic rates systematically derived from the biophysics of DNA\ndiffusion and looping. The reaction system is reduced to a\ncoagulation-fragmentation system by quasi-steady state approximation. The\ndetailed treatment of kinetic rates yields explicit formulae for expected size\ndistributions of telomeres that demonstrate the key role played by the\nJ-factor, a quantitative measure of bending of polymers. The results are in\nagreement with experimental data and point out interesting phenomena: an\nappearance of very long telomeric circles if the total telomere density exceeds\na critical value (excess mass) and a nonlinear response of the telomere size\ndistributions to the amount of telomeric DNA in the system.

We then use the DFT+U potential to search the\nconfiguration space and locate the lowest energy STH configuration. It is\ndemonstrated that both the DFT+U potential and the hybrid functional yield a\npiece-wise linear dependence of the total energy on the occupation of the STH\nlevel suggesting that self-interaction effects have been properly removed. The\nDFT+U model is found to be transferable to BaTiO3 and PbTiO3, and formation\nenergies from DFT+U and hybrid calculations are in close agreement for all\nthree materials. STH formation is found to be energetically favorable in SrTiO3\nand BaTiO3 but not in PbTiO3, which can be rationalized by considering the\nalignment of the valence band edges on an absolute energy scale.

One major challenge in FGVC is\nthe co-occurrence of two issues: 1) many subordinate classes are highly\ncorrelated and are difficult to distinguish, and 2) there exists the large\nintra-class variation (e.g., due to object pose). This paper proposes to\nexplicitly address the above two issues via distance metric learning (DML). DML\naddresses the first issue by learning an embedding so that data points from the\nsame class will be pulled together while those from different classes should be\npushed apart from each other; and it addresses the second issue by allowing the\nflexibility that only a portion of the neighbors (not all data points) from the\nsame class need to be pulled together. However, feature representation of an\nimage is often high dimensional, and DML is known to have difficulty in dealing\nwith high dimensional feature vectors since it would require $\\mathcal{O}(d^2)$\nfor storage and $\\mathcal{O}(d^3)$ for optimization.

Their strong gravity suggests\nthat they can also be used to constrain gravity models. The mass and radius\n(M-R) of a NS both depend on the choice of EoS and gravity, meaning that NSs\ncannot be simultaneously good laboratories for both of these questions. A\nmeasurement of M-R would constrain the less well known physics input. The\nassumption that M-R measurements can be used to constrain EoS-presumes general\nrelativity (GR) is the ultimate model of gravity in the classical regime. We\ncalculate the radial profile of compactness and curvature (square root of the\nfull contraction of the Weyl tensor) within a NS and determine the domain not\nprobed by the Solar System tests of GR. We find that, except for a tiny sphere\nof radius less than a millimeter at the center, the curvature is several orders\nof magnitude above the values present in Solar System tests. The compactness is\nbeyond the solar surface value for r>10 m, and increases by 5 orders of\nmagnitude towards the surface. With the density being only an order of\nmagnitude higher than that probed by nuclear scattering experiments, our\nresults suggest that the employment of GR as the theory of gravity describing\nthe hydrostatic equilibrium of NSs is a rather remarkable extrapolation from\nthe regime of tested validity, as opposed to that of EoS models. Our larger\nignorance of gravity within NSs suggests that a measurement of M-R constrains\ngravity rather than EoS, and given that EoS has yet to be determined by nucleon\nscattering experiments, M-R measurements cannot tightly constrain the gravity\nmodels either.

Thus, not only typical\nquantities like average or variance but the distributions over the (almost)\nfull support can be studied. For a proof of principle, a simple transport model\nbased on the edge-betweenness and three abstract yet widely studied random\nnetwork ensembles are considered here: Erdoes-Renyi random networks with finite\nconnectivity, small world networks and spatial networks embedded in a\ntwo-dimensional plane. Using specific numerical large-deviation techniques,\nprobability densities as small as 10^(-80) are obtained here. This allows one\nto study typical but also the most and the least resilient networks. The\nresulting distributions fulfill the mathematical large-deviation principle,\ni.e., can be well described by rate functions in the thermodynamic limit. The\nanalysis of the limiting rate function reveals that the resilience follows an\nexponential distribution almost everywhere. An analysis of the structure of the\nnetwork shows that the most-resilient networks can be obtained, as a rule of\nthumb, by minimizing the diameter of a network. Also, trivially, by including\nmore links a network can typically be made more resilient. On the other hand,\nthe least-resilient networks are very rare and characterized by one (or few)\nsmall core(s) to which all other nodes are connected. In total, the spatial\nnetwork ensemble turns out to be most suitable for obtaining and studying\nresilience of real mostly finite-dimensional networks.

This allows us to categorize finite\ngroups into three types: (i) Groups that do not exhibit such an automorphism\nand, therefore, in generic settings, explicitly violate CP. In settings based\non such groups, CP violation can have pure group-theoretic origin and can be\nrelated to the complexity of some Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

With modern metagenomic sequencing methods it is possible\nto follow the relative abundance of microbes in a community over time. These\nmicrobial communities exhibit rich ecological dynamics and an important goal of\nmicrobial ecology is to infer the interactions between species from sequence\ndata. Any algorithm for inferring species interactions must overcome three\nobstacles: 1) a correlation between the abundances of two species does not\nimply that those species are interacting, 2) the sum constraint on the relative\nabundances obtained from metagenomic studies makes it difficult to infer the\nparameters in timeseries models, and 3) errors due to experimental uncertainty,\nor mis-assignment of sequencing reads into operational taxonomic units, bias\ninferences of species interactions. Here we introduce an approach, Learning\nInteractions from MIcrobial Time Series (LIMITS), that overcomes these\nobstacles. LIMITS uses sparse linear regression with boostrap aggregation to\ninfer a discrete-time Lotka-Volterra model for microbial dynamics. We tested\nLIMITS on synthetic data and showed that it could reliably infer the topology\nof the inter-species ecological interactions. We then used LIMITS to\ncharacterize the species interactions in the gut microbiomes of two individuals\nand found that the interaction networks varied significantly between\nindividuals.

Given the non stationarity\ninduced by the fading process, an online solution for the formulated game would\nthen require an adaptive procedure capable of both convergence to and tracking\nstrategic equilibria as the environment changes. To this end, we deploy the\nstrategic and non stationary learning algorithm of regret tracking, the\ntemporally adaptive variant of the celebrated regret matching algorithm, to\nguarantee the emergence and active tracking of the correlated equilibria in the\ndynamic robust forwarding game. We also make provision for exploiting the\nchannel state information, when available, to enhance the convergence speed of\nthe learning algorithm by conducting an accurate transmission cost estimation.\nThis cost estimate can basically serve as a model which spares the algorithm\nfrom extra action exploration, thus rendering the learning process more sample\nefficient.

The most widely used\nheuristic is the relaxation of metric fluents into interval-valued variables\n--- an idea first proposed a decade ago. Other heuristics depend on domain\nencodings that supply additional information about fluents, such as capacity\nconstraints or other resource-related annotations. A particular challenge to\nthese approaches is in handling interactions between metric fluents that\nrepresent exchange, such as the transformation of quantities of raw materials\ninto quantities of processed goods, or trading of money for materials. The\nusual relaxation of metric fluents is often very poor in these situations,\nsince it does not recognise that resources, once spent, are no longer available\nto be spent again. We present a heuristic for numeric planning problems\nbuilding on the propositional relaxed planning graph, but using a mathematical\nprogram for numeric reasoning. We define a class of producer--consumer planning\nproblems and demonstrate how the numeric constraints in these can be modelled\nin a mixed integer program (MIP). This MIP is then combined with a metric\nRelaxed Planning Graph (RPG) heuristic to produce an integrated hybrid\nheuristic. The MIP tracks resource use more accurately than the usual\nrelaxation, but relaxes the ordering of actions, while the RPG captures the\ncausal propositional aspects of the problem. We discuss how these two\ncomponents interact to produce a single unified heuristic and go on to explore\nhow further numeric features of planning problems can be integrated into the\nMIP. We show that encoding a limited subset of the propositional problem to\naugment the MIP can yield more accurate guidance, partly by exploiting\nstructure such as propositional landmarks and propositional resources. Our\nresults show that the use of this heuristic enhances scalability on problems\nwhere numeric resource interaction is key in finding a solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-05"}

Local\nsearch has proved successful for this problem. However, there are two main\ndrawbacks in state-of-the-art MVC local search algorithms. First, they select a\npair of vertices to exchange simultaneously, which is time-consuming. Secondly,\nalthough using edge weighting techniques to diversify the search, these\nalgorithms lack mechanisms for decreasing the weights. To address these issues,\nwe propose two new strategies: two-stage exchange and edge weighting with\nforgetting. The two-stage exchange strategy selects two vertices to exchange\nseparately and performs the exchange in two stages. The strategy of edge\nweighting with forgetting not only increases weights of uncovered edges, but\nalso decreases some weights for each edge periodically.

For the transit of an Earth twin, models\npredict that biogenic $O_2$ and $O_3$ should be detectable, as well as water\nvapour, a molecule linked to habitability as we know it on Earth. The aim is to\nmeasure the Earth radius versus wavelength $\\lambda$ - or the atmosphere\nthickness $h(\\lambda)$ - at the highest spectral resolution available to fully\ncharacterize the signature of Earth seen as a transiting exoplanet. We present\nobservations of the Moon eclipse of 21-12-2010. Seen from the Moon, the Earth\neclipses the Sun and opens access to the Earth atmosphere transmission\nspectrum. We used HARPS and UVES spectrographs to take penumbra and umbra\nhigh-resolution spectra from 3100 to 10400 Ang. A change of the quantity of\nwater vapour above the telescope compromised the quality of the UVES data. We\ncorrected for this effect in the data processing. We analyzed the data by 3\ndifferent methods. The 1st method is based on the analysis of pairs of penumbra\nspectra. The 2nd makes use of a single penumbra spectrum, and the 3rd of all\npenumbra and umbra spectra. Profiles $h(\\lambda)$ are obtained with the three\nmethods for both instruments. The 1st method gives the best result, in\nagreement with a model. The second method seems to be more sensitive to the\nDoppler shift of solar spectral lines with respect to the telluric lines. The\n3rd method makes use of umbra spectra which bias the result, but it can be\ncorrected for this a posteriori from results with the first method. The 3\nmethods clearly show the spectral signature of the Rayleigh scattering in the\nEarth atmosphere and the bands of H$_2$O, O$_2$, and O$_3$. Sodium is detected.\nAssuming no atmospheric perturbations, we show that the E-ELT is theoretically\nable to detect the $O_2$ A-band in 8~h of integration for an Earth twin at\n10pc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 02:04:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2014 19:44:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

It\nunifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance\nof using contextual information in scene labeling frameworks has been widely\nrealized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual\nhierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical\nframework for scene labeling. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is\ntrained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our\nmodel then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information\ninto a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This\ntraining strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at\nmultiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is\npurely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments\nor shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as\nobject segmentation and edge detection. We demonstrate that CHM outperforms\nstate-of-the-art on Stanford background and Weizmann horse datasets. It also\noutperforms state-of-the-art edge detection methods on NYU depth dataset and\nachieves state-of-the-art on Berkeley segmentation dataset (BSDS 500).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 02:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-05"}

Our interest is motivated by the potential use of such sets in\nthe \"stress testing\" of insurance companies and banks whose solvency is\ndependent on changes in a set of financial \"risk factors\". We define\nmultivariate scenario sets based on the notion of half-space depth (HD) and\nalso introduce the notion of expectile depth (ED) where half-spaces are defined\nby expectiles rather than quantiles. We then use the HD and ED functions to\ndefine convex scenario sets that generalize the concepts of quantile and\nexpectile to higher dimensions. In the case of elliptical distributions these\nsets coincide with the regions encompassed by the contours of the density\nfunction. In the context of multivariate skewed distributions, the equivalence\nof depth contours and density contours does not hold in general. We consider\ntwo parametric families that account for skewness and heavy tails: the\ngeneralized hyperbolic and the skew-t distributions. By making use of a\ncanonical form representation, where skewness is completely absorbed by one\ncomponent, we show that the HD contours of these distributions are\n\"near-elliptical\" and, in the case of the skew-Cauchy distribution, we prove\nthat the HD contours are exactly elliptical. We propose a measure of\nmultivariate skewness as a deviation from angular symmetry and show that it can\nexplain the quality of the elliptical approximation for the HD contours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 10:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-05"}

Purpose and scope of\nthis paper is to explore the possibility to extend this finding to a general\nrelativity context. For simplicity we restrict our consideration to the case of\nhomogeneous and isotropic metrics and show that, via an approach analogous to\nthat used for the nonrelativistic many-body problem, a class of homogeneous and\nisotropic cyclic solutions of Einstein's equations may be obtained. For these\nsolutions the duration of the cycles does not depend on the initial conditions,\nso we call these models isochronous cosmologies. We give a physical\ninterpretation of such metrics and in particular we show that they may behave\narbitrarily closely, or even identically, to the Friedman-Robertson-Walker\nsolutions of Einstein's equations for an arbitrarily long time (of course\nshorter than their period, which can also be assigned arbitrarily), so that\nthey may reproduce all the satisfactory phenomenological features of the\nstandard cosmological $\\Lambda $-CDM model in a portion of their cycle; while\nthese isochronous cosmologies may be geodesically complete and therefore\nsingularity-free.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 12:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 May 2014 15:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-07"}

We performed a multi-variable\nanalysis covering a wide range of stellar structure and seismic properties and\nmodel parameters representative of intermediate-mass, main sequence stars. The\nwork-flow is entirely done using a new Virtual Observatory tool: TOUCAN (the VO\ngateway for asteroseismic models), which is presented in this paper. A linear\nrelation between the large separation and the mean density is predicted to be\nfound in the low frequency frequency domain (i.e. radial orders spanning from 1\nto 8, approximately) of the main-sequence, delta Scuti stars' oscillation\nspectrum. We found that such a linear behavior stands whatever the mass,\nmetallicity, mixing length, and overshooting parameters considered in this\nwork. The intrinsic error of the method is discussed. This includes the\nuncertainty in the large separation determination and the role of rotation. The\nvalidity of the relation found is only guaranteed for stars rotating up to 40\npercent of their break-up velocity. Finally, we applied the diagnostic method\npresented in this work to five stars for which regular patterns have been\nfound. Our estimates for the mean density and the frequency of the fundamental\nradial mode match with those given in the literature within a 20 percent of\ndeviation. Asteroseismology has thus revealed an independent direct measure of\nthe average density of delta Scuti stars, analogous to that of the Sun. This\nplaces tight constraints on the mode identification and hence on the stellar\ninternal structure and dynamics, and allows a determination the radius of\nplanets orbiting around delta Scuti stars with unprecedented precision.

We measure that the linear size of spots or stars,\nof typical size 3 to 4 pixels FWHM, increase linearly with their flux by up to\n$2\\%$ over the full CCD dynamic range. This brighter-fatter effect affects both\ndeep-depleted and thinned CCD sensors. We propose that this effect is a direct\nconsequence of the distortions of the drift electric field sourced by charges\naccumulated within the CCD during the exposure and experienced by forthcoming\nlight-induced charges in the same exposure. The pixel boundaries then become\nslightly dynamical: overfilled pixels become increasingly smaller than their\nneighbors, so that bright star sizes, measured in number of pixels, appear\nlarger than those of faint stars. This interpretation of the brighter-fatter\neffect implies that pixels in flat-fields should exhibit statistical\ncorrelations, sourced by Poisson fluctuations, that we indeed directly detect.\nWe propose to use the measured correlations in flat-fields to derive how pixel\nboundaries shift under the influence of a given charge pattern, which allows us\nto quantitatively predict how star shapes evolve with flux. This physical model\nof the brighter-fatter effect also explains the commonly observed phenomenon\nthat the spatial variance of CCD flat-fields increases less rapidly than their\naverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 13:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Another strand of tagging research reveals a strong\nimpact of time dependent forgetting on users' tag choices, such that recently\nused tags have a higher probability being reused than \"older\" tags. In this\npaper, we align both strands by implementing a computational theory of human\nmemory that integrates the two-level conception and the process of forgetting\nin form of a tag recommender and test it in three large-scale social tagging\ndatasets (drawn from BibSonomy, CiteULike and Flickr).\n  As expected, our results reveal a selective effect of time: forgetting is\nmuch more pronounced on the lexical level of tags.

Further, we show that the long-term evolution of\nthe system can be predicted using adaptive dynamics. By comparing the results\nfrom a spatially structured vs.\\ well-mixed population we show that spatial\nstructure restores selection for carrying capacity even at zero specificity,\nwhich a poses solution to the niche construction dilemma. Lastly, we show that\nan expanding population exhibits spatially variable selection pressure, where\ncells at the leading edge exhibit higher growth rate and lower carrying\ncapacity than those at the centre of the tumour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 15:12:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2015 08:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-02"}

It is of great interest to understand the underlying\ndistribution and geometric structure of given spike train data. However, a\nfundamental obstacle is that the space of all spike trains is not an Euclidean\nspace, and non-Euclidean metrics have been commonly used in the literature to\ncharacterize the variability and pattern in neural observations. Over the past\nfew years, two Euclidean-like metrics were independently developed to measure\ndistance in the spike train space. An important benefit of these metrics is\nthat the spike train space will be suitable for embedding in Euclidean spaces\ndue to their Euclidean properties. In this paper, we systematically compare\nthese two metrics on theory, properties, and applications. Because of its\nEuclidean properties, one of these metrics has been further used in defining\nsummary statistics (i.e. mean and variance) and conducting statistical\ninferences in the spike train space. Here we provide equivalent definitions\nusing the other metric and show that consistent statistical inferences can be\nconducted.

The very small $x$ behavior of the\ngluon distribution is obtained by solving the Gribov, Levin, Ryskin, Mueller\nand Qiu (GLR-MQ) evolution equation with the nonlinear shadowing term\nincorporated. The form of initial condition for the equation is determined. We\nfind, with decreasing $x$, the emergence of a singular behavior and the\neventual taming (at $R=5\\hspace{0.1cm}GeV^{-1}$) and the essential taming (at\n$R=2\\hspace{0.1cm}GeV^{-1}$) of this singular behavior by shadowing term. The\nnonlinear gluon density functions are calculated and compared with the results\nfor the integrated gluon density from the Balitsky- Kovchegov(BK) equation for\nthe different values of $Q^{2}$. It is shown, that the results for the gluon\ndensity function are comparable with the results obtained from BK equation\nsolution. Also we show that for each $x$, the $Q^{2}$ dependence of the data is\nwell described by gluon shadowing corrections to GLR-MQ equation. The resulting\nanalytic expression allow us to predict the logarithmic derivative\n$\\frac{{\\partial}F^{s}_{2}(x,Q^{2})}{{\\partial}lnQ^{2}}$ and to compare the\nresults with H1 data and a QCD analysis fit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 15:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-06"}

Inspired by\nobservation of the empirical particle mass spectrum, and their corresponding\nphysical interaction couplings, we propose that the masses of elementary\nparticles arise solely due to the self-interaction of the fields associated\nwith the charges of a particle. A first application of this idea is seen to\nyield correct order of magnitude predictions for neutrinos, charged leptons and\nquarks. We then discuss more ambitious models, where also different generations\nmay arise from \\textit{e.g.} self-organizing bifurcations due to the underlying\nnon-linear dynamics, with the coupling strength acting as \"non-linearity\"\nparameter. If the model is extended to include gauge bosons, the photon is\nautomatically the only fundamental particle to remain massless as it has no\ncharges. It results that gluons have an effective range $\\sim 1$fm, physically\nexplaining why QCD has finite reach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 11:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-28"}

This problem can be solved using the chase algorithm, which extends\nthe given set of facts with fresh facts in order to satisfy the rules. If the\nchase terminates, then CQs can be evaluated directly in the resulting set of\nfacts. The chase, however, does not terminate necessarily, and checking whether\nthe chase terminates on a given set of rules and facts is undecidable. Numerous\nacyclicity notions were proposed as sufficient conditions for chase\ntermination. In this paper, we present two new acyclicity notions called\nmodel-faithful acyclicity (MFA) and model-summarising acyclicity (MSA).\nFurthermore, we investigate the landscape of the known acyclicity notions and\nestablish a complete taxonomy of all notions known to us. Finally, we show that\nMFA and MSA generalise most of these notions.\n  Existential rules are closely related to the Horn fragments of the OWL 2\nontology language; furthermore, several prominent OWL 2 reasoners implement CQ\nanswering by using the chase to materialise all relevant facts. In order to\navoid termination problems, many of these systems handle only the OWL 2 RL\nprofile of OWL 2; furthermore, some systems go beyond OWL 2 RL, but without any\ntermination guarantees. In this paper we also investigate whether various\nacyclicity notions can provide a principled and practical solution to these\nproblems. On the theoretical side, we show that query answering for acyclic\nontologies is of lower complexity than for general ontologies. On the practical\nside, we show that many of the commonly used OWL 2 ontologies are MSA, and that\nthe number of facts obtained by materialisation is not too large. Our results\nthus suggest that principled development of materialisation-based OWL 2\nreasoners is practically feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-17"}
