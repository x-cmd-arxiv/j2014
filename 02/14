Here, we show\nthat it actually performs a simultaneous measurement of position and angular\nspectrum of the incident radiation and, therefore, when combined with\ntomographic techniques previously developed for quantum information processing,\nthe Shack-Hartmann can be instrumental in reconstructing the complete coherence\nproperties of the signal.

One example of such matrices are the randomly selected discrete\nFourier transform (DFT) matrices. Such selection enjoys a less memory\ncomplexity and a faster multiplication procedure. Our contributions are the\nreplica calculations to find the mean-square-error (MSE) of the Bayes-optimal\nreconstruction for such setup. We illustrate that the reconstruction thresholds\nunder the spatially-coupled orthogonal and Gaussian ensembles are quite\ndifferent especially in the noisy cases. In particular, the spatially coupled\northogonal matrices achieve the faster convergence rate, the lower measurement\nrate, and the reduced MSE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 17:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-14"}

This capability\ncan be enhanced through a new statistical measure of association and\ncorrelation, called the {\\it distance correlation coefficient}, which has more\nstatistical power to detect associations than does the classical Pearson\nmeasure of linear relationships between two variables. The distance correlation\nmeasure offers a more precise alternative to the classical measure since it is\ncapable of detecting nonlinear relationships that may appear in astrophysical\napplications. We showed recently that the comparison between the distance and\nPearson correlation coefficients can be used effectively to isolate potential\noutliers in various galaxy datasets, and this comparison has the ability to\nconfirm the level of accuracy associated with the data. In this work, we\nelucidate the advantages of distance correlation when applied to large\ndatabases. We illustrate how the distance correlation measure can be used\neffectively as a tool to confirm nonlinear relationships between various\nvariables in the COMBO-17 database, including the lengths of the major and\nminor axes, and the alternative redshift distribution. For these outlier pairs,\nthe distance correlation coefficient is routinely higher than the Pearson\ncoefficient since it is easier to detect nonlinear relationships with distance\ncorrelation.

We investigate its applicability to\nexisting dispersive long-slit spectrographs, identified here by their plate\nscale, and the size of the resulting stellar sample. The stellar rotation\ninduces a tilt in the stellar lines whose angle depends on the stellar position\nangle and the orientation of the slit. We developed a rotation model to\ncalculate and reproduce the effects of stellar rotation on unreduced high\nresolution stellar spectra.

To avoid such problems, we introduce a\ngraph-theoretical method for the computation of iso-surfaces on cuboid meshes\nin $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The method for the generation of iso-surfaces employs\nlabeled cuboid graphs $G(V,E,\\mathcal{F})$ such that $V$ is the set of vertices\nof a cuboid $C\\subset\\mathbb{R}^3$, $E$ is the set of edges of $C$ and\n$\\mathcal{F}\\,:\\,V\\rightarrow [0,1]$. The nodes of $G$ are weighted by the\nvalues of $\\mathcal{F}$ which represents the volumetric information, e.g.\\ from\na Volume of Fluid method.

The graph-theoretical method for the computation of iso-surfaces\ndeveloped in this paper enables to recover local information of the iso-surface\nthat can be used e.g.\\ to compute discrete mean curvature and to solve surface\nPDEs.

Although both the electron\nspin and the structure of the local orbitals play a key role in this physics,\nin most systems these are connected only indirectly --- via the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple and the Coulomb interaction. Iridium-based oxides (iridates) open a\nfurther dimension to this problem by introducing strong spin-orbit\ninteractions, such that the Mott physics has a strong orbital character. In the\nlayered honeycomb iridates this is thought to generate highly spin-anisotropic\ninteractions, coupling the spin orientation to a given spatial direction of\nexchange and leading to strongly frustrated magnetism. The potential for new\nphysics emerging from such interactions has driven much scientific excitement,\nmost recently in the search for a new quantum spin liquid, first discussed by\nKitaev \\cite{kitaev_anyons_2006}. Here we report a new iridate structure that\nhas the same local connectivity as the layered honeycomb, but in a\nthree-dimensional framework. The temperature dependence of the magnetic\nsusceptibility exhibits a striking reordering of the magnetic anisotropy,\ngiving evidence for highly spin-anisotropic exchange interactions.

The new version of the Besancon Galaxy model (hereafter BGM) aims to\nprovide a more flexible and powerful tool to investigate the initial mass\nfunction (IMF) and star formation rate (SFR) of the Galactic disc. We present a\nnew strategy for the generation of thin disc stars, which assumes the IMF, SFR\nand evolutionary tracks as free parameters. We have updated most of the\ningredients for the star count production and, for the first time, binary stars\nare generated in a consistent way. The local dynamical self-consistency is\nmaintained in this new scheme. We then compare simulations from the new model\nwith Tycho-2 data and the local luminosity function, as a first test to verify\nand constrain the new ingredients. The effects of changing thirteen different\ningredients of the model are systematically studied. For the first time, a full\nsky comparison is performed between BGM and data. This strategy allows us to\nconstrain the IMF slope at high masses, which is found to be close to 3.0 and\nexcludes a shallower slope such as Salpeter's one. The SFR is found decreasing\nwhatever IMF is assumed. The model is compatible with a local dark matter\ndensity of 0.011 Mo/pc^3 implying that there is no compelling evidence for the\nsignificant amount of dark matter in the disc. While the model is fitted to\nTycho-2 data, which is a magnitude limited sample with V<11, we check that it\nis still consistent with fainter stars.

Calibrating proxies for cluster\nmass will be crucial to cluster cosmology with upcoming surveys like eROSITA\nand Euclid. The recent Planck results led to suggestions that X-ray masses\nmight be biased low by $\\sim\\!40$ %, more than previously considered. We extend\nthe direct calibration of the weak lensing -- X-ray mass scaling towards lower\nmasses (as low as $1\\!\\times\\!10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$) in a sample\nrepresentative of the $z\\!\\sim\\!0.4$--$0.5$ population.

Overall, we\nfind good agreement between WL and X-ray masses, with different mass bias\nestimators all consistent with zero. Subdividing the sample, we find the\nhigh-mass subsample to show no significant mass bias while for the low-mass\nsubsample, there is a bias towards overestimated X-ray masses at the\n$\\sim\\!2\\sigma$ level for some mass proxies. The overall scatter in the\nmass-mass scaling relations is surprisingly low. Neither observation can be\ntraced back to the parameter settings in the WL analysis.

The high angular resolution of the ALMA\nimaging allows secure counterparts to be identified in the CANDELS multiband\ndataset. The CANDELS data provide deep photometric data from UV through\nnear-infrared wavelengths. Using synthetic spectral energy distributions, we\nderive photometric redshifts, stellar masses, extinction, ages, and the star\nformation history. The redshift range is z=1.65-4.76, with two of the galaxies\nlocated at z>4. Two SMG counterparts have stellar masses 2-3 orders of\nmagnitude lower than the rest. The remaining SMG counterparts have stellar\nmasses around 1x10^11 Msun. The stellar population in the SMGs is typically\nolder than the expected duration of the submillimeter phase, suggesting that\nthe star formation history of submillimeter galaxies is more complex than a\nsingle burst.

The SFR-dependence of the slope of the TH-IGIMF is found to be key\nto reproducing the correct [a/Fe]-stellar mass relation. Massive galaxies reach\nhigher [a/Fe] abundance ratios because they are characterized by more top-heavy\nIMFs as a result of their higher SFR. As a consequence of our analysis, the\nvalue of the minimum embedded star cluster mass and of the slope of the\nembedded cluster mass function, which are free parameters involved in the\nTH-IGIMF theory, are found to be as low as 5 solar masses and 2, respectively.\nA mild downsizing trend is present for galaxies generated assuming either a\nuniversal IMF or a variable TH-IGIMF. We find that, regardless of galaxy mass,\nolder galaxies (with formation redshifts > 2) are formed in shorter time-scales\n(< 2 Gyr), thus achieving larger [a/Fe] values. Hence, the time-scale of galaxy\nformation alone cannot explain the slope of the [a/Fe]-galaxy mass relation,\nbut is responsible for the big dispersion of [a/Fe] abundance ratios at fixed\nstellar mass.We further test the hyphothesis of a TH-IGIMF in elliptical\ngalaxies by looking into mass-to-light ratios, and luminosity functions.

In\nrapidly adapting microbial populations, this process is particularly hard to\npredict because lineages with different beneficial mutations often spread\nsimultaneously and interfere with one another's fixation. Hence to predict the\nfate of any individual variant, we must know the rate at which new mutations\ncreate competing lineages of higher fitness. Here, we directly measured the\neffect of this interference on the fates of specific adaptive variants in\nlaboratory Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations and used these measurements to\ninfer the distribution of fitness effects of new beneficial mutations. To do\nso, we seeded marked lineages with different fitness advantages into replicate\npopulations and tracked their subsequent frequencies for hundreds of\ngenerations. Our results illustrate the transition between strongly\nadvantageous lineages which decisively sweep to fixation and more moderately\nadvantageous lineages that are often outcompeted by new mutations arising\nduring the course of the experiment. We developed an approximate likelihood\nframework to compare our data to simulations and found that the effects of\nthese competing beneficial mutations were best approximated by an exponential\ndistribution, rather than one with a single effect size.

The adoption of reputation\nsystems, however, relies on their ability to capture the actual trustworthiness\nof a target. Several reputation models for aggregating trust information have\nbeen proposed in the literature. The choice of model has an impact on the\nreliability of the aggregated trust information as well as on the procedure\nused to compute reputations. Two prominent models are flow-based reputation\n(e.g., EigenTrust, PageRank) and Subjective Logic based reputation. Flow-based\nmodels provide an automated method to aggregate trust information, but they are\nnot able to express the level of uncertainty in the information. In contrast,\nSubjective Logic extends probabilistic models with an explicit notion of\nuncertainty, but the calculation of reputation depends on the structure of the\ntrust network and often requires information to be discarded. These are severe\ndrawbacks.\n  In this work, we observe that the `opinion discounting' operation in\nSubjective Logic has a number of basic problems. We resolve these problems by\nproviding a new discounting operator that describes the flow of evidence from\none party to another. The adoption of our discounting rule results in a\nconsistent Subjective Logic algebra that is entirely based on the handling of\nevidence. We show that the new algebra enables the construction of an automated\nreputation assessment procedure for arbitrary trust networks, where the\ncalculation no longer depends on the structure of the network, and does not\nneed to throw away any information.

Here, using mathematical deduction and\nnumerical simulation, we made an attempt to uncover the underlying mechanisms\ndetermining the effectiveness of variation partitioning techniques. The\ncovariance among independent variables determines the under-fitting and\nover-fitting problem with the variation partitioning process. Ideally, it is\nassumed that the covariance among independent variables will be zero (no\ncorrelation at all), however, typically there will be some colinearities.\nTherefore, we analyzed the role of slight covariance on influencing species\nvariation partitioning. We concluded that when the covariance between spatial\nand environmental predictors is positive, all the three components-pure\nenvironmental, spatial variations and mixed covariation were over-fitted, with\nthe sign of the true covariation being negative. In contrast, when the\ncovariance is negative, all the three components were under-fitted with the\nsign of true covariation being positive. Other factors, including extra noise\nlevels, the strengths of variable coefficients and the patterns of landscape\ngradients, could reduce the fitting problems caused by the covariance of\nvariables. The conventional calculation of mixed covariation is incorrect and\nmisleading, as the true and estimated covariations are always sign-opposite.

The theory of differential privacy is an\nactive research area, and there are now differentially private algorithms for a\nwide range of interesting problems.\n  However, the question of when differential privacy works in practice has\nreceived relatively little attention. In particular, there is still no rigorous\nmethod for choosing the key parameter $\\epsilon$, which controls the crucial\ntradeoff between the strength of the privacy guarantee and the accuracy of the\npublished results.\n  In this paper, we examine the role that these parameters play in concrete\napplications, identifying the key questions that must be addressed when\nchoosing specific values. This choice requires balancing the interests of two\ndifferent parties: the data analyst and the prospective participant, who must\ndecide whether to allow their data to be included in the analysis. We propose a\nsimple model that expresses this balance as formulas over a handful of\nparameters, and we use our model to choose $\\epsilon$ on a series of simple\nstatistical studies. We also explore a surprising insight: in some\ncircumstances, a differentially private study can be more accurate than a\nnon-private study for the same cost, under our model.

A unified\nalgorithm, endowed with two distinct ranking schemes for grading component\nfunctions, was created for their numerical implementation. The fully\nadaptive-sparse PDD method is comprehensive and rigorous, leading to the\nsecond-moment statistics of a stochastic response that converges to the exact\nsolution when the tolerances vanish. A partially adaptive-sparse PDD method,\nobtained through regulated adaptivity and sparsity, is economical and is,\ntherefore, expected to solve practical problems with numerous variables.\nCompared with past developments, the adaptive-sparse PDD methods do not require\nits truncation parameter(s) to be assigned \\emph{a priori} or arbitrarily. The\nnumerical results reveal that an adaptive-sparse PDD method achieves a desired\nlevel of accuracy with considerably fewer coefficients compared with existing\nPDD approximations.

In the method, the\nmaximum passband ripple and minimum stopband attenuation are ensured to be\nwithin prescribed levels, while at the same time maintaining a good\nlinear-phase characteristic at a prescribed group delay in the passband. Since\nthe beamformer is intended primarily for small-sized microphone arrays where\nthe microphone spacing is small relative to the wavelength at low frequencies,\nthe beamformer can become highly sensitive to spatial white noise and array\nimperfections if a direct minimization of the error is performed. Therefore, to\nlimit the sensitivity of the beamformer the optimization is carried out by\nconstraining a sensitivity parameter, namely, the white noise gain (WNG) to be\nabove prescribed levels across the frequency band. Two novel design variants\nhave been developed. The first variant is formulated as a convex optimization\nproblem where the maximum error in the passband is minimized, while the second\nvariant is formulated as an iterative optimization problem and has the\nadvantage of significantly improving the linear-phase characteristics of the\nbeamformer under any prescribed group delay or linear-array configuration. In\nthe second variant, the passband group-delay deviation is minimized while\nensuring that the maximum passband ripple and stopband attenuation are within\nprescribed levels. To reduce the computational effort in carrying out the\noptimization, a nonuniform variable sampling approach over the frequency and\nangular dimensions is used to compute the required parameters. Experiment\nresults show that beamformers designed using the proposed methods have much\nsmaller passband group-delay deviation for similar passband ripple and stopband\nattenuation than a modified version of an existing method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 22:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture is an\ninstance of ICN that is being developed as a candidate next-generation Internet\narchitecture. By opportunistically caching content within the network (in\nrouters), NDN appears to be well-suited for large-scale content distribution\nand for meeting the needs of increasingly mobile and bandwidth-hungry\napplications that dominate today's Internet.\n  One key feature of NDN is the requirement for each content object to be\ndigitally signed by its producer. Thus, NDN should be, in principle, immune to\ndistributing fake (aka \"poisoned\") content. However, in practice, this poses\ntwo challenges for detecting fake content in NDN routers: (1) overhead due to\nsignature verification and certificate chain traversal, and (2) lack of trust\ncontext, i.e., determining which public keys are trusted to verify which\ncontent. Because of these issues, NDN does not force routers to verify content\nsignatures, which makes the architecture susceptible to content poisoning\nattacks.\n  This paper explores root causes of, and some cures for, content poisoning\nattacks in NDN. In the process, it becomes apparent that meaningful mitigation\nof content poisoning is contingent upon a network-layer trust management\narchitecture, elements of which we construct while carefully justifying\nspecific design choices.

Departing from the existing approaches that\nrequire the query set to be specified in advance, we advocate to devise\nquery-set independent mechanisms, with an ambitious goal of providing accurate\nanswers, while meeting the privacy constraints, for all queries in a general\nquery class. Specifically, a differentially private mechanism is constructed to\n\"encode\" rich stochastic structure into the synthetic database, and\n\"customized\" companion estimators are then derived to provide accurate answers\nby making use of all available information, including the mechanism (which is\npublic information) and the query functions. Accordingly, the distortion under\nthe best of this kind of mechanisms at the worst-case query in a general query\nclass, so called the minimax distortion, provides a fundamental\ncharacterization of differentially private query release.\n  For the general class of statistical queries, we prove that with the\nsquared-error distortion measure, the minimax distortion is $O(1/n)$ by\nderiving asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds in the regime that the\ndatabase size $n$ goes to infinity. The upper bound is achievable by a\nmechanism $\\mathcal{E}$ and its corresponding companion estimators, which\npoints directly to the feasibility of the proposed approach in large databases.\nWe further evaluate the mechanism $\\mathcal{E}$ and the companion estimators\nthrough experiments on real datasets from Netflix and Facebook. Experimental\nresults show improvement over the state-of-art MWEM algorithm and verify the\nscaling behavior $O(1/n)$ of the minimax distortion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2014 06:54:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 07:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

One method, inspired by the locomotion of flagellated bacteria,\nconsists of applying a rotating magnetic field to a rigid, helically-shaped,\npropeller attached to a magnetic head. When the resulting device, termed an\nartificial bacteria flagellum, is aligned perpendicularly to the applied field,\nthe helix rotates and the swimmer moves forward. Experimental investigation of\nartificial bacteria flagella shows that at low frequency of the applied field,\nthe axis of the helix does not align perpendicularly to the field but wobbles\naround the helix, with an angle increasing as the inverse of the field\nfrequency. By numerical computations and asymptotic analysis, we provide a\ntheoretical explanation for this wobbling behavior.

The second algorithm is a\nrandomized algorithm that enumerates all instances in\n$O\\left(E^{k/2}/\\left(BM^{k/2-1}\\right)\\right)$ expected I/Os; the same bound\nalso applies with high probability under some assumptions. A lower bound shows\nthat the deterministic algorithm is optimal for some pattern graphs with\n$s=k/2$ (e.g., paths and cycles of even length, meshes of even side), while the\nrandomized algorithm is optimal for a wide class of pattern graphs, called Alon\nclass (e.g., cliques, cycles and every graph with a perfect matching).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2014 12:01:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jul 2014 11:43:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2015 10:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-13"}

The mechanism allocates to each user a\nfraction of the resource that is proportional to her bid and collects an amount\nequal to her bid as payment. Since users act as utility-maximizers, this\nnaturally defines a proportional allocation game. Recently, Syrgkanis and\nTardos (STOC 2013) quantified the inefficiency of equilibria in this game with\nrespect to the social welfare and presented a lower bound of 26.8% on the price\nof anarchy over coarse-correlated and Bayes-Nash equilibria in the full and\nincomplete information settings, respectively. In this paper, we improve this\nbound to 50% over both equilibrium concepts. Our analysis is simpler and,\nfurthermore, we argue that it cannot be improved by arguments that do not take\nthe equilibrium structure into account.

This work paves the way to the full physical understanding of\nthe filamentation mechanism and could lead to unexplored phenomena, such as\ncoherent control of the filamentation by harmonic seeding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2014 14:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We analyze the data structures\nbuilt from our proposed model and demonstrate that, for most practical cases,\nthe asymptotic memory complexity of our model is in the order of the\ncardinality of the set of edges. Further, we show that our proposal is an\nunifying model that can represent several previous (classes of) models for\ndynamic networks found in the recent literature, which in general are unable to\nrepresent each other. In contrast to previous models, our proposal is also able\nto intrinsically model cyclic (i.e. periodic) behavior in dynamic networks.\nThese representation capabilities attest the expressive power of our proposed\nunifying model for TVGs.

Compared to the\ncorresponding numerical routines, we have identified three main difficulties\nspecific to linear algebra over finite fields. First, the arithmetic complexity\ncould be dominated by modular reductions. Therefore, it is mandatory to delay\nas much as possible these reductions while mixing fine-grain parallelizations\nof tiled iterative and recursive algorithms. Second, fast linear algebra\nvariants, e.g., using Strassen-Winograd algorithm, never suffer from\ninstability and can thus be widely used in cascade with the classical\nalgorithms. There, trade-offs are to be made between size of blocks well suited\nto those fast variants or to load and communication balancing. Third, many\napplications over finite fields require the rank profile of the matrix (quite\noften rank deficient) rather than the solution to a linear system. It is thus\nimportant to design parallel algorithms that preserve and compute this rank\nprofile. Moreover, as the rank profile is only discovered during the algorithm,\nblock size has then to be dynamic. We propose and compare several block\ndecomposition: tile iterative with left-looking, right-looking and Crout\nvariants, slab and tile recursive. Experiments demonstrate that the tile\nrecursive variant performs better and matches the performance of reference\nnumerical software when no rank deficiency occur. Furthermore, even in the most\nheterogeneous case, namely when all pivot blocks are rank deficient, we show\nthat it is possbile to maintain a high efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2014 15:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-17"}

We find inhomogeneous states\n(IS) where the density profile is spatially non-uniform but constant in time.\nThe states are exact solutions of non-linear partial differential equations\nthat describe the coupled distributions of density and temperature when\ninelastic losses of energy per collision are small. The derivation is performed\nwithout modelling the equations' coefficients that are unknown in the dense\nlimit (such as the equation of state), using only their scaling form specific\nfor hard spheres. The IS is exact non-linear state of this many-body system. It\ncaptures a fundamental property of inelastic collections of particles: the\npossibility of preserving non-uniform temperature via the interplay of\ninelastic cooling and heat conduction, generalizing previous results in the\ndilute case. We perform numerical simulations to demonstrate that arbitrary\ninitial state evolves to the IS in the limit of long times where the container\nhas the geometry of the channel. The evolution is like gas-liquid transition.\nThe liquid condenses in a vanishing part of the total volume but takes most of\nthe mass of the system. However, the gaseous phase, which mass grows only\nlogarithmically with the system size, is relevant because its fast particles\ncarry most of the energy of the system. Remarkably, the system self-organizes\nto dissipate no energy: the inelastic decay of energy is a power-law\n$[1+t/t_c]^{-2}$ where $t_c$ diverges in the thermodynamic limit. This behavior\nis caused by unusual spatial distribution of particles: on approach to one of\nthe container's walls the density grows inversely with the distance. We discuss\nthe relation of our results to the recently proposed finite-time singularity in\nother container's geometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 22:45:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-19"}

In the method, the analysis prototype filter design\nis framed as a convex optimization problem that maximizes the signal-to-alias\nratio (SAR) in the analysis banks. Since each sub-band has a different\nbandwidth, the contribution to the overall SAR from each analysis bank is taken\ninto account during optimization. To increase the degrees of freedom during\noptimization, no constraints are imposed on the phase or group delay of the\nfilters; at the same time, low delay is achieved by ensuring that the resulting\nfilters are minimum phase. Experimental results show that the filter bank\ndesigned using the proposed method results in a sub-band adaptive filter with a\nmuch better echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) when compared with existing\ndesign methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2014 03:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-19"}

Since the linear line element is an operator, we treat\nit according to the rules of quantum mechanics and interpret its eigenvalues as\nphysically observable distances; the distance eigenvalues are naturally\nquantized. There are both positive and negative eigenvalues, which requires\ninterpretation. Multi-element curves are defined as direct sums of line\nelements, and behave much like systems of spin half electrons in a magnetic\nfield. For a curve of many elements an entropy and energy and temperature are\nquite naturally defined, leading via standard statistical thermodynamics to a\nrelation between the most probable curve length and temperature. That relation\nmay be viewed as a universal heat-shrinking property of curves. At this stage\nof the theory we do not include bodies or particles in the mix, do not suggest\nfield equations for the quantum geometry, and questions of interpretation\nremain. The theory might conceivably be testable using observations of the\nearly Universe, when the temperature of space was presumably quite high.
