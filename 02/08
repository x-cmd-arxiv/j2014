The question is relevant to\nmany fields such as, for example, array processing, radar, wireless\ncommunications, data compression, dimensionality reduction, and biomedical\nengineering. The desired property of having the same beampattern for different\ncolumns of a beamspace transformation matrix (beamforming vectors) often plays\na key importance in practical applications. The result is that at most\n2^{M-1}-1 beamforming vectors with the same beampattern can be generated from\nany given beamforming vector. Here M is the dimension of the beamforming\nvector. At the constructive side, the answer to this question allows for\ncomputationally efficient techniques for the beamspace transformation design.\nIndeed, one can start with a single beamforming vector, which gives a desired\nbeampattern, and generate a number of other beamforming vectors, which give\nabsolutely the same beampattern, in a computationally efficient way. We call\nthe initial beamforming vector as the mother beamforming vector. One possible\nprocedure for generating all possible new beamforming vectors with the same\nbeampattern from the mother beamforming vector is proposed. The application of\nthe proposed analysis to the transmit beamspace design in multiple-input\nmultiple-output radar is also given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 16:24:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-03"}

We discovered that the ages of six of\nour clusters have been appreciably underestimated by previous studies, which\nused comparatively small telescopes, graphically illustrating the need for\nlarge apertures to obtain reliable ages of old and intermediate-age SMC star\nclusters. In particular, three of these clusters, L4, L6 and L110, turn out to\nbe amongst the oldest SMC clusters known, with ages of 7.9 +- 1.1, 8.7 +- 1.2\nand 7.6 +- 1.0 Gyr, respectively, helping to fill a possible \"SMC cluster age\ngap\" (Glatt et al. 2008). Using the present ages and metallicities from Parisi\net al. (2009), we analyze the age distribution, age gradient and age\nmetallicity relation (AMR) of a sample of SMC clusters measured homogeneously.\nThere is a suggestion of bimodality in the age distribution but it does not\nshow a constant slope for the first 4 Gyr (Piatti 2011), and we find no\nevidence for an age gradient. Due to the improved ages of our cluster sample,\nwe find that our AMR is now better represented in the intermediate/old period\nthan that we derived in Parisi et al.

Additionally, clusters younger than aprox. 4 Gyr\nnow show better agreement with the bursting model, but we confirm that this\nmodel is not a good representation of the AMR during the intermediate-age/old\nperiod.

This\nmodel is based on the numerical solution of the local mass, energy and momentum\nbalances of the gas and solid species by the finite volume method. A single\npellet sub-model was included in the global furnace model to simulate the\nsuccessive reactions (hematite->magnetite ->wustite->iron) involved in the\nprocess, using the concept of additive reaction times. The different steps of\nmass transfer and possible iron sintering at the grain scale were accounted\nfor. The kinetic parameters were derived from reduction experiments carried out\nin a thermobalance furnace, at different conditions, using small hematite cubes\nshaped from industrial pellets. Solid characterizations were also performed to\nfurther understand the microstrutural evolution. First results have shown that\nthe use of hydrogen accelerates the reduction in comparison to CO reaction,\nmaking it possible to design a hydrogen-operated shaft reactor quite smaller\nthan current MIDREX and HYL. Globally, the hydrogen steelmaking route based on\nthis new process is technically and environmentally attractive. CO2 emissions\nwould be reduced by more than 80%. Its future is linked to the emergence of the\nhydrogen economy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 17:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-10"}

Present collider bounds suggest that the\ncharacteristic values of these parameters may be significantly larger than the\nweak scale. Large values of the soft breaking parameters, however, induce large\nradiative corrections to the Higgs mass parameter and therefore the proper\nelectroweak scale may only be obtained by a fine tuned cancellation between the\nsquare of the holomorphic \\mu-parameter and the Higgs supersymmetry breaking\nsquare mass parameter. This can only be avoided if there is a correlation\nbetween the scalar and gaugino mass parameters, such that the Higgs\nsupersymmetry breaking parameter remains of the order of the weak scale. The\nscale at which this happens is dubbed as focus point. In this article, we\ndefine the general conditions required for this to happen, for different values\nof the messenger scale at which supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the\nobservable sector, and for arbitrary boundary conditions of the sfermion,\ngaugino, and Higgs mass parameters.

Unfortunately, the exact number of individuals of\neach class may be unknown: consumers do not always report the appropriate\nclass, due to various factors including differential energy rates for different\nconsumer classes.

Complete knowledge of function\nwould aid in the prioritization of loci when searching for the genetic bases of\ndisease or adaptive phenotypes. Because mutations that disrupt function are\ndisfavored by natural selection, purifying selection leaves a detectable\nsignature within functional elements; accordingly this signal has been\nexploited through the use of genomic comparisons of distantly related species.\nHowever, the functional complement of the genome changes extensively across\ntime and between lineages, therefore, evidence of the current action of\npurifying selection is essential. Because the removal of deleterious mutations\nby natural selection also reduces within-species genetic diversity within\nfunctional loci, dense population genetic data have the potential to reveal\ngenomic elements that are currently functional. Here we assess the potential of\nthis approach using 16,411 human mitochondrial genomes. We show that the high\ndensity of polymorphism in this dataset precisely delineates regions\nexperiencing purifying selection. Further, we show that the number of\nsegregating alleles at a site is strongly correlated with its divergence across\nspecies after accounting for known mutational biases in human mtDNA. These two\nmeasures track one another at a remarkably fine scale across many loci--a\ncorrelation that is purely the result of natural selection. Our results\ndemonstrate that genetic variation has the potential to reveal exactly which\nnucleotides in the genome are currently performing important functions and\nlikely to have deleterious fitness effects when mutated.

Currently, the most effective method\nto measure the proteome is with shotgun, or bottom-up, proteomics, in which the\nproteome is digested into peptides that are identified followed by protein\ninference. Despite continuous improvements to all steps of the shotgun\nproteomics workflow, observed proteome coverage is often low; some proteins are\nidentified by a single peptide sequence. Complete proteome sequence coverage\nwould allow comprehensive characterization of RNA splicing variants and all\npost translational modifications, which would drastically improve the accuracy\nof biological models. There are many reasons for the sequence coverage deficit,\nbut ultimately peptide length determines sequence observability. Peptides that\nare too short are lost because they match many protein sequences and their true\norigin is ambiguous. The maximum observable peptide length is determined by\nseveral analytical challenges. This paper explores computationally how peptide\nlengths produced from several common proteome digestion methods limit\nobservable proteome coverage. Iterative proteome cleavage strategies are also\nexplored. These simulations reveal that maximized proteome coverage can be\nachieved by use of an iterative digestion protocol involving multiple proteases\nand chemical cleavages that theoretically allow 91.1% proteome coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 23:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-30"}

In a flat space, such energy growth is due to an inverse\ncascade, which builds a constant part of the velocity autocorrelation function\nproportional to time and expanding in scales, while the moments of the velocity\ndifference saturate during a time depending on the distance. For the curved\nspace, we analyze the long-time long-distance scaling limit, that lives in a\ndegenerate conical geometry, and find that the energy-containing mode linearly\ngrowing with time is not constant in space.

The energy current across scales does not increase linearly\nwith the scale, as in a flat space, but reaches a maximum around the curvature\nradius.

The\ncomputations of these space-filling functions and their inverse functions are\nabsolutely convergent geometric series.\n  The space-filling functions are constructed as limits of integer recurrences\nand equivalently as non-terminating real recurrences. Scaling relations are\ngiven which enable the space-filling functions and curves and their inverses to\nextend beyond the unit area or volume and even to all of $d$-space.\n  This unification of pandimensional space-filling curves facilitates\nquantitative comparison of curves generated from different Hamiltonian paths.\nThe isotropy and performance in dimension reduction of a variety of\nspace-filling curves are analyzed.\n  For dimension reduction it is found that Hilbert curves perform somewhat\nbetter than Peano curves and their isotropic variants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2014 01:01:46 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 03:36:20 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 01:09:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Feb 2014 01:02:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 02:50:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 01:20:28 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 4 Apr 2014 23:46:04 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 00:38:57 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 12 Jul 2014 01:37:16 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 00:20:26 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 21:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

For this network, we examine the 3-phase hierarchical\ncooperation (HC) scheme and the 2-phase improved HC scheme based on the concept\nof {\\em network multiple access}. Exploiting recent results on the optimality\nof treating interference as noise in Gaussian interference channels, we\noptimize the achievable average per-link rate and not just its scaling law. In\naddition, we provide further improvements on both the previously proposed\nhierarchical cooperation schemes by a more efficient use of TDMA and spatial\nreuse. Thanks to our explicit achievable rate expressions, we can compare HC\nscheme with multihop routing (MR), where the latter can be regarded as the\ncurrent practice of D2D wireless networks. Our results show that the improved\nand optimized HC schemes yield very significant rate gains over MR in realistic\nconditions of channel propagation exponents, signal to noise ratio, and number\nof users. This sheds light on the long-standing question about the real\nadvantage of HC scheme over MR beyond the well-known scaling laws analysis. In\ncontrast, we also show that our rate optimization is non-trivial, since when HC\nis applied with off-the-shelf choice of the system parameters, no significant\nrate gain with respect to MR is achieved. We also show that for large pathloss\nexponent the sum rate is a nearly linear function of the number of users $n$ in\nthe range of networks of practical size. This also sheds light on a\nlong-standing dispute on the effective achievability of linear sum rate scaling\nwith HC. Finally, we notice that the achievable sum rate for large $\\alpha$ is\nmuch larger than for small $\\alpha$. This suggests that HC scheme may be a very\neffective approach for networks operating at mm-waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2014 03:35:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2015 14:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-22"}

The considered action consists of the usual\nEinstein-Hilbert action plus all the terms quadratic in the curvature that\nreduce to the usual Gauss-Bonnet term for vanishing Weyl connection, i.e., when\nonly the Levi-Civita part of the connection is present. We expand the action in\nterms of Riemannian quantities and obtain vector-tensor theories. We find that\nall the free parameters only appear in the kinetic term of the vector field so\nthat two branches are possible: one with a propagating vector field and another\none where the vector field does not propagate. We focus on the propagating\ncase. We find that in 4 dimensions, the theory is equivalent to Einstein's\ngravity plus a Proca field. This field is naturally decoupled from matter so\nthat it represents a natural candidate for dark matter. Also in d=4, we discuss\na non-trivial cubic term in the curvature that can be constructed without\nspoiling the second order nature of the field equations because it leads to the\nvector-tensor Horndeski interaction. In arbitrary dimensions, the theory\nbecomes more involved. We show that, even though the vector field presents\nkinetic interactions which do not have U(1) symmetry, there are no additional\npropagating degrees of freedom with respect to the usual massive case.\nInterestingly, we show that this relies on the fact that the corresponding\nStueckelberg field belongs to a specific class within the general Horndeski\ntheories. Finally, since Weyl geometries are the natural ground to build scale\ninvariant theories, we apply the usual Weyl-gauging in order to make the\nHorndeski action locally scale invariant and discuss on new terms that can be\nadded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2014 12:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

These outflows also represent a natural form of feedback\nbetween the central supermassive black hole and its host galaxy. The mechanism\nfor driving this mass loss remains unknown, although radiation pressure\nmediated by spectral lines is a leading candidate. Here, we calculate the\nionization state of, and emergent spectra for, the hydrodynamic simulation of a\nline-driven disk wind previously presented by Proga & Kallman (2004). To\nachieve this, we carry out a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation of the\nradiative transfer through, and energy exchange within, the predicted outflow.\nWe find that the wind is much more ionized than originally estimated. This is\nin part because it is much more difficult to shield any wind regions\neffectively when the outflow itself is allowed to reprocess and redirect\nionizing photons. As a result, the calculated spectrum that would be observed\nfrom this particular outflow solution would not contain the ultraviolet\nspectral lines that are observed in many AGN/QSOs. Furthermore, the wind is so\nhighly ionized that line-driving would not actually be efficient. This does not\nnecessarily mean that line-driven winds are not viable. However, our work does\nillustrate that in order to arrive at a self-consistent model of line-driven\ndisk winds in AGN/QSO, it will be critical to include a more detailed treatment\nof radiative transfer and ionization in the next generation of hydrodynamic\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2014 12:31:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Feb 2014 13:48:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 May 2014 08:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Within a broad range of parameters, the motor-driven collapse of active\nelastic networks leads to a critical state. We show that this state is\nqualitatively different from that of the random percolation model.\nIntriguingly, it possesses both euclidean and scale-free structure with Fisher\nexponent smaller than $2$. Remarkably, an indistinguishable Fisher exponent and\nthe same euclidean structure is obtained at the critical point of the random\npercolation model after absorbing all enclaves into their surrounding clusters.\nWe propose that in the experiment the enclaves are absorbed due to steric\ninteractions of network elements. We model the network collapse, taking into\naccount the steric interactions. The model shows how the system robustly drives\nitself towards the critical point of the random percolation model with absorbed\nenclaves, in agreement with the experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 21:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-10"}

Our model applies to Raman transitions in three-level atoms with one\nbranch of the transition controlled by a driving pulse, and the other coupled\nto the cavity. For any couplings of input field to the optical cavity and\ndetunings of the atom from the driving pulse and cavity, we extend the\ninput-output relation from Markovian dynamics to non-Markovian one. For most\npossible photon shapes, we derive an analytic expression for the driving pulse\nin order to completely map the input photon into the atom. We find that, the\namplitude of the driving pulse depends only on the detuning of the atom from\nthe frequency of the cavity, i.e., the detuning of the atom to the driving\npulse has no effect on the strength of the driving pulse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Feb 2014 03:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-12"}

As in previous simulations, following the partial emergence of\nthe sub-surface flux into the corona, a combination of vortical motions and\ninternal magnetic reconnection forms a coronal flux rope. Then, in the\nsimulations presented here, external reconnection between the emerging field\nand the pre-existing dipole coronal field allows further expansion of the\ncoronal flux rope into the corona. After sufficient expansion, internal\nreconnection occurs beneath the coronal flux rope axis, and the flux rope\nerupts up to the top boundary of the simulation domain ($\\sim$ 36 Mm above the\nsurface). We find that the presence of a pre-existing field, orientated in a\ndirection to facilitate reconnection with the emerging field, is vital to the\nfast rise of the coronal flux rope. The simulations shown in this paper are\nable to self-consistently create many of the surface and coronal signatures\nused by coronal mass ejection (CME) models. These signatures include: surface\nshearing and rotational motions; quadrupolar geometry above the surface;\ncentral sheared arcades reconnecting with oppositely orientated overlying\ndipole fields; the formation of coronal flux ropes underlying potential coronal\nfield; and internal reconnection which resembles the classical flare\nreconnection scenario. This suggests that proposed mechanisms for the\ninitiation of a CME, such as \"magnetic breakout\", are operating during the\nemergence of new active regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Feb 2014 19:15:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 17:49:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}
