The\nterms in the sum rule series, however, are weighted by the state energies, so\nconvergence of the series requires that the position matrix elements scale at\nmost in inverse proportion to the square root of the energy.

First we show that the latter\nderivations had normalization factors that are twice and quadriple the correct\nones respectively. This means that $S_2$ contributes not 72% as was previously\nthought but 36% to the total DSF. We also calculated the contribution of $S_4$\nto be between 18% and 20% and not 27% as was calculated by Caux and Hagemans.\nIn fact we show that the latter reference had also the normalization factor\ntwice the correct value and had it done the numeric integrations correctly it\nwould have obtained a contribution between 36% and 40% for $S_4$. Furthermore,\nwe prove that its claim that our initial derivation of $S_4$ was also incorrect\nin its dependency on the spectral parameters is incorrect because fixing the\nmomentun transfer $k$ up to $2\\pi$ as the latter reference did to justify its\nclaim only amounts to mutltiplying the overall factor by 2 because as we will\nprove in this paper $S_4$ is periodic in $k$ with period $2\\pi$. Also in this\npaper we derive $S_n$ for general $n$ by following a different approach\ncompared to our initial derivation of $S_4$. Although for $S_4$ both the new\nderivation and the initial one lead to equivalent formulas that are expressed\ndifferently, the new form presented in this paper is much more elegant and\ncompact and also reveals new hidden and nontrivial symmetries which\nsubstantially simplify the numeric evaluation of $S_4$ and its sum rules.\nMoreover based on the results of this paper we propose a simple approximation\nto the total DSF of the Heisenberg model. Finally we comment on how our work\nmight resolve the discrepancy between the exact theoretic results and\nexperiemntal data as reported by Zaliznyak et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2014 23:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-18"}

They could be formed in orbits with a small inclination (with respect\nto the stellar spin) via disk migration, or in more highly inclined orbits via\nhigh-eccentricity migration, where gravitational interactions with a companion\nand tidal dissipation are at play. Here we target hot Jupiter systems where the\nmisalignment $\\lambda$ has been inferred observationally and we investigate\nwhether their properties are consistent with high-eccentricity migration.\nSpecifically, we study whether stellar tides can be responsible for the\nobserved distribution of $\\lambda$ and orbital separations. Improving on\nprevious studies, we use detailed models for each star, thus accounting for how\nconvection (and tidal dissipation) depends on stellar properties. In line with\nobservations suggesting that hotter stars have higher $\\lambda$, we find that\n$\\lambda$ increases as the amount of stellar surface convection decreases.

The objective of this work is to validate the feasibility of the\npredictor built with a simplified metric set for software defect prediction in\ndifferent scenarios, and to investigate practical guidelines for the choice of\ntraining data, classifier and metric subset of a given project. First, based on\nsix typical classifiers, we constructed three types of predictors using the\nsize of software metric set in three scenarios. Then, we validated the\nacceptable performance of the predictor based on Top-k metrics in terms of\nstatistical methods. Finally, we attempted to minimize the Top-k metric subset\nby removing redundant metrics, and we tested the stability of such a minimum\nmetric subset with one-way ANOVA tests. The experimental results indicate that\n(1) the choice of training data should depend on the specific requirement of\nprediction accuracy; (2) the predictor built with a simplified metric set works\nwell and is very useful in case limited resources are supplied; (3) simple\nclassifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes) also tend to perform well when using a\nsimplified metric set for defect prediction; and (4) in several cases, the\nminimum metric subset can be identified to facilitate the procedure of general\ndefect prediction with acceptable loss of prediction precision in practice.

Nonetheless, a closer look at the\nprinciples and formal body of this theory shows that, beyond longstanding\nprejudices, there is still room enough for alternative tools. This is the case,\nfor example, of Bohmian mechanics. As it is discussed here, there is nothing\ncontradictory or wrong with this hydrodynamical representation, which enhances\nthe dynamical role of the quantum phase to the detriment (to some extent) of\nthe probability density. The possibility to describe the evolution of quantum\nsystems in terms of trajectories or streamlines is just a direct consequence of\nthe fact that Bohmian mechanics (quantum hydrodynamics) is just a way to recast\nquantum mechanics in the more general language of the theory of\ncharacteristics. Misconceptions concerning Bohmian mechanics typically come\nfrom the fact that many times it is taken out of context and considered as an\nalternative theory to quantum mechanics, which is not the case. On the\ncontrary, an appropriate contextualization shows that Bohmian mechanics\nconstitutes a serious and useful representation of quantum mechanics, at the\nsame level as any other quantum picture, such as Schr\\\"odinger's, Heisenberg's,\nDirac's, or Feynman's, for instance.

As the number of bath degrees of freedom\nincreases and full quantum simulations turn out computationally prohibitive,\nsimpler models become essential to understand and gain an insight into the main\nphysical mechanisms involved in the system dynamics. In this regard,\nvibrational decoherence of an I$_2$ diatomics is tackled here within the\nframework of Markovian quantum state diffusion. The I$_2$ dynamics are analyzed\nin terms of an effective decoherence rate, $\\Lambda$, and the specific choice\nof the initial state, in particular, Gaussian wave packets and two-state\nsuperpositions. It is found that, for Markovian baths, the relevant quantity\nregarding decoherence is the product of friction ($\\eta$) and temperature\n($T$); there is no distinction between varying one or the other. It is also\nobserved that decoherence becomes faster as the energy levels involved in the\nsystem state correspond to higher eigenvalues. This effect is due to a\npopulation redistribution during the dynamical process and an eventual\nirreversible loss of the initial coherence. These results have been compared\nwith those available in the literature from more detailed semiclassical IVR\nsimulations, finding a good agreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 03:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-18"}

However, there is a considerable empirical\ncontroversy on which statistical model fits the citation distributions best.\nThis paper is concerned with rigorous empirical detection of power-law\nbehaviour in the distribution of citations received by the most highly cited\nscientific papers. We have used a large, novel data set on citations to\nscientific papers published between 1998 and 2002 drawn from Scopus. The\npower-law model is compared with a number of alternative models using a\nlikelihood ratio test. We have found that the power-law hypothesis is rejected\nfor around half of the Scopus fields of science. For these fields of science,\nthe Yule, power-law with exponential cut-off and log-normal distributions seem\nto fit the data better than the pure power-law model. On the other hand, when\nthe power-law hypothesis is not rejected, it is usually empirically\nindistinguishable from most of the alternative models. The pure power-law model\nseems to be the best model only for the most highly cited papers in \"Physics\nand Astronomy\". Overall, our results seem to support theories implying that the\nmost highly cited scientific papers follow the Yule, power-law with exponential\ncut-off or log-normal distribution. Our findings suggest also that power laws\nin citation distributions, when present, account only for a very small fraction\nof the published papers (less than 1% for most of science fields) and that the\npower-law scaling parameter (exponent) is substantially higher (from around 3.2\nto around 4.7) than found in the older literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 05:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-18"}

This algorithm considerably outperforms\nthe naive approach where one first computes ${\\cal F}$ from ${\\cal A}$ and\n${\\cal B}$, and then computes the $q$-representative family ${\\cal F}'$ from\n${\\cal F}$.\n  We give two applications of our new algorithms for computing\n$q$-representative sets for product families. The first is a\n$3.8408^{k}n^{O(1)}$ deterministic algorithm for the Multilinear Monomial\nDetection ($k$-MlD) problem. The second is a significant improvement of\ndeterministic dynamic programming algorithms for \"connectivity problems\" on\ngraphs of bounded treewidth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 06:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-18"}

This suggests confinement. Recent\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, which explored the transport of\npre-accelerated hot electrons through ambient cold plasma, showed that the\nformation of a highly localized electrostatic potential drop, in the form of a\ndouble layer (DL), significantly inhibited the transport of hot electrons (T.C.\nLi, J.F.

In this work, we investigate the scaling of the DL strength\nwith the hot electron temperature by PIC simulations, and find a linear\nscaling. We demonstrate that the strength is limited by the formation of\nparallel shocks. Based on this, we analytically determine the maximum DL\nstrength, and find also a linear scaling with the hot electron temperature. The\nDL strength obtained from the analytic calculation is comparable to that from\nthe simulations. At the maximum strength, the DL is capable of confining a\nsignificant fraction of hot electrons in the source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 07:32:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-18"}

Both of these\neffects have a common cause which is the distortion of the spectrum due to the\ncoupling with the background field. Choosing the potential to be a symmetrical\nsquare-well, the problem becomes exactly solvable and we can find the whole\nspectrum of the system, analytically. We show that the total number of states\nand the total density remain unchanged as compared with the free case, as one\nexpects. Furthermore, since the positive- and negative-energy eigenstates of\nthe fermion are fermion-number conjugates of each other and there is no\nzero-energy bound state, the total density and the total number of negative and\npositive states remain unchanged, separately. Therefore, the vacuum\npolarization in this model is zero for any choice of the parameters of the\npotential. It is important to note that although the vacuum polarization is\nzero due to the symmetries of the model, the Casimir energy of the system is\nnot zero in general. In the graph of the Casimir energy as a function of the\ndepth of the well there is a maximum approximately when the bound energy levels\nchange direction and move back towards their continuum of origin. The Casimir\nenergy for a fixed value of the depth is a linear function of the width and is\nalways positive. Moreover, the Casimir energy density (the energy density of\nall the negative-energy states) and the energy density of all the\npositive-energy states are exactly the mirror images of each other. Finally,\ncomputing the total energy of a valence fermion present in the lowest fermionic\nbound state, taking into account the Casimir energy, we find that the lowest\nbound state is almost always unstable for the scalar potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 08:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Early methods mainly fall into two paradigms with certain\nbenefits and drawbacks: (1)Greedy algorithms, selecting seed nodes one by one,\ngive a guaranteed accuracy relying on the accurate approximation of influence\nspread with high computational cost; (2)Heuristic algorithms, estimating\ninfluence spread using efficient heuristics, have low computational cost but\nunstable accuracy.\n  We first point out that greedy algorithms are essentially finding a\nself-consistent ranking, where nodes' ranks are consistent with their\nranking-based marginal influence spread. This insight motivates us to develop\nan iterative ranking framework, i.e., IMRank, to efficiently solve influence\nmaximization problem under independent cascade model. Starting from an initial\nranking, e.g., one obtained from efficient heuristic algorithm, IMRank finds a\nself-consistent ranking by reordering nodes iteratively in terms of their\nranking-based marginal influence spread computed according to current ranking.\nWe also prove that IMRank definitely converges to a self-consistent ranking\nstarting from any initial ranking. Furthermore, within this framework, a\nlast-to-first allocating strategy and a generalization of this strategy are\nproposed to improve the efficiency of estimating ranking-based marginal\ninfluence spread for a given ranking. In this way, IMRank achieves both\nremarkable efficiency and high accuracy by leveraging simultaneously the\nbenefits of greedy algorithms and heuristic algorithms. As demonstrated by\nextensive experiments on large scale real-world social networks, IMRank always\nachieves high accuracy comparable to greedy algorithms, with computational cost\nreduced dramatically, even about $10-100$ times faster than other scalable\nheuristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 09:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-18"}

The work consists of\nthree main parts, in which I review (i) theoretical models and what they\npredict for experimentally accessible properties in the two-band and other\nscenarios, (ii) experimental methods applied for investigating superconducting\nproperties and the results obtained in potential two-band materials, and (iii)\nmaterials, for which two- or multi-band superconductivity has been suggested.\nIt is shown that two-band effects appear in most of the analyzed properties and\nthat they can be quite significant but usually fade away as interband\ninteractions increase. Anisotropy often leads to similar modifications in\nsingle-band superconductors, which is why the distinction of two-band and\nanisotropy effects is usually difficult, particularly when the temperature\ndependence of the quantities is examined. In contrast, the field dependent\neffects are more often different and thus more often allow a reliable\ndistinction between the models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 10:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-18"}

After the successful IPv6 test on 8 June, 2011 (World IPv6 Day [1]),\nnetwork operators and service/content providers were brought together for\npreparing the next step of the IPv6 global deployment (World IPv6 Launch on 6\nJune, 2012 [2]). The main purpose of the event was to permanently enable their\nIPv6 connectivity. In this paper, based on the Internet traffic collected from\na large European Internet Exchange Point (IXP), we present the status of IPv6\ntraffic mainly focusing on the periods of the two global IPv6 events. Our\nresults show that IPv6 traffic is responsible for a small fraction such as 0.5\n% of the total traffic in the peak period. Nevertheless, we are positively\nimpressed by the facts that the increase of IPv6 traffic/prefixes shows a steep\nincrease and that the application mix of IPv6 traffic starts to imitate the one\nof IPv4-dominated Internet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 12:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-18"}

The physical scenario is that of a conical,\nmagnetized plasma jet having a periodical (P1) increase of relativistic\nparticles, Nrel, at a specific orbital phase, as predicted by accretion in the\neccentric orbit of LSI+61303. Jet precession (P2) changes the angle, eta,\nbetween jet axis and line of sight, thereby inducing variable Doppler boosting.\nThe problem is defined in spherical geometry, and the optical depth through the\nprecessing jet is calculated by taking into account that the plasma is\nstratified along the jet axis. The synchrotron emission of such a jet was\ncalculated and we fitted the resulting flux density Smodel(t) to the observed\nflux density obtained during a 6.5-year monitoring of LSI+61303 by the Green\nBank radio interferometer. Our physical model for the system LSI+61303 is not\nonly able to reproduce the long-term modulation in the radio emission, but it\nalso reproduces all the other observed characteristics of the radio source, the\norbital modulation of the outbursts, their orbital phase shift, and their\nspectral index properties. Moreover, a correspondence seems to exist between\nvariations in the ejection angle induced by precession and the rapid rotation\nin position angle observed in VLBA images. We conclude that the peak of the\nlong-term modulation occurs when the jet electron density is around its maximum\nand the approaching jet is forming the smallest possible angle with the line of\nsight. This coincidence of maximum number of emitting particles and maximum\nDoppler boosting of their emission occurs every 1667 days and creates the\nlong-term modulation observed in LSI+61303.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 12:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-18"}

This problem has been considered previously in the\nliterature, with some disagreement about whether or not a train of waves exist\non the free surface for Froude numbers less than unity. The physical\nassumptions behind the accepted model are clearly stated and governing\nequations and boundary conditions derived. Complex variable theory is then\nemployed to obtain a singular nonlinear integral equation, which describes the\nflow field completely.\n  The integral equation is evaluated numerically using a collocation method,\nand implemented with mathematical software {\\em Matlab}. The numerical\nsolutions suggest that indeed waves do exist on the free surface, but are\nexponentially small in the limit that the Froude number approaches zero. An\nasymptotic expression is also derived to solve the integral equation, valid for\nsmall Froude numbers. This expansion is calculated to second order, which\nimproves on the leading order solution given previously in the literature. Such\na scheme is unable to predict waves on the free surface, since they are\nexponentially small. It is discussed how exponential asymptotics could be used\nto derive a more accurate analytic solution that describes waves on the free\nsurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 13:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-18"}

With Herschel, we have now observed 17 GRBHs up to\nredshift z~3 and detected seven of them at infrared (IR) wavelengths. This\nrelatively high detection rate (41%) may be due to the composition of our\nsample which at a median redshift of 1.1 is dominated by the hosts of dark\nGRBs. Although the numbers are small, statistics suggest that dark GRBs are\nmore likely to be detected in the IR than their optically-bright counterparts.\nCombining our IR data with optical, near-infrared, and radio data from our own\ndatasets and from the literature, we have constructed spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) which span up to 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. By\nfitting the SEDs, we have obtained stellar masses, dust masses, star-formation\nrate (SFR), and extinctions for our sample galaxies. We find that GRBHs are\ngalaxies that tend to have a high specfic SFR (sSFR), and like other\nstar-forming galaxies, their ratios of dust-to-stellar mass are well correlated\nwith sSFR. We incorporate our Herschel sample into a larger compilation of\nGRBHs, and compare this combined sample to SFR-weighted median stellar masses\nof the widest, deepest galaxy survey to date. This is done in order to\nestablish whether or not GRBs can be used as an unbiased tracer of cosmic\ncomoving SFR density (SFRD) in the universe. In contrast with previous results,\nthis comparison shows that GRBHs are medium-sized galaxies with relatively high\nsSFRs; stellar masses and sSFRs of GRBHs as a function of redshift are similar\nto what is expected for star-forming galaxy populations at similar redshifts.\nWe conclude that there is no strong evidence that GRBs are biased tracers of\nSFRD; thus they should be able to reliably probe the SFRD to early epochs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 14:07:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 10:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

First, we find that the empirical fractal\ndimensions of these networks obtained by our program coincide with the\ntheoretical formula given by Song {\\it et al.} ( {\\it Nat. Phys}, 2006, {\\bf\n2}: 275). Then from the shape of the $\\tau(q)$ and $D(q)$ curves, we find the\nexistence of multifractality in these networks. Last, we find that there exists\na linear relationship between the average information dimension $<D(1)>$ and\nthe parameter $e$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 14:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The first epoch spectrum shows\nthat the ISM in the GRB host galaxy at z = 2.8145 is extremely rich in\nabsorption features, with three components contributing to the line profiles.\nThe hydrogen column density associated with GRB 120327A has log NH / cm^(-2) =\n22.01 +/- 0.09, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the range [X/H] =\n-1.3 to -1.1. In addition to the ground state lines, we detect absorption\nfeatures associated with excited states of CII, OI, SiII, FeII, and NiII, which\nwe used to derive information on the distance between the host absorbing gas\nand the site of the GRB explosion. The variability of the FeI\\lambda2396\nexcited line between the two epochs proves that these features are excited by\nthe GRB UV flux. Moreover, the distance of component I is found to be\ndI=200+100-60 pc, while component II is located closer to the GRB, at\ndII=100+40-30 pc. These values are among the lowest found in GRBs. Component\nIII does not show excited transitions, so it should be located farther away\nfrom the GRB. The presence of H2 molecules is firmly established, with a\nmolecular fraction in the range f=4 X 10^(-7) - 10^(-4). This particularly low\nvalue can be attributed to the small dust content.

We employ a game-theoretic setup to model the\ninteraction between the sensors and the receiver. The cost function of the\nreceiver is equal to the estimation error variance while the cost function of\nthe sensor contains an extra term which is determined by its private\ninformation. We start by the single sensor case in which the receiver has\naccess to a noisy but honest side information in addition to the message\ntransmitted by a strategic sensor. We study both static and dynamic estimation\nproblems. For both these problems, we characterize a family of equilibria in\nwhich the sensor and the receiver employ simple strategies. Interestingly, for\nthe dynamic estimation problem, we find an equilibrium for which the strategic\nsensor uses a memory-less policy. We generalize the static estimation setup to\nmultiple sensors with synchronous communication structure (i.e., all the\nsensors transmit their messages simultaneously).

Most\nprevious approaches predict users' friendship based on their historical\nrecords, such as their existing friendship, social interactions, etc. However,\nin reality, most users have limited friends in a single network, and the data\ncan be very sparse. The sparsity problem causes existing methods to overfit the\nrare observations and suffer from serious performance degradation. This is\nparticularly true when a new social network just starts to form. We observe\nthat many of today's social networks are composite in nature, where people are\noften engaged in multiple networks. In addition, users' friendships are always\ncorrelated, for example, they are both friends on Facebook and Google+. Thus,\nby considering those overlapping users as the bridge, the friendship knowledge\nin other networks can help predict their friendships in the current network.\nThis can be achieved by exploiting the knowledge in different networks in a\ncollective manner. However, as each individual network has its own properties\nthat can be incompatible and inconsistent with other networks, the naive\nmerging of all networks into a single one may not work well. The proposed\nsolution is to extract the common behaviors between different networks via a\nhierarchical Bayesian model. It captures the common knowledge across networks,\nwhile avoiding negative impacts due to network differences. Empirical studies\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach improves the mean average precision of\nfriendship prediction over state-of-the-art baselines on nine real-world social\nnetworking datasets significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 15:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-18"}

Here, we focus on the centering\nmechanism in a membrane independent system of Xenopus cytoplasmic egg extracts.\nUsing live microscopy and single particle tracking, we find that asters move\ntowards chromatinized DNA structures. The velocity and directionality profiles\nsuggest a random walk with drift directed towards DNA. We have developed a\ntheoretical model that can explain this movement as a result of a gradient of\nMT length dynamics and MT gliding on immobilized dynein motors. In simulations,\nthe antagonistic action of the motor species on the radial array of MTs leads\nto a tug-of-war purely due to geometric considerations and aster motility\nresembles a directed random-walk. Additionally our model predicts that aster\nvelocities do not change greatly with varying initial distance from DNA. The\nmovement of asymmetric asters becomes increasingly super-diffusive with\nincreasing motor density, but for symmetric asters it becomes less\nsuper-diffusive. The transition of symmetric asters from superdiffusive to\ndiffusive mobility is the result of number fluctuations in bound motors in the\ntug-of-war.

Particularly, the decoupling effects of top quark affect neutrino mass\neigenvalues, which are important for analyzing predictions such as mass squared\ndifferences and neutrinoless double beta decay in an underlying theory existing\nat high energy scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 13:03:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jul 2014 07:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-18"}

Our analysis is based on the references cited in the Higgs boson\npublications published since 1974. The objective of our analysis consists of\nidentifying concrete individual publications in the Higgs boson research\ncontext to which the scientific community frequently had referred to. As a\nconsequence, we are interested in seminal works which contributed to a high\nextent to the discovery of the Higgs boson. Our results show that researchers\nin the Higgs boson field preferably refer to more recently published papers -\nparticular papers published since the beginning of the sixties. For example,\nour analysis reveals seven major contributions which appeared within the\nsixties: Englert and Brout (1964), Higgs (1964, 2 papers), and Guralnik et al.\n(1964) on the Higgs mechanism as well as Glashow (1961), Weinberg (1967), and\nSalam (1968) on the unification of weak and electromagnetic interaction. Even\nif the Nobel Prize award highlights the outstanding importance of the work of\nPeter Higgs and Francois Englert, bibliometrics offer the additional\npossibility of getting hints to other publications in this research field\n(especially to historical publications), which are of vital importance from the\nexpert point of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 15:34:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 10:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-30"}

The energy transfer\nin the scattering process is encoded in the precession of the polarization\nvector of the scattered photons. Thus, the energy resolution of such a\nspectroscopy is independent of the bandwidth of the probing radiation. The\nmeasured quantity resembles the intermediate scattering function of the\nmagnetic excitations in the sample. At pulsed x-ray sources, especially x-ray\nlasers, the proposed technique allows to take single-shot spectra of the\nmagnetic dynamics.
