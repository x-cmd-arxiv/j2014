Powder x-ray diffraction of the as grown crystal revealed that PrSi\ncrystallizes in FeB$-$type structure with space group $Pnma$ (no. 62). PrSi\nundergoes a ferromagnetic transition at 52 K with [010] direction as the easy\naxis of magnetization. Heat capacity data confirm the bulk nature of the\ntransition at 52 K and exhibit a huge anomaly at the transition. A sharp rise\nin the low temperature heat capacity has been observed (below 5 K) which is\nattributed to the $^{141}$Pr nuclear Schottky heat capacity arising from the\nhyperfine field of the Pr moment. The estimated Pr magnetic moment 2.88\n$\\mu_{\\rm B}$/Pr from the hyperfine splitting is in agreement with the\nsaturation magnetization value obtained from the magnetization data measured at\n2 K. From the crystal electric field (CEF) analysis of the magnetic\nsusceptibility, magnetization and the heat capacity data it is found that the\ndegenerate $J = 4$ Hund's rule derived state of Pr$^{3+}$-ion splits into nine\nsinglets with an overall splitting of 284 K, the first excited singlet state\nseparated by just 9 K from the ground state. The magnetic ordering in PrGe\nappears to be due to the exchange generated admixture of low lying crystal\nfield levels. Magnetocaloric effect (MCE) has been investigated from\nmagnetization data along all the three principal crystallographic directions.\nLarge magnetic entropy change, $-\\Delta S_M = $22.2 J/kg K, and the relative\ncooling power, RCP = $460$ J/kg, characteristic of giant magneto caloric effect\nare achieved near the transition temperature ($T_{\\rm C}$ = 52 K) for $H =$~70\nkOe along $[010]$.

We propose a new line of research in the study of international\nconflict by showing that the multiplex fractionalization of the international\nsystem (which we label Kantian fractionalization) is a powerful predictor of\nthe propensity for violent interstate conflict, a key indicator of the system's\nstability. In so doing, we also demonstrate the first use of multislice\nmodularity for community detection in a multiplex network application. Even\nafter controlling for established system-level conflict indicators, we find\nthat Kantian fractionalization contributes more to model fit for violent\ninterstate conflict than previously established measures. Moreover, evaluating\nthe influence of each of the constituent networks shows that joint democracy\nplays little, if any, role in predicting system stability, thus challenging a\nmajor empirical finding of the international relations literature. Lastly, a\nseries of Granger causal tests shows that the temporal variability of Kantian\nfractionalization is consistent with a causal relationship with the prevalence\nof conflict in the international system. This causal relationship has\nreal-world policy implications as changes in Kantian fractionalization could\nserve as an early warning sign of international instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2014 21:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The manuscript, which appears to have been written in early 1931,\ndemonstrates that Einstein once explored a cosmic model in which the mean\ndensity of matter in an expanding universe is maintained constant by the\ncontinuous formation of matter from empty space. This model is very different\nto previously known Einsteinian models of the cosmos (both static and dynamic)\nbut anticipates the later steady-state cosmology of Hoyle, Bondi and Gold in\nsome ways.

To infer\ncausal effects from randomized experiments, Neyman proposed to test the null\nhypothesis of zero average causal effect (Neyman's null), and Fisher proposed\nto test the null hypothesis of zero individual causal effect (Fisher's null).\nAlthough the subtle difference between Neyman's null and Fisher's null has\ncaused lots of controversies and confusions for both theoretical and practical\nstatisticians, a careful comparison between the two approaches has been lacking\nin the literature for more than eighty years. We fill in this historical gap by\nmaking a theoretical comparison between them and highlighting an intriguing\nparadox that has not been recognized by previous researchers. Logically,\nFisher's null implies Neyman's null. It is therefore surprising that, in actual\ncompletely randomized experiments, rejection of Neyman's null does not imply\nrejection of Fisher's null for many realistic situations, including the case\nwith constant causal effect. Furthermore, we show that this paradox also exists\nin other commonly-used experiments, such as stratified experiments,\nmatched-pair experiments, and factorial experiments. Asymptotic analyses,\nnumerical examples, and real data examples all support this surprising\nphenomenon.

Since the 19th century, this concept is one\nof the cornerstones and in the same time puzzles of statistical mechanics.

These 'emergence'\nlaws, not connected directly with the fundamental laws of the physical reality,\nnor acting 'in addition' to them but acting through them were called by Phil\nAnderson 'More is Different', 'das Maass' by Hegel etc. Even though the\n'emergence laws' act through the intermediary of the fundamental laws that\ngovern the individual elementary agents, it turns out that different systems\napparently governed by very different fundamental laws: gravity, chemistry,\nbiology, economics, social psychology, end up often with similar emergence laws\nand outcomes. In particular the emergence of adaptive collective objects endows\nthe system with a granular structure which in turn causes specific macroscopic\ncycles of intermittent fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2014 07:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The\naqueous alteration is particularly important for unraveling the processes\noccurring during the earliest times of the Solar System history, as it can give\ninformation both on the asteroids thermal evolution and on the localization of\nwater sources in the asteroid belt. We present new spectral observations in the\nvisible region of 80 asteroids belonging to the primitive classes C, G, F, B\nand P. We combine the present observations with the visible spectra of\nasteroids available in the literature for a total of 600 primitive main belt\nasteroids. Our analysis shows that the aqueous alteration sequence starts from\nthe P-type objects, practically unaltered, and increases through the F, B, C,\nand G asteroids. Around 50% of the observed C-type asteroids show absorption\nfeatures in the vis. range due to hydrated silicates, implying that more than\n70% of them will have a 3 $\\mu$m absorption band and thus hydrated minerals on\ntheir surfaces. The process dominates in primitive asteroids located between\n2.3 and 3.1 AU, that is at smaller heliocentric distances than previously\nsuggested. The aqueous alteration process dominates in the 50--240 km sized\nprimitive asteroids, while it is less effective for bodies smaller than 50 km.\nNo correlation is found between the aqueous alteration process and the\nasteroids albedo or orbital elements. Comparing the $\\sim$ 0.7 $\\mu$m band\nparameters of hydrated silicates and CM2 carbonaceous chondrites, we see that\nthe band center of meteorites is at longer wavelengths than that of asteroids.\nThis difference on center positions may be attributed to different minerals\nabundances, and to the fact that CM2 available on Earth might not be\nrepresentative of the whole aqueous altered asteroids population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2014 11:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Their sources are superbubbles driven\nby sequential supernova explosions in star forming regions, which carve out\nlarge holes in the interstellar medium and eject hot, metal enriched gas into\nthe halo and to the galactic neighborhood. We investigate the evolution of\nsuperbubbles in exponentially stratified disks. We present advanced analytical\nmodels for the expansion of such bubbles and calculate their evolution in space\nand time. With these models one can derive the energy input that is needed for\nblow-out of superbubbles into the halo and derive the break-up of the shell,\nsince Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities develop soon after a bubble starts to\naccelerate into the halo. The approximation of Kompaneets is modified in order\nto calculate velocity and acceleration of a bubble analytically. Our new model\ndiffers from earlier ones, because it presents for the first time an analytical\ncalculation for the expansion of superbubbles in an exponential density\ndistribution driven by a time-dependent energy input rate. The time-sequence of\nsupernova explosions of OB-stars is modeled using their main sequence lifetime\nand an initial mass function. We calculate the morphology and kinematics of\nsuperbubbles powered by three different kinds of energy input and we derive the\nenergy input required for blow-out as a function of the density and the scale\nheight of the ambient interstellar medium. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability\ntimescale in the shell is calculated in order to estimate when the shell starts\nto fragment and finally breaks up. Analytical models are a very efficient tool\nfor comparison to observations, like e.g. the Local Bubble and the W4 bubble\ndiscussed in this paper, and also give insight into the dynamics of superbubble\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Feb 2014 13:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-02-04"}

We analyze this scenario and find the underlying assumptions to be\nunlikely. We examine the alternative scenario of what happens when universal\ngoals that are not human-centric are used for designing AI agents. We follow a\ndesign approach that tries to exclude malevolent motivations from AI agents,\nhowever, we see that objectives that seem benevolent may pose significant risk.\nWe consider the following meta-rules: preserve and pervade life and culture,\nmaximize the number of free minds, maximize intelligence, maximize wisdom,\nmaximize energy production, behave like human, seek pleasure, accelerate\nevolution, survive, maximize control, and maximize capital. We also discuss\nvarious solution approaches for benevolent behavior including selfless goals,\nhybrid designs, Darwinism, universal constraints, semi-autonomy, and\ngeneralization of robot laws. A \"prime directive\" for AI may help in\nformulating an encompassing constraint for avoiding malicious behavior. We\nhypothesize that social instincts for autonomous robots may be effective such\nas attachment learning. We mention multiple beneficial scenarios for an\nadvanced semi-autonomous AGI agent in the near future including space\nexploration, automation of industries, state functions, and cities. We conclude\nthat a beneficial AI agent with intelligence beyond human-level is possible and\nhas many practical use cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2014 17:35:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 21:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}
