However,\nseveral aspects of energy transfer and its relation to consistently defining\nposition-dependent ladder operators for the electromagnetic field in\nnonequilibrium conditions have partly escaped the attention. In this work we\ndefine the position-dependent ladder operators and an effective local\nphoton-number operator that are consistent with the canonical commutation\nrelations and use these concepts to describe the energy transfer and thermal\nbalance in layered geometries. This approach results in a position-dependent\nphoton-number concept that is simple and consistent with classical energy\nconservation arguments. The operators are formed by first calculating the\nvector potential operator using Green's function formalism and Langevin noise\nsource operators related to the medium and its temperature, and then defining\nthe corresponding position-dependent annihilation operator that is required to\nsatisfy the canonical commutation relations in arbitrary geometry. Our results\nsuggest that the effective photon number associated with the electric field is\ngenerally position dependent and enables a straightforward method to calculate\nthe energy transfer rate between the field and the local medium. In particular,\nour results predict that the effective photon number in a vacuum cavity formed\nbetween two lossy material layers can oscillate as a function of the position\nsuggesting that also the local field temperature oscillates.

We find unambiguous\nevidence for the nuclear liquid gas transition once the baryon chemical\npotential approaches the baryon mass, and calculate the nuclear equation of\nstate. In particular, we find a negative binding energy per nucleon causing the\ncondensation, whose absolute value decreases exponentially as mesons get\nheavier. For decreasing meson mass, we observe a first order liquid gas\ntransition with an endpoint at some finite temperature, as well as gap between\nthe onset of isospin and baryon condensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 16:53:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Alternately $u^*$ is also obtained by learning\nthe optimal state-action value function $Q^*$ known as the $Q$ value-function.\nHowever, it is difficult to compute the exact values of $J^*$ or $Q^*$ for MDPs\nwith large number of states. Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) methods\naddress this difficulty by computing lower dimensional approximations of\n$J^*$/$Q^*$.

In this paper we study two\ntechnologically important and deeply interconnected effects that arise from\ninterfacial spin-orbit coupling in metallic films. The first is the spin Hall\neffect, whereby a charge current in the plane of the film is partially\nconverted into an orthogonal spin current in the same plane. The second is the\nEdelstein effect, in which a charge current produces an in-plane, transverse\nspin polarization. At variance with strictly two-dimensional Rashba systems, we\nfind that the spin Hall conductivity has a finite value even if spin-orbit\ninteraction with impurities is neglected and \"vertex corrections\" are properly\ntaken into account. Even more remarkably, such finite value becomes \"universal\"\nin a certain configuration. This is a direct consequence of the spatial\ndependence of spin-orbit coupling on the third dimension, perpendicular to the\nfilm plane. The non-vanishing spin Hall conductivity has a profound influence\non the Edelstein effect, which we show to consist of two terms, the first with\nthe standard form valid in a strictly two-dimensional Rashba system, and a\nsecond arising from the presence of the third dimension. Whereas the standard\nterm is proportional to the momentum relaxation time, the new one scales with\nthe spin relaxation time. Our results, although derived in a specific model,\nshould be valid rather generally, whenever a spatially dependent Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling is present and the electron motion is not strictly\ntwo-dimensional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 18:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

Given a finite horizon $[0,T]$ and a low-mode truncation of the\nPDE, a PM provides an approximate parameterization of the uncontrolled high\nmodes by the controlled low ones so that the unexplained high-mode energy is\nreduced, in an $L^2$-sense, when this parameterization is applied. Analytic\nformulas of such PMs are derived by application of the method of pullback\napproximation of the high-modes (Chekroun, Liu, and Wang, 2013,\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.3896v1.pdf). These formulas allow for an effective\nderivation of reduced ODE systems, aimed to model the evolution of the low-mode\ntruncation of the controlled state variable, where the high-mode part is\napproximated by the PM function applied to the low modes. A priori error\nestimates between the resulting PM-based low-dimensional suboptimal controller\n$u_R^\\ast$ and the optimal controller $u^*$ are derived. These estimates\ndemonstrate that the closeness of $u_R^\\ast$ to $u^*$ is mainly conditioned on\ntwo factors: (i) the parameterization defect of a given PM, associated\nrespectively with $u_R^\\ast$ and $u^*$; and (ii) the energy kept in the high\nmodes of the PDE solution either driven by $u_R^\\ast$ or $u^*$ itself. The\npractical performances of such PM-based suboptimal controllers are numerically\nassessed for various optimal control problems associated with a Burgers-type\nequation. The numerical results show that a PM-based reduced system allows for\nthe design of suboptimal controllers with good performances provided that the\nassociated parameterization defects and energy kept in the high modes are small\nenough, in agreement with the rigorous results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 18:30:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 18:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

We present the basic ideas with simplified\ncalculations so that it is readable to both specialists and nonspecialists in\nthis area of research. A brief derivation of the path integral formulation of\nquantum mechanics in its original form using the orthonormal position and\nmomentum basis is reviewed. For spin systems such as single molecule magnets,\nthe formulation of path integral requires the use of non-orthonormal spin\ncoherent state in $(2s+1)$ dimensional Hilbert space, the coordinate\nindependent and the coordinate dependent form of the spin coherent state path\nintegral is derived. These two forms of spin coherent state path integral are\napplied to the tunneling of single molecule magnets through its magnetic\nanisotropy barrier. Most experimental and numerical results are presented. The\nsuppression of tunneling for half-odd integer spin (spin-parity effect) at zero\nmagnetic field is derived from both forms, which shows that this result\n(spin-parity effect) is independent of the coordinate. At nonzero magnetic\nfield we present both the experimental and the theoretical results of the\noscillation of tunneling splitting as a function of the applied magnetic field\napplied along the spin hard anisotropy axis direction. The experimental and the\ntheoretical results of the tunneling in antiferromagnetic exchange coupled\ndimer model are also reviewed. As the spin coherent state path integral\nformalism is a semi-classical method, an alternative exact mapping of a spin\nsystem to a particle in a potential field (effective potential method) is\nderived. This effective potential method allows for the investigation of phase\ntransition of the escape rate in spin systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 18:45:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 18:05:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Oct 2014 19:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-18"}

Since measurements are made over an irregularly\nsampled Fourier plane, synthesising an intensity image from interferometric\nmeasurements requires substantial processing. Furthermore there are distortions\nthat have to be corrected. In this thesis, a new high-performance image\nsynthesis tool (imaging tool) for radio interferometry is developed.\nImplemented in C++ and CUDA, the imaging tool achieves unprecedented\nperformance by means of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The imaging tool is\ndivided into several components, and the back-end handling numerical\ncalculations is generalised in a new framework. A new feature termed\ncompression arbitrarily increases the performance of an already highly\nefficient GPU-based implementation of the w-projection algorithm. Compression\ntakes advantage of the behaviour of oversampled convolution functions and the\nbaseline trajectories. A CPU-based component prepares data for the GPU which is\nmulti-threaded to ensure maximum use of modern multi-core CPUs. Best\nperformance can only be achieved if all hardware components in a system do work\nin parallel. The imaging tool is designed such that disk I/O and work on CPU\nand GPUs is done concurrently. Test cases show that the imaging tool performs\nnearly 100$\\times$ faster than another general CPU-based imaging tool.\nUnfortunately, the tool is limited in use since deconvolution and A-projection\nare not yet supported. It is also limited by GPU memory. Future work will\nimplement deconvolution and A-projection, whilst finding ways of overcoming the\nmemory limitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 18:46:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-18"}

In\nmultimodal image analysis like image fusion systems, color and IR sensors are\nplaced close to each other and capture a same scene simultaneously, but the\nvideos are not properly aligned by default because of different fields of view,\nimage capturing information, working principle and other camera specifications.\nBecause the scenes are usually not planar, alignment needs to be performed\ncontinuously by extracting relevant common information. In this paper, we\napproximate the shape of the targets by polygons and use affine transformation\nfor aligning the two video sequences. After background subtraction, keypoints\non the contour of the foreground blobs are detected using DCE (Discrete Curve\nEvolution)technique. These keypoints are then described by the local shape at\neach point of the obtained polygon. The keypoints are matched based on the\nconvexity of polygon's vertices and Euclidean distance between them. Only good\nmatches for each local shape polygon in a frame, are kept. To achieve a global\naffine transformation that maximises the overlapping of infrared and visible\nforeground pixels, the matched keypoints of each local shape polygon are stored\ntemporally in a buffer for a few number of frames. The matrix is evaluated at\neach frame using the temporal buffer and the best matrix is selected, based on\nan overlapping ratio criterion. Our experimental results demonstrate that this\nmethod can provide highly accurate registered images and that we outperform a\nprevious related method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 19:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-18"}

At very low luminosities the\nspectrum is very soft, becoming rapidly harder as the luminosity increases and\nthen, above a particular luminosity, softening again.

The spectra were therefore\nsummed in luminosity bins and fitted with a variety of models. The best fitting\nmodel consists of two power laws, one unabsorbed and another, more luminous,\nwhich is absorbed. In this model, we find a range of intrinsic 0.5-10.0 keV\nluminosities of approximately 1.1-3.5 ergs/s, and a very large range of\nabsorbing columns, of approximately 10^22 - 10^24 cm^-2.

Taking a step along this path, we\nanalyze simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) by calculating\nenergy and stress power spectra in stratified isothermal shearing box\nsimulations in several new ways. We divide our boxes in two regions, disc and\ncorona where the disc is the MRI unstable region and corona is the magnetically\ndominated region. We calculate the fractional power in different quantities,\nincluding magnetic energy and Maxwell stresses and find that they are dominated\nby contributions from the lowest wave numbers. This is even more dramatic for\nthe corona than the disc, suggesting that transport in the corona region is\ndominated by larger structures than the disc. By calculating averaged power\nspectra in one direction of $k$ space at a time, we also show that the MRI\nturbulence is strongly anisotropic on large scales when analyzed by this\nmethod, but isotropic on small scales. Although the shearing box itself is\nmeant to represent a local section of an accretion disc, the fact that the\nstress and energy are dominated by the largest scales highlights that the\nlocality is not captured within the box. This helps to quantify the intuitive\nimportance of global simulations for addressing the question of locality of\ntransport, for which similar analyses can be performed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 22:15:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2014 19:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-28"}

This paper proposes a data-driven\nprojection-based model reduction technique to reduce this computational cost.\nThe proposed technique has two distinctive features. First, the model reduction\nstrategy is tailored to inverse problems: the snapshots used to construct the\nreduced-order model are computed adaptively from the posterior distribution.\nPosterior exploration and model reduction are thus pursued simultaneously.\nSecond, to avoid repeated evaluations of the full-scale numerical model as in a\nstandard MCMC method, we couple the full-scale model and the reduced-order\nmodel together in the MCMC algorithm. This maintains accurate inference while\nreducing its overall computational cost. In numerical experiments considering\nsteady-state flow in a porous medium, the data-driven reduced-order model\nachieves better accuracy than a reduced-order model constructed using the\nclassical approach.

Measuring B-modes\nrequires dramatic improvements in sensitivity combined with exquisite control\nof systematics. The BICEP2 telescope observed from the South Pole with a 26~cm\naperture and cold, on-axis, refractive optics. BICEP2 also adopted a new\ndetector design in which beam-defining slot antenna arrays couple to\ntransition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers, all fabricated on a common substrate.\nThe antenna-coupled TES detectors supported scalable fabrication and\nmultiplexed readout that allowed BICEP2 to achieve a high detector count of 500\nbolometers at 150 GHz, giving unprecedented sensitivity to B-modes at degree\nangular scales. After optimization of detector and readout parameters, BICEP2\nachieved an instrument noise-equivalent temperature of 15.8 $\\mu$K sqrt(s). The\nfull data set reached Stokes Q and U map depths of 87.2 nK in square-degree\npixels (5.2 $\\mu$K arcmin) over an effective area of 384 square degrees within\na 1000 square degree field.

For this purpose, we approach the question from three\nperspectives. Firstly, we look at the situation from the standard quantum\nangle, more specifically the de Broglie wavelength analysis of the behavior of\nmacroscopic entities, indicate how a problem with spin and identity arises, and\nillustrate how both play a fundamental role in well-established experimental\nquantum-macroscopical phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensates. Secondly,\nwe analyze how the question is influenced by our result in axiomatic quantum\ntheory, which proves that standard quantum theory is structurally incapable of\ndescribing separated entities. Thirdly, we put forward our new 'conceptual\nquantum interpretation', including a highly detailed reformulation of the\nquestion to confront the new insights and views that arise with the foregoing\nanalysis. At the end of the final section, a nuanced answer is given that can\nbe summarized as follows. The specific and very classical perception of human\nseeing -- light as a geometric theory -- and human touching -- only ruled by\nPauli's exclusion principle -- plays a role in our perception of macroscopic\nentities as ontologically stable entities in space. To ascertain quantum\nbehavior in such macroscopic entities, we will need measuring apparatuses\ncapable of its detection.

The number of the dimensionless\ngravitational couplings is also reduced to two. $\\chi(D)$ can be determined\norder by order in series of $D-4$, whose first several coefficients are\ncalculated. It has a universal value of $1/2$ at $D=4$. The familiar ambiguous\n$\\nabla^2 R$ term is fixed. At the $D \\to 4$ limit, the conformal anomaly $E_D$\njust yields the combination $E_4=G_4-2\\nabla^2 R/3$, which induces Riegert's\neffective action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 06:17:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 01:50:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 May 2014 08:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-11"}

We\nanalytically check that this phase transition between the smaller and larger\nmass black holes obey Ehrenfest relations defined at the critical point and\nhence confirm a second order phase transition. This include both the rotating\nand charged black holes in Einstein gravity. Apart from studying these issues,\nbased on a canonical framework, we also investigate the critical behavior in\ncharged AdS black holes. The scaling laws for these black holes are found to be\ncompatible with the static scaling hypothesis.

Different from traditional cellular communication, its high\nmobility makes it essential to implement power allocation along the time. In\nthe HSR case, the transmission rate depends greatly on the distance between the\nbase station (BS) and the train. As a result, the train receives a time varying\ndata rate service when passing by a BS. It is clear that the most efficient\npower allocation will spend all the power when the train is nearest from the\nBS, which will cause great unfairness along the time. On the other hand, the\nchannel inversion allocation achieves the best fairness in terms of constant\nrate transmission. However, its power efficiency is much lower. Therefore, the\npower efficiency and the fairness along time are two incompatible objects.

Large deviations between the abundances of\nthe host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation\nfollows the core-accretion scenario. These deviations stem from the separate\nevolution of gas and dust in the disk, where the dust forms the planet cores,\nfollowed by the final run-away accretion of the left-over gas. ProDiMo\nprotoplanetary disk models are used to predict the chemical evolution of gas\nand ice in the midplane. We find that cosmic rays play a crucial role in slowly\nun-blocking the CO, where the liberated oxygen forms water, which then freezes\nout quickly. Therefore, the C/O ratio in the gas phase is found to gradually\nincrease with time, in a region bracketed by the water and CO ice-lines. In\nthis regions, C/O is found to approach unity after about 5 Myrs, scaling with\nthe cosmic ray ionisation rate. We then explore how the atmospheric chemistry\nand cloud properties in young gas giants are affected when the non-solar C/O\nratios predicted by the disk models are assumed. The DRIFT cloud formation\nmodel is applied to study the formation of atmospheric clouds under the\ninfluence of varying primordial element abundances and its feedback onto the\nlocal gas. We demonstrate that element depletion by cloud formation plays a\ncrucial role in converting an oxygen-rich atmosphere gas into carbon-rich gas\nwhen non-solar, primordial element abundances are considered as suggested by\ndisk model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 11:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-25"}

Finally, we assess,\nfor the first time, the performance of the different functionals for Subsystem\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on non-covalently interacting\nsystems. We find that the different Laplacian-level meta-GGA kinetic\nfunctionals may improve the description of different properties of electronic\nsystems but no clear overall advantage is found over the best GGA functionals.\nConcerning Subsystem DFT calculations, the here proposed L0.4 kinetic energy\nfunctional is competitive with state-of-the-art GGAs, whereas all other\nLaplacian-level functionals fail badly. The performance of the Laplacian-level\nfunctionals is rationalized thanks to a two-dimensional reduced-gradient and\nreduced-Laplacian decomposition of the non-additive kinetic energy density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 13:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-19"}

Therefore new parsing\ntechniques are developed. However these need to be evaluated. The shortage on\nreal data restrains the corpus-based models to small sizes.

Taking\nadvantage of the multi-angle and multi-energy feature realized by the S$_n$\nmethod in our code, we reveal the genuine characteristics of spatially three\ndimensional (3D) neutrino transfer such as non-radial fluxes and non-diagonal\nEddington tensors. In addition, we assess the ray-by-ray approximation, turning\noff the lateral-transport terms in our code. We demonstrate that the ray-by-ray\napproximation tends to propagate fluctuations in thermodynamical states around\nthe neutrino-sphere along each radial ray and overestimate the variations\nbetween the neutrino distributions on different radial rays. We find that the\ndifference in the densities and fluxes of neutrinos between the ray-by-ray\napproximation and the full Boltzmann transport becomes ~20%, which is also the\ncase for the local heating rate, whereas the volume-integrated heating rate in\nthe Boltzmann transport is found to be only slightly larger (~2%) than the\ncounterpart in the ray-by-ray approximation due to cancellation among different\nrays.

Dark matter annihilation plays a key role at early times as it sets\nthe relic abundance of the particles once they have decoupled from the\nprimordial plasma. A weak annihilation cross section naturally leads to a\ncosmological abundance in agreement with observations. Dark matter species\nsubsequently annihilate - or decay - during Big Bang nucleosynthesis and could\nplay havoc with the light element abundances unless they offer a possible\nsolution to the $^{7}$Li problem.

This is accomplished by using\na unitary coupled-channel model taking, as bare interaction, the extension to\nfour flavors and spin symmetry of the Weinberg-Tomozawa interaction potential.\nA special attention is paid to the inclusion of heavy-quark spin symmetry and\nto the studies of the generated baryon resonances which complete the\nheavy-quark spin multiplets. We reproduce few charmed and strange baryon\nresonances found experimentally, that is, \\Lambda_c(2595), \\Lambda_c(2625),\n\\Xi_c(2790), \\Xi_c(2815), and make predictions for more states. The\nbottom-flavored \\Lambda_b(5912) and \\Lambda_b(5920) states, found by the LHCb\ncollaboration, are also obtained by our model, thus these resonances can be\ninterpreted as molecular states. We also study \\Xi_b resonances, which belong\nto the same SU(3) x HQSS multiplets as the observed \\Lambda_b particles.\nFinally we analyze hidden-charm baryon resonances. In this sector, we predict\nseven N-like and five \\Delta-like states with masses around 4 GeV, most of them\nas bound states, and compare them with predictions from other models. The\npredicted states can be searched for in future experiments that involve studies\nof heavy-flavor physics, e.g. PANDA/FAIR, where charm physics will be analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 15:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-19"}

The absence of a clear cut\ninstability mechanism, the spatio-temporal intermittent character and extremely\nlong lived transients are some of the major difficulties encountered in these\nflows and have hindered progress towards understanding the transition process.\nWe will show for the case of pipe flow that concepts from nonlinear dynamics\nand statistical physics can help to explain the onset of turbulence. In\nparticular the turbulent structures ('puffs') observed close to onset are\nspatially localized chaotic transients and their lifetimes increase super\nexponentially with Reynolds number. At the same time fluctuations of individual\nturbulent puffs can (although very rarely) lead to the nucleation of new puffs.\nThe competition between these two stochastic processes gives rise to a\nnon-equilibrium phase transition where turbulence changes from a\nsuper-transient to a sustained state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 15:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-19"}

Assuming a-prior knowledge of packet arrivals,\ndeadlines and channel realizations, we show that the problem can be formulated\nas a convex program. For both time-invariant and time-varying fading channels,\nit is revealed that the optimal transmission between any two consecutive\nchannel or data state changing instants, termed epoch, can only take one of the\nthree strategies: (i) no transmission, (ii) transmission with an\nenergy-efficiency (EE) maximizing rate over part of the epoch, or (iii)\ntransmission with a rate greater than the EE-maximizing rate over the whole\nepoch. Based on this specific structure, efficient algorithms are then\ndeveloped to find the optimal policies that minimize the total energy\nconsumption with a low computational complexity. The proposed approach can\nprovide the optimal benchmarks for practical schemes designed for transmissions\nof delay-limited data arrivals, and can be employed to develop efficient online\nscheduling schemes which require only causal knowledge of data arrivals and\ndeadline requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 02:28:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 01:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-27"}
