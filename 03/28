Analyzing a sample of 116 supernovae, several\nmagnitude measurements are defined, together with decline rates at different\nepochs, and time durations of different phases. It is found that magnitudes\nmeasured at maximum light correlate more strongly with decline rates than those\nmeasured at other epochs: brighter supernovae at maximum generally have faster\ndeclining light-curves at all epochs. We find a relation between the decline\nrate during the 'plateau' phase and peak magnitudes, which has a dispersion of\n0.56 magnitudes, offering the prospect of using type II supernovae as purely\nphotometric distance indicators. Our analysis suggests that the type II\npopulation spans a continuum from low-luminosity events which have flat\nlight-curves during the 'plateau' stage, through to the brightest events which\ndecline much faster. A large range in optically thick phase durations is\nobserved, implying a range in progenitor envelope masses at the epoch of\nexplosion. During the radioactive tails, we find many supernovae with faster\ndeclining light-curves than expected from full trapping of radioactive\nemission, implying low mass ejecta. It is suggested that the main driver of\nlight-curve diversity is the extent of hydrogen envelopes retained before\nexplosion. Finally, a new classification scheme is introduced where\nhydrogen-rich events are typed as simply 'SNII' with an s2 value giving the\ndecline rate during the 'plateau' phase, indicating its morphological type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 16:35:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Apr 2014 18:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The\nappearance of a voltage step allows to measure the time spent in the metastable\nstate before the transition to the running state, thus defining an escape time.\nThe distribution of the escape times depends upon the characteristics of the\nnoise and the Josephson junction. Moreover, the properties of the distribution\ndepends on the features of the signal (amplitude, frequency and phase), which\ncan be therefore inferred through the appropriate signal processing methods.\nSignal detection with JJ is interesting for practical purposes, inasmuch as the\nsuperconductive elements can be (in principle) cooled to the absolute zero and\ntherefore can add (in practice) as little intrinsic noise as refrigeration\nallows.

The\nEnsemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a family of ensemble-based data assimilation\napproaches that has gained wide popularity due its simple formulation, ease of\nimplementation, and good practical results. Most EnKF algorithms assume that\nthe underlying probability distributions are Gaussian. Although this assumption\nis well accepted, it is too restrictive when applied to large nonlinear models,\nnonlinear observation operators, and large levels of uncertainty. Several\napproaches have been proposed in order to avoid the Gaussianity assumption. One\nof the most successful strategies is the maximum likelihood ensemble filter\n(MLEF) which computes a maximum a posteriori estimate of the state assuming the\nposterior distribution is Gaussian. MLEF is designed to work with nonlinear and\neven non-differentiable observation operators, and shows good practical\nperformance. However, there are limits to the degree of nonlinearity that MLEF\ncan handle. This paper proposes a new ensemble-based data assimilation method,\nnamed the \"sampling filter\", which obtains the analysis by sampling directly\nfrom the posterior distribution. The sampling strategy is based on a Hybrid\nMonte Carlo (HMC) approach that can handle non-Gaussian probability\ndistributions. Numerical experiments are carried out using the Lorenz-96 model\nand observation operators with different levels of non-linearity and\ndifferentiability. The proposed filter is also tested with shallow water model\non a sphere with linear observation operator.

The TOF system data is well-fit by a relatively simple empirical\nabsorption model that indicates nanoWatt-level saturation powers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 17:27:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2014 18:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Because many of these old field stars also have\nindependently measured asteroseismic ages, measurements of rotation and\nactivity are particularly interesting in the context of age-rotation-activity\nrelations. In particular, age-rotation relations generally lack good\ncalibrators at old ages, a problem that this Kepler sample of old-field stars\nis uniquely suited to address. We study the surface rotation and photometric\nmagnetic activity of a subset of 540 solar-like stars on the main- sequence and\nthe subgiant branch for which stellar pulsations have been measured. The\nrotation period was determined by comparing the results from two different\nanalysis methods: i) the projection onto the frequency domain of the\ntime-period analysis, and ii) the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the light\ncurves. Reliable surface rotation rates were then extracted by comparing the\nresults from two different sets of calibrated data and from the two\ncomplementary analyses. We report rotation periods for 310 out of 540 targets\n(excluding known binaries and candidate planet-host stars); our measurements\nspan a range of 1 to 100 days.

Estimates of\n~$10^{3}$ neutron stars in the central parsec of the Galaxy and similar numbers\nin small elliptical galaxies and globular clusters along with an estimated high\nprobability of ms-pulsar formation in those environments has led many workers\nto propose the use of ms-pulsar timing to measure the mass and spin of\nintermediate mass black holes. Models of pulsar motion around a rotating black\nhole generally assume geodesic motion of a \"test\" particle in the Kerr metric.\nThese approaches account for well-known effects like de Sitter precession and\nthe Lense-Thirring effect but they do not account for the non-linear effect of\nthe pulsar's stress-energy tensor on the space-time metric. Here we model the\nmotion of a pulsar near a black hole with the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD)\nequations. Numerical integration of the MPD equations for black holes of mass 2\nX $10^{6}$, $10^{5}$ and $10^{3}$ solar masses shows that the pulsar will not\nremain in an orbital plane with motion vertical to the plane being largest\nrelative to the orbit's radial dimensions for the lower mass black holes. The\npulsar's out of plane motion will lead to timing variations that are up to ~10\nmicroseconds different from those predicted by planar orbit models. Such\nvariations might be detectable in long term observations of millisecond\npulsars. If pulsar signals are used to measure the mass and spin of\nintermediate mass black holes on the basis of dynamical models of the received\npulsar signal then the out of plane motion of the pulsar should be part of that\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 18:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Since the introduction of prime event structures, many variants of\nevent structures have been proposed with different behavioural relations and,\nhence, with differences in their expressive power. One of the possible benefits\nof using a more expressive event structure is that of having a more compact\nrepresentation for the same behaviour when considering the number of events\nused in a prime event structure. Therefore, this article addresses the problem\nof reducing the size of an event structure while preserving behaviour under a\nwell-known notion of equivalence, namely history preserving bisimulation. In\nparticular, we investigate this problem on two generalisations of the prime\nevent structures. The first one, known as asymmetric event structure, relies on\na asymmetric form of the conflict relation. The second one, known as flow event\nstructure, supports a form of disjunctive causality. More specifically, we\ndescribe the conditions under which a set of events in an event structure can\nbe folded into a single event while preserving the original behaviour. The\nsuccessive application of this folding operation leads to a minimal size event\nstructure. However, the order on which the folding operation is applied may\nlead to different minimal size event structures. The latter has a negative\nimplication on the potential use of a minimal size event structure as a\ncanonical representation for behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 19:27:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jun 2014 09:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-01"}

In order to reproduce many of the overall features of fully\natomistic MD, which is inherently more expensive, the equations of motion in\nmesodynamics must be derivable from an interaction potential that is faithful\nto the compressive equation of state, as well as to tensile de-cohesion that\noccurs along the boundaries of the mesoscale units.

Knowing distances are essential in determining\nmeaningful physical characteristics for these sources and this has been\ndifficult to determine for most objects previously. The distances were\ndetermined by modelling their spectral energy distributions (SED) with multiple\nblack-body curves, and integrating under the overall fit to determine the total\ndistance-dependent flux.

Among many ensuing engineering challenges is\nthe need to better understand the fundamental limits of forward error\ncorrection in non-asymptotic regimes. This article characterizes the\nperformance of random block codes over finite-state channels and evaluates\ntheir queueing performance under maximum-likelihood decoding. In particular,\nclassical results from information theory are revisited in the context of\nchannels with rare transitions, and bounds on the probabilities of decoding\nfailure are derived for random codes. This creates an analysis framework where\nchannel dependencies within and across codewords are preserved. Such results\nare subsequently integrated into a queueing problem formulation. For instance,\nit is shown that, for random coding on the Gilbert-Elliott channel, the\nperformance analysis based on upper bounds on error probability provides very\ngood estimates of system performance and optimum code parameters. Overall, this\nstudy offers new insights about the impact of channel correlation on the\nperformance of delay-aware, point-to-point communication links.

Models of up to 938 solar masses are\nconstructed with the Mesa code, and their linear stability in the fundamental\nmode, assumed to be the most dangerous, is analysed with a fully nonadiabatic\nmethod. Models above 100 MSun have extended tenuous atmospheres (\"shelves\")\nthat affect the stability of the fundamental. Even when positive, this growth\nrate is small, in agreement with previous results. We argue that small growth\nrates lead to saturation at small amplitudes that are not dangerous to the\nstar. A mechanism for saturation is demonstrated involving nonlinear parametric\ncoupling to short-wavelength g modes and the damping of the latter by radiative\ndiffusion. The shelves are subject to much more rapidly growing strange modes.\nThis also agrees with previous results but is extended here to higher masses.\nThe strange modes probably saturate via shocks rather than mode coupling but\nhave very small amplitudes in the core, where almost all of the stellar mass\nresides. Although our stellar models are hydrostatic, the structure of their\nouter parts suggests that optically thick winds, driven by some combination of\nradiation pressure, transsonic convection, and strange modes, are more likely\nthan pulsation in the fundamental mode to limit the main-sequence lifetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 22:54:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 19:05:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-18"}

We apply our test procedure to\nreal biological data: in a test-retest data set of neural connectome graphs, we\nare able to distinguish between scans from different subjects; and in the {\\em\nC.elegans} connectome, we are able to distinguish between chemical and\nelectrical networks.

In this paper, we propose a change-of-variable and relaxation\nmethod to solve the quantile optimization problems without using the calculus\nof variations or making any monotonicity assumptions. The method is\ndemonstrated through a portfolio choice problem under rank-dependent utility\ntheory (RDUT). We show that this problem is equivalent to a classical Merton's\nportfolio choice problem under expected utility theory with the same utility\nfunction but a different pricing kernel explicitly determined by the given\npricing kernel and probability weighting function. With this result, the\nfeasibility, well-posedness, attainability and uniqueness issues for the\nportfolio choice problem under RDUT are solved. It is also shown that solving\nfunctional optimization problems may reduce to solving probabilistic\noptimization problems.

This scenario violates the principle of unitarity as required for\nquantum mechanics and leads to the acclaimed \"information loss paradox\". This\nparadox has become an obstacle or a reversed touchstone for any possible theory\nto unify the gravity and quantum mechanics.

First, the inflaton perturbation must account for much more than\n$10\\%$ of the curvature perturbation $\\zeta$, which barring fine-tuning means\nthat it accounts for practically all of it. It follows that a curvaton-like\nmechanism for generating $\\zeta$ requires an alternative to slow roll such as\nk-inflation. Second, accepting slow-roll inflation, the excursion of the\ninflaton field is at least of order Planck scale.

The holonomy cocycle of a foliation and its\nexterior powers as well as its tensor powers provide examples of multiplicative\ncocycles. Next, we define the Lyapunov exponents of such a cocycle with respect\nto a harmonic probability measure directed by the lamination. We also prove an\nOseledec multiplicative ergodic theorem in this context. This theorem implies\nthe existence of an Oseledec decomposition almost everywhere which is holonomy\ninvariant. Moreover, in the case of differentiable cocycles, we establish\neffective integral estimates for the Lyapunov exponents. These results find\napplications in the geometric and dynamical theory of laminations. They are\nalso applicable to (not necessarily closed) laminations with singularities.\nInteresting holonomy properties of a generic leaf of a foliation are obtained.\nThe main ingredients of our method are the theory of Brownian motion, the\nanalysis of the heat diffusions on Riemannian manifolds, the ergodic theory in\ndiscrete dynamics and a geometric study of laminations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 10:51:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2015 21:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

In contrast,\nthe second law of thermodynamics, which is a macroscopic physical\nrepresentation of the world, is able to describe irreversible processes in an\nisolated system through the change of entropy S larger than 0. It is the\nattempt of the present manuscript to bridge the microscopic physical world with\nits macrosocpic one with an alternative approach than the statistical mechanics\ntheory of Gibbs and Boltzmann. It is proposed that time is discrete with\nconstant step size. Its consequence is the presence of time irreversibility at\nthe microscopic level if the present force is of complex nature (i.e. not\nconst). In order to compare this discrete time irreversible mechamics (for\nsimplicity a classical, single particle in a one dimensional space is selected)\nwith its classical Newton analog, time reversibility is reintroduced by scaling\nthe time steps for any given time step n by the variable sn leading to the\nNose-Hoover Lagrangian. The corresponding Nose-Hoover Hamiltonian comprises a\nterm Ndf *kB*T*ln(sn) (with kB the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, and\nNdf the number of degrees of freedom) which is defined as the microscopic\nentropy Sn at time point n multiplied by T. Upon ensemble averaging this\nmicroscopic entropy Sn in equilibrium for a system which does not have fast\nchanging forces approximates its macroscopic counterpart known from\nthermodynamics. The presented derivation with the resulting analogy between the\nensemble averaged microscopic entropy and its thermodynamic analog suggests\nthat the original description of the entropy by Boltzmann and Gibbs is just an\nensemble averaging of the time scaling variable sn which is in equilibrium\nclose to 1, but that the entropy term itself has its root not in statistical\nmechanics but rather in the discreteness of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 14:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Our analysis rests on the notion of useful flux, which for a\nthermoelectric system is the electrical current and for Feynman's ratchet is\nthe effective jump frequency. Our approach yields original insight into the\nderivation and analysis of the system's properties. In particular we define an\nentropy per tooth in analogy with the entropy per carrier or Seebeck\ncoefficient, and we derive the analogue to Kelvin's second relation for\nFeynman's ratchet. Owing to the formal similarity between the heat fluxes\nbalance equations for a thermoelectric generator (TEG) and those for Feynman's\nratchet, we introduce a distribution parameter that quantifies the amount of\nheat that flows through the cold and hot sides of both heat engines. While it\nis well established that $\\gamma$ = 1/2 for a TEG, it is equal to 1 for\nFeynman's ratchet. This implies that no heat may be rejected in the cold\nreservoir for the latter case. Further, the analysis of the efficiency at\nmaximum power shows that the so-called Feynman efficiency corresponds to that\nof an exoreversible engine, with $\\gamma$ = 1. Then, turning to the nonlinear\nregime, we generalize the approach based on the convection picture and\nintroduce two different types of resistance to distinguish the dynamical\nbehavior of the considered system from its ability to dissipate energy.

To solve these equations, massively parallel codes\nhave been developed and run on present-day supercomputers. This paper describes\nmeasures to improve the efficiency of such computations, thereby making them\nmore realistic. Explicit Runge-Kutta schemes are considered to be well suited\nfor time-stepping. Although the numerical algorithms are often highly\noptimized, performance can still be improved by a suitable choice of the\ntime-stepping scheme, based on spectral analysis of the underlying operator.\nHere, an operator splitting technique is introduced to combine first-order\nRunge-Kutta-Chebychev schemes for the collision term with fourth-order schemes\nfor the remaining terms. In the nonlinear regime, based on the observation of\neigenvalue shifts due to the (generalized) $E\\times B$ advection term, an\naccurate and robust estimate for the nonlinear timestep is developed. The\npresented techniques can reduce simulation times by factors of up to three in\nrealistic cases. This substantial speedup encourages the use of similar\ntimestep optimized explicit schemes not only for the gyrokinetic equation, but\nalso for other applications with comparable properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 14:54:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-31"}

Despite the fact that these\nnonspecific potentials are omnipresent, their description has been a major\nchallenge from experimental and theoretical points of view.

Two related settings are considered. In the first setting the\nimpurity is injected in the fluid with some initial velocity ${\\mathbf v}_0$,\nand we are interested in its velocity at infinite time, ${\\mathbf v}_\\infty$.\nWe derive a rigorous upper bound on $|{\\mathbf v}_0-{\\mathbf v}_\\infty|$ for\ninitial velocities smaller than the generalized critical velocity. In the limit\nof vanishing impurity-fluid coupling this bound amounts to ${\\mathbf\nv}_\\infty={\\mathbf v}_0$ which can be regarded as a rigorous proof of the\nLandau criterion of superfluidity. In the case of a finite coupling the\nvelocity of the impurity can drop, but not to zero; the bound quantifies the\nmaximal possible drop. In the second setting a small constant force is exerted\nupon the impurity. We argue that two distinct dynamical regimes exist --\nbackscattering oscillations of the impurity velocity and saturation of the\nvelocity without oscillations. For fluids with $v_{c {\\rm L}}=v_s$ (where $v_{c\n{\\rm L}}$ and $v_s$ are the Landau critical velocity and sound velocity,\nrespectively) the latter regime is realized. For fluids with $v_{c {\\rm L}} <\nv_s$ both regimes are possible. Which regime is realized in this case depends\non the mass of the impurity, a nonequilibrium quantum phase transition\noccurring at some critical mass.

The position of these\nlines is given by the zeros of an explicit polynomial which only depends on the\nratio of the funnel lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 15:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

It is demonstrated by test particle\nsimulations that minor ions can be nearly fully picked up by intrinsic\nAlfv\\'en-cyclotron waves observed in the solar wind based on the observed wave\nenergy density. Both high frequency ion-cyclotron waves and low frequency\nAlfv\\'en waves play crucial roles in the pickup process. A minor ion can first\ngain a high magnetic moment through the resonant wave-particle interaction with\nion-cyclotron waves, and then this ion with a large magnetic moment can be\ntrapped by magnetic mirror-like field structures in the presence of the\nlower-frequency Alfv\\'en waves. As a result, the ion is picked up by these\nAlfv\\'en-cyclotron waves. However, minor ions can only be partially picked up\nin the corona due to low wave energy density and low plasma beta. During the\npickup process, minor ions are stochastically heated and accelerated by\nAlfv\\'en-cyclotron waves so that they are hotter and flow faster than protons.\nThe compound effect of Alfv\\'en waves and ion-cyclotron waves is important on\nthe heating and acceleration of minor ions. The kinetic properties of minor\nions from simulation results are generally consistent with in situ and remote\nfeatures observed in the solar wind and solar corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 12:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-07"}

This approach needs many realizations for\nestablishing statistical results on the system under study. It is very\ncomputationnally demanding, and with the advent of large models this burden is\nincreasing. Hence parallel implementation of SSA are needed to address these\nneeds.\n  At the very heart of the SSA is the selection of the next reaction to occur\nat each time step, and to the best of our knowledge all implementations are\nbased on an inverse transformation method. However, this method involves a\nrandom number of steps to select this next reaction and is poorly amenable to a\nparallel implementation.\n  Results: Here, we introduce a parallel acceptance-rejection algorithm to\nselect the K next reactions to occur. This algorithm uses a deterministic\nnumber of steps, a property well suited to a parallel implementation. It is\nsimple and small, accurate and scalable. We propose a Graphics Processing Unit\n(GPU) implementation and validate our algorithm with simulated propensity\ndistributions and the propensity distribution of a large model of yeast iron\nmetabolism. We show that our algorithm can handle thousands of selections of\nnext reaction to occur in parallel on the GPU, paving the way to massive SSA.\n  Availability: We present our GPU-AR algorithm that focuses on the very heart\nof the SSA. We do not embed our algorithm within a full implementation in order\nto stay pedagogical and allows its rapid implementation in existing software.\nWe hope that it will enable stochastic modelers to implement our algorithm with\nthe benefits of their own optimizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 11:11:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-02"}

However, supernova spectra exhibit emission that is generally blue\nshifted. While this characteristic has been reported in many supernovae, it is\nrarely discussed in any detail. Here we present an analysis of H-alpha\nemission-peaks using a dataset of 95 type II supernovae, quantifying their\nstrength and time evolution. Using a post-explosion time of 30d, we observe a\nsystematic blueshift of H-alpha emission, with a mean value of -2000 kms-1.\nThis offset is greatest at early times but vanishes as supernovae become\nnebular. Simulations of Dessart et al. (2013) match the observed behaviour,\nreproducing both its strength and evolution in time. Such blueshifts are a\nfundamental feature of supernova spectra as they are intimately tied to the\ndensity distribution of ejecta, which falls more rapidly than in stellar winds.\nThis steeper density structure causes line emission/absorption to be much more\nconfined; it also exacerbates the occultation of the receding part of the\nejecta, biasing line emission to the blue for a distant observer.
