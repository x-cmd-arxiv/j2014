The fraction\nof clumpy galaxies in star-forming galaxies with Mstar > 10^9.5 Msun decreases\nwith time from ~0.35 at 0.8<z<1.0 to ~0.05 at 0.2<z<0.4 irrespective of the\nstellar mass, although the fraction tends to be slightly lower for massive\ngalaxies with Mstar > 10^10.5 Msun at each redshift. On the other hand, the\nfraction of clumpy galaxies increases with increasing both SFR and SSFR in all\nthe redshift ranges we investigated. In particular, we found that the SSFR\ndependences of the fractions are similar among galaxies with different stellar\nmasses, and the fraction at a given SSFR does not depend on the stellar mass in\neach redshift bin. The evolution of the fraction of clumpy galaxies from z~0.9\nto z~0.3 seems to be explained by such SSFR dependence of the fraction and the\nevolution of SSFRs of star-forming galaxies. The fraction at a given SSFR also\nappears to decrease with time, but this can be due to the effect of the\nmorphological K-correction. We suggest that these results are understood by the\ngravitational fragmentation model for the formation of giant clumps in disk\ngalaxies, where the gas mass fraction is a crucial parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 17:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

For solid state electron-spin qubits the\ninteraction with nuclear spins is the main problem. One particular, neradicable\nsource of electron decoherence arises from decoherence of the nuclear spin\nbath, driven by nuclear-nuclear dipolar interactions. Due to its many-body\nnature nuclear decoherence is difficult to predict, especially for an important\nclass of strained nanostructures where nuclear quadrupolar effects have a\nsignificant but largely unknown impact. Here we report direct measurement of\nnuclear spin bath coherence in individual strained InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots:\nnuclear spin-echo coherence times in the range T2~1.2 - 4.5 ms are found. Based\non these T2 values we demonstrate that quadrupolar interactions make nuclear\nfluctuations in strained quantum dots much slower compared to lattice matched\nGaAs/AlGaAs structures. Such fluctuation suppression is particularly strong for\narsenic nuclei due to the effect of atomic disorder of gallium and indium\nalloying.

Our main results are\nthe first for a quantum mechanical mean-field dynamics for fermions; in\nprevious works, the mean-field limit is usually either coupled to a\nsemiclassical limit, or the interaction is scaled down so much, that the system\nbehaves freely for large particle number $N$. We consider the fermionic Hartree\nequations (i.e., the Hartree-Fock equations without exchange term) in this\nwork, since the exchange term is subleading in our setting. The main result is\nthat the fermionic Hartree dynamics approximates the Schr\\\"odinger dynamics\nwell for large $N$. We give explicit values for the rates of convergence. We\nprove two types of results. The first type is very general and concerns\narbitrary free Hamiltonians (e.g., relativistic, non-relativistic, with\nexternal fields) and arbitrary interactions. The theorems give explicit\nconditions on the solutions to the fermonic Hartree equations under which a\nderivation of the mean-field dynamics succeeds. The second type of results\nscrutinizes situations where the conditions are fulfilled. These results are\nabout non-relativistic free Hamiltonians with external fields, systems with\ntotal kinetic energy bounded by $const \\cdot N$ and with long-range\ninteractions of the form $|x|^{-s}$, with $0 < s < \\frac{6}{5}$ (sometimes, for\ntechnical reasons, with a weaker or cut off singularity). We prove our main\nresults by using a new method for deriving mean-field dynamics developed by\nPickl in [Lett. Math. Phys., 97(2):151-164, 2011]. This method has been applied\nsuccessfully in quantum mechanics for deriving the bosonic Hartree and\nGross-Pitaevskii equations.

In this\nwork we prove that the conjecture is true in all non-degenerate settings (e.g.,\nwhere the probability density function of unknown channel coefficients exists\nand is bounded). The DoF collapse even when perfect channel knowledge for one\nuser is available to the transmitter. This also settles a related recent\nconjecture by Tandon et al. The key to our proof is a bound on the number of\ncodewords that can cast the same image (within noise distortion) at the\nundesired receiver whose channel is subject to finite precision CSIT, while\nremaining resolvable at the desired receiver whose channel is precisely known\nby the transmitter. We are also able to generalize the result along two\ndirections. First, if the peak of the probability density function is allowed\nto scale as O(P^(\\alpha/2)), representing the concentration of probability\ndensity (improving CSIT) due to, e.g., quantized feedback at rate\n(\\alpha/2)\\log(P), then the DoF are bounded above by 1+\\alpha, which is also\nachievable under quantized feedback. Second, we generalize the result to the K\nuser broadcast channel with K antennas at the transmitter and a single antenna\nat each receiver. Here also the DoF collapse under non-degenerate channel\nuncertainty. The result directly implies a collapse of DoF to unity under\nnon-degenerate channel uncertainty for the general K-user interference and MxN\nuser X networks as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 19:36:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-07"}

There\nis today a growing interest in understanding when and why a description in\nterms of a multiplex network is necessary and more informative than a\nsingle-layer projection. Here, we contribute to this debate by presenting a\ncomprehensive study of correlations in multiplex networks. Correlations in node\nproperties, especially degree-degree correlations, have been thoroughly studied\nin single-layer networks. Here we extend this idea to investigate and\ncharacterize correlations between the different layers of a multiplex network.\nSuch correlations are intrinsically multiplex, and we first study them\nempirically by constructing and analyzing several multiplex networks from the\nreal-world. In particular, we introduce various measures to characterize\ncorrelations in the activity of the nodes and in their degree at the different\nlayers, and between activities and degrees. We show that real-world networks\nexhibit indeed non-trivial multiplex correlations.

These crisis resolutions are often accompanied by austerity programs\ncausing political and social friction on both domestic and international\nlevels. The question of how to resolve failing financial institutions under\nwhich economic preconditions is therefore a pressing and controversial issue of\nvast political importance. In this work we employ an agent-based model to study\nthe economic and financial ramifications of three highly relevant crisis\nresolution mechanisms. To establish the validity of the model we show that it\nreproduces a series of key stylized facts if the financial and real economy.\nThe distressed institution can either be closed via a purchase & assumption\ntransaction, it can be bailed-out using taxpayer money, or it may be bailed-in\nin a debt-to-equity conversion.

For economies in recession with high unemployment the\nbail-in tool provides the most efficient crisis resolution mechanism.

The outcome of the dust radial migration is governed\nby simple criteria between the dust-to-gas ratio and the exponents p and q of\nthe surface density and temperature power laws. The transfer of radiation\nprovides an additional constraint between these quantities because the disc\nthermal structure is fixed by the dust spatial distribution. To assess which\ndiscs are primarily affected by the radial-drift barrier, we used the radiative\ntransfer code MCFOST to compute the temperature structure of a wide range of\ndisc models, stressing the particular effects of grain size distributions and\nvertical settling.\n  We find that the outcome of the dust migration process is very sensitive to\nthe physical conditions within the disc. For high dust-to-gas ratios (> 0.01)\nor flattened disc structures (H/R < 0.05), growing dust grains can efficiently\ndecouple from the gas, leading to a high concentration of grains at a critical\nradius of a few AU. Decoupling of grains can occur at a large fraction (> 0.1)\nof the initial radius, for a dust-to-gas ratio greater than ~ 0.05. The exact\nvalue of the required dust-to-gas ratio for dust to stop its migration is\nstrongly dependent on the disc temperature structure.

Within the current constraints on quantities such as the\nsum of neutrino masses $\\sum m_\\nu$, running of the primordial spectral index\n$d n_s/d \\ln k$ and WDM particle mass $m_{\\rm WDM}$, the statistics of the 21\ncm forest manifest observationally significant differences that become larger\nat higher redshifts. In particular, it may be possible to probe the range of\n$m_{\\rm WDM} \\gtrsim 10$ keV that may otherwise be inaccessible. Future\nobservations of the 21 cm forest by the Square Kilometer Array may offer a\nunique and valuable probe of the SSPS, as long as radio sources such as quasars\nor Population III gamma-ray bursts with sufficient brightness and number exist\nat redshifts of $z \\gtrsim$ 10 - 20, and the astrophysical effects of\nreionization and heating can be discriminated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 22:02:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 22:13:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-16"}

These self-sustained rhythms are coordinated and\nentrained by a master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).\nWithin the SCN, the individual rhythms of each neuron are synchronized through\nintercellular signaling. One important feature of SCN is that the synchronized\nperiod is close to the cell population mean of intrinsic periods. In this way,\nthe synchronized period of the SCN stays close to the periods of cells in\nperipheral tissues. This is important for SCN to entrain cells throughout the\nbody. However, the mechanism that drives the period of the coupled SCN cells to\nthe population mean is not known. We use mathematical modeling and analysis to\nshow that the mechanism of transcription repression plays a pivotal role in\nregulating the coupled period. Specifically, we use phase response curve\nanalysis to show that the coupled period within the SCN stays near the\npopulation mean if transcriptional repression occurs via protein sequestration.\nIn contrast, the coupled period is far from the mean if repression occurs\nthrough highly nonlinear Hill-type regulation (e.g. oligomer- or\nphosphorylation-based repression). Furthermore, we find that the timescale of\nintercellular coupling needs to be fast compared to that of intracellular\nfeedback to maintain the mean period. These findings reveal the important\nrelationship between the intracellular transcriptional feedback loop and\nintercellular coupling. This relationship explains why transcriptional\nrepression appears to occur via protein sequestration in multicellular\norganisms, mammals and Drosophila, in contrast with the phosphorylation-based\nrepression in unicellular organisms. That is, transition to protein\nsequestration is essential for synchronizing multiple cells with a period close\nto the population mean (~24hr).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 22:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-10"}

While the\neigenvalues and the eigenstates of the model are known already, analytical\ndetermination of their degeneracy is presented here for the first time. The\nfull solution, including degeneracy count, is achieved for each spin\nconfiguration by mapping the Hubbard model into a set of Huckel-annulene\nproblems for rings of variable size. The number and size of these effective\nHuckel annulenes, both crucial to obtain Hubbard states and their degeneracy,\nare determined by solving a well-known combinatorial enumeration problem, the\nnecklace problem for $N-1$ beads and two colors, within each subgroup of the\n$C_{N-1}$ permutation group. Symmetry-adapted solution of the necklace\nenumeration problem is finally achieved by means of the subduction of coset\nrepresentation technique [S. Fujita, Theor. Chim.

In epidemic routing, messages are\nrelayed by intermediate nodes at contact opportunities, i.e., when pairs of\nnodes come within the transmission range of each other. Each node needs to\ndecide whether to forward its message upon contact with a new node based on its\nown residual energy level and the age of that message. We mathematically\ncharacterize the fundamental trade-off between energy conservation and a\nmeasure of Quality of Service as a dynamic energy-dependent optimal control\nproblem.

In this paper, we analyze flux calibrated optical\nspectra to measure accurate spectral types and extinctions of 283 nearby T\nTauri stars. The primary advances in this paper are (1) the incorporation of a\nsimplistic accretion continuum in optical spectral type and extinction\nmeasurements calculated over the full optical wavelength range and (2) the\nuniform analysis of a large sample of stars. Comparisons between the\nnon-accreting TTS photospheric templates and stellar photosphere models are\nused to derive conversions from spectral type to temperature. Differences\nbetween spectral types can be subtle and difficult to discern, especially when\naccounting for accretion and extinction. The spectral types measured here are\nmostly consistent with spectral types measured over the past decade. However,\nour new spectral types are 1-2 subclasses later than literature spectral types\nfor the original members of the TWA and are discrepant with literature values\nfor some well known Taurus CTTSs. Our extinction measurements are consistent\nwith other optical extinction measurements but are typically 1 mag lower than\nnIR measurements, likely the result of methodological differences and the\npresence of nIR excesses in most CTTSs. As an illustration of the impact of\naccretion, SpT, and extinction uncertainties on the HR diagrams of young\nclusters, we find that the resulting luminosity spread of stars in the TWA is\n15-30%.

Previous work showed that\nthis is especially so in encounters that truncate large parts of the outer\ndisc. The expectation is that the number of completely destroyed discs in a\ncluster depends also on the mass distribution within the discs. Here we test\nthis hypothesis by determining the influence of encounters on the disc fraction\nand average disc mass in clusters of various stellar densities for different\nmass distributions in the discs. This is done by performing Nbody6 simulation\nof a variety of cluster environments, where we track the encounter dynamics and\ndetermine the mass loss due to these encounters for different disc-mass\ndistributions. We find that although the disc mass distribution has a\nsignificant impact on the disc losses for specific star-disc encounters, the\noverall disc frequency generally remains rather unaffected. The reason is that\nin single encounters the dependence on the mass distribution is strongest if\nboth stars have very different masses. Such encounters are rather infrequent in\nsparse clusters. In dense clusters such encounters are more common, however,\nhere the disc frequency is largely determined by encounters between low-mass\nstars such that the overall disc frequency does not change significantly. For\ntidal disruption the disc destruction in clusters is fairly independent of the\nactual distribution of the material in the disc. The all determining factor\nremains the cluster density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2014 12:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

For short times the decay of the\nBEC fraction is Gaussian while for intermediate to long times, it is well\ndescribed by a stretched exponential with an exponent that depends on the\ninitial effective dimensionality of the system. These results are potentially\nrelevant for cold trapped-ion experiments which can simulate an equivalent of\nhard-core bosons, i.e. spins, with tunable long-range interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2014 12:57:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Jul 2014 00:18:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Oct 2014 08:36:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

It perhaps plays an important role in the astrophysical system\nwhich, in the solar interior, leads to the heat accumulation at the bottom of\nthe convection layer and then motivates the convection motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2014 14:24:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 01:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-10"}

The new\nmethod utilizes time-reversibility properties of one-dimensional diffusions and\nis applicable to all one-dimensional diffusion processes with finite\nspeed-measure. One advantage of the new approach is that simple simulation\nmethods like the Milstein scheme can be applied to bridge simulation. Another\nadvantage over previous bridge simulation methods is that the proposed method\nworks well for diffusion bridges in long intervals because the computational\ncomplexity of the method is linear in the length of the interval. For\n$\\rho$-mixing diffusions the approximate method is shown to be particularly\naccurate for long time intervals. In a simulation study, we investigate the\naccuracy and efficiency of the approximate method and compare it to exact\nsimulation methods.

Spectral roll-over in\nthe 5-10 keV band was originally detected in in the deepest XMM-Newton\nobservations of the brightest sources; this is confirmed in subsequent NuSTAR\nspectra. This emission can be modeled via Comptonization, but with low electron\ntemperatures (kT_e ~ 2 keV) and high optical depths (tau ~ 10) that pose\nnumerous difficulties. Moreover, evidence of cooler thermal emission that can\nbe fit with thin disk models persists, even in fits to joint XMM-Newton and\nNuSTAR observations.

Small variations in external drivers can\nlead to abrupt changes associated with instabilities and bifurcations in the\nunderlying dynamics2-4. Anticipating critical transitions and divergence from\nthe present state of the system is particularly crucial to the prevention or\nmitigation of the effects of unwanted and irreversible changes5-10. Recent\nresearch in ecology has focused on leading indicators of regime shift in\necosystems characterized by one state variable5,7,11,12. The case of systems\nwith several mutually interacting components, however, has remained poorly\ninvestigated13, while the connection between network stability and research on\nindicators for loss of resilience has been elusive14.
