Previous models do not match the morphology of observed\n(rotation period)-color diagrams, notably the existence of a relatively\nlong-lived \"C-sequence\" of fast rotators first identified by Barnes(2003). This\nfailure motivates the Metastable Dynamo Model (MDM) described here. The MDM\nposits that stars are born with their magnetic dynamos operating in a mode that\ncouples very weakly to the stellar wind, so their (initially very short)\nrotation periods at first change little with time. At some point, this mode\nspontaneously and randomly changes to a strongly-coupled mode, the transition\noccurring with a mass-dependent lifetime that is of order 100 MYr. I show that\nwith this assumption, one can obtain good fits to observations of young\nclusters, particularly for ages of 150 MYr to 200 MYr. Previous models and the\nMDM both give qualitative agreement with the morphology of the slower-rotating\n\"I-sequence\" stars, but none of them have been shown to accurately reproduce\nthe stellar-mass-dependent evolution of the I-sequence stars, especially for\nclusters older than a few hundred MYr.

Our aim is to understand how the\npresence of neutral atoms in the prominence plasma influences the instability\ngrowth rate, and the evolution of velocity, magnetic field vector and\nthermodynamic parameters of turbulent drops. We perform 2.5D numerical\nsimulations of the instability initiated by a multi-mode perturbation at the\ncorona-prominence interface using a single-fluid MHD approach including a\ngeneralized Ohm's law. The initial equilibrium configuration is purely\nhydrostatic and contains a homogeneous horizontal magnetic field forming an\nangle with the direction in which the plasma is perturbed. We analyze\nsimulations with two different orientations of the magnetic field. For each\nfield orientation we compare two simulations, one for the pure MHD case, and\none including the ambipolar diffusion in the Ohm's law (AD case). Other than\nthat, both simulations for each field orientation are identical. The numerical\nresults in the initial stage of the instability are compared with the\nanalytical linear calculations. We find that the configuration is always\nunstable in the AD case. The growth rate of the small-scale modes in the\nnon-linear regime is up to 50% larger in the AD case than in the purely MHD\ncase and the average velocities of flows are a few percent larger.

We also discuss how the dynamical model\ncan be distinguished from the standard chaotic inflation model based on a\nquadratic inflaton potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 17:05:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 04:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We show that both\nenergy dissipation and momentum transport along electric current in the current\nlayer are locally quasi-static, but globally dynamic and irreversible.\nTurbulent drag dissipates both the streaming energy of the current sheet and\nthe associated magnetic energy.

Electron trapping\nand de-trapping drive local momentum transports, while phase mixing converts\nconvective momentum into thermal momentum.

In particular, most invasive\nplants are clonal, cluster through vegetative propagation, and compete locally.\nDispersal limitation implies that invasive spread occurs as advance of an\necological interface between invader and resident species. Interspecific\ncompetition along the interface produces random variation in the extent of\ninvasive growth. Development of these random fluctuations, termed stochastic\nroughening, will often structure the interface as a self-affine fractal; a\nseries of power-law scaling relationships follows as a result. For a diverse\narray of local growth processes exhibiting both forward and lateral\npropagation, the extent of invader advance becomes spatially correlated along\nthe interface, and the width of the interface (the area where invader and\nresident compete directly) increases as a power function of time. Once\nroughening equilibrates statistically, interface width and the location of the\nmost advanced invader (the \"front-runner\") beyond the mean incursion should\nboth increase as a power function of interface length. To test these\npredictions, we let white clover (Trifolium repens) invade ryegrass (Lolium\nperenne) experimentally. Spatial correlation developed as anticipated, and both\ninterface width and the front-runner's lead scaled as a power law of length.\nHowever, the scaling exponents differed, likely a consequence of clover's\ngrowth morphology. The theory of kinetic roughening offers a new framework for\nunderstanding causes and consequences of spatial pattern in between-species\ninteraction, and indicates when interface measures at a local scale predict\nproperties of an invasive front at extended spatial scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 18:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-19"}

The most advocated explanation involves a variation of n_s with scales\n(denoted as running) that has a magnitude significantly greater than the\ngeneric slow roll predictions. We instead study the possibility that the large\nscale temperature anisotropies are not enhanced because of a suppression of the\nscalar power at large scales. Such a situation can be achieved for instance by\na sudden change of the speed of the inflaton (by about 14 %), and we show that\nit fits the temperature anisotropies and polarization data considerably better\nthan a constant running (its chi^2 improves by ~ 7.5 over that of the constant\nrunning, at the cost of one more parameter). We also consider the possibility\nthat the large scale temperature fluctuations are suppressed by an\nanti-correlation between tensor and scalar modes. Unfortunately, while such\neffect does affect the temperature fluctuations at large scales, it does not\naffect the temperature power spectrum and cannot, therefore, help in\nreconciling a large value of r with the limits from temperature fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 19:57:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 19:31:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 14:17:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 5 Jul 2014 14:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The\natomic structure of the tip, the tip radius, the contact angles of the liquid\non the two surfaces, and the volume of the liquid bridge are varied. The\ncapillary force between the tip and substrate is calculated as a function of\ntheir separation h. The force agrees with continuum predictions for h down to ~\n5 to 10nm. At smaller h, the force tends to be less attractive than predicted\nand has strong oscillations. This oscillatory component of the capillary force\nis completely missed in the continuum theory, which only includes contributions\nfrom the surface tension around the circumference of the meniscus and the\npressure difference over the cross section of the meniscus. The oscillation is\nfound to be due to molecular layering of the liquid confined in the narrow gap\nbetween the tip and substrate. This effect is most pronounced for large tip\nradii and/or smooth surfaces. The other two components considered by the\ncontinuum theory are also identified. The surface tension term, as well as the\nmeniscus shape, is accurately described by the continuum prediction for h down\nto ~ 1nm, but the capillary pressure term is always more positive than the\ncorresponding continuum result. This shift in the capillary pressure reduces\nthe average adhesion by a factor as large as 2 from its continuum value and is\nfound to be due to an anisotropy in the pressure tensor. The cross-sectional\ncomponent is consistent with the capillary pressure predicted by the continuum\ntheory (i.e., the Young-Laplace equation), but the normal pressure that\ndetermines the capillary force is always more positive than the continuum\ncounterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 20:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-10"}

Unless population are well-mixed (like bacteria in a\nshaken test tube), the spreading dynamics not only depends on fitness\ndifferences but also on the dispersal behavior of the species. Spreading at a\nconstant speed is generally predicted when dispersal is sufficiently\nshort-ranged. However, the case of long-range dispersal is unresolved: While it\nis clear that even rare long-range jumps can lead to a drastic speedup, it has\nbeen difficult to quantify the ensuing stochastic growth process. Yet such\nknowledge is indispensable to reveal general laws for the spread of modern\nhuman epidemics, which is greatly accelerated by aviation. We present a simple\niterative scaling approximation supported by simulations and rigorous bounds\nthat accurately predicts evolutionary spread for broad distributions of long\ndistance dispersal. In contrast to the exponential laws predicted by\ndeterministic \"mean-field\" approximations, we show that the asymptotic growth\nis either according to a power-law or a stretched exponential, depending on the\ntails of the dispersal kernel. More importantly, we provide a full\ntime-dependent description of the convergence to the asymptotic behavior which\ncan be anomalously slow and is needed even for long times. Our results also\napply to spreading dynamics on networks with a spectrum of long-range links\nunder certain conditions on the probabilities of long distance travel and are\nthus relevant for the spread of epidemics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 22:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Unfortunately, most existing methods fail to take advantage of the\nspatial information in data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a\nStructured Sparse regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SS-NMF) method\nfrom the following two aspects. First, we incorporate a graph Laplacian to\nencode the manifold structures embedded in the hyperspectral data space.

Power companies are interested in finding the most\nefficient configuration for minimization of real power loses and load balancing\namong distribution feeders to save energy and enhance the over all performance\nof distribution system.\n  This thesis presents a fast and efficient method for load-flow analysis of\nradial distribution networks. The proposed method is based on linear data\nstructure. The order of time and space complexity is reported here. There is\nsignificant saving in no. of steps execution. Using graph theory concept and\nexploiting multi-cores architecture, the proposed method for load flow can be\nfurther investigated for obtaining more optimized solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 06:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-20"}

In this work, we\ninvestigate the fundamental topological and fractal properties of recurrence\nnetworks constructed from fractional Brownian motions (FBMs). First, our\nresults indicate that the constructed recurrence networks have exponential\ndegree distributions; the relationship between $H$ and $<\\lambda>$ can be\nrepresented by a cubic polynomial function. We next focus on the motif rank\ndistribution of recurrence networks, so that we can better understand networks\nat the local structure level. We find the interesting superfamily phenomenon,\ni.e. the recurrence networks with the same motif rank pattern being grouped\ninto two superfamilies. Last, we numerically analyze the fractal and\nmultifractal properties of recurrence networks. We find that the average\nfractal dimension $<d_{B}>$ of recurrence networks decreases with the Hurst\nindex $H$ of the associated FBMs, and their dependence approximately satisfies\nthe linear formula $<d_{B}> \\approx 2 - H$. Moreover, our numerical results of\nmultifractal analysis show that the multifractality exists in these recurrence\nnetworks, and the multifractality of these networks becomes stronger at first\nand then weaker when the Hurst index of the associated time series becomes\nlarger from 0.4 to 0.95. In particular, the recurrence network with the Hurst\nindex $H=0.5$ possess the strongest multifractality. In addition, the\ndependence relationships of the average information dimension $<D(1)>$ and the\naverage correlation dimension $<D(2)>$ on the Hurst index $H$ can also be\nfitted well with linear functions. Our results strongly suggest that the\nrecurrence network inherits the basic characteristic and the fractal nature of\nthe associated FBM series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 07:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In lower vertebrates\nsuch as frogs and turtles, due to the active mechanism in hair cells, hair\nbundles(stereocilia) can be spontaneously oscillating or quiescent. Recently,\nthe amplitude death phenomenon has been proposed [K.-H. Ahn, J. R. Soc.\nInterface, {\\bf 10}, 20130525 (2013)] as a mechanism for auditory transduction\nin frog hair-cell bundles, where sudden cessation of the oscillations arises\ndue to the coupling between non-identical hair bundles. The gating of the ion\nchannel is intrinsically stochastic due to the stochastic nature of the\nconfiguration change of the channel. The strength of the noise due to the\nchannel gating can be comparable to the thermal Brownian noise of hair bundles.\nThus, we perform stochastic simulations of the elastically coupled hair\nbundles. In spite of stray noisy fluctuations due to its stochastic dynamics,\nour simulation shows the transition from collective oscillation to amplitude\ndeath as inter-bundle coupling strength increases. In its stochastic dynamics,\nthe formation of the amplitude death state of coupled hair bundles can be seen\nas a sudden suppression of the displacement fluctuation of the hair bundles as\nthe coupling strength increases. The enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio\nthrough the amplitude death phenomenon is clearly seen in the stochastic\ndynamics. Our numerical results demonstrate that the multiple number of\ntransduction channels per hair bundle is an important factor to the amplitude\ndeath phenomenon, because the phenomenon may disappear for a small number of\ntransduction channels due to strong gating noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 08:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The synergic\napplication of Near Edge X ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy and\nConductive Atomic Force Microscopy is a powerful way for such purpose allowing\na full characterization of simple and composite samples, including specimens\nwith dielectric discontinuities. Graphene Oxide/Gold (GO/Au) and Graphene\nOxide/Silicon Oxide (GO/SiO2) have been selected as proof by example. The\nresults show that the approach allow to relate chemical, electronic and\nphysical properties to morphological features and local conductance behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 08:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-20"}

Generally\nthe sensitising dye employs a carboxylic anchoring moiety through which it\nadheres to the TiO2 surface. Recent interest in exploiting the properties of\ndiffering TiO2 electrode morphologies, such as rutile nanorods exposing the\n(110) surface and anatase electrodes with high percentages of the (001) surface\nexposed, begs the question of whether this anchoring strategy is best,\nirrespective of the majority surface exposed. Here we address this question by\npresenting density functional theory calculations contrasting the binding\nproperties of two promising anchoring groups, phosphonic acid and boronic acid,\nto that of carboxylic acid. Anchor-electrode interactions are studied for the\npro- totypical anatase (101) surface, along with the anatase (001) and rutile\n(110) surfaces. Finally the effect of using these alternative anchoring groups\nto bind a typical coumarin dye (NKX- 2311) to these TiO2 substrates is\nexamined. Significant differences in the binding properties are found depending\non both the anchor and surface, illustrating that the choice of anchor is\nnecessarily dependent upon the surface exposed in the electrode. In particular\nthe boronic acid is found to show the potential to be an excellent anchor\nchoice for electrodes exposing the anatase (001) surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 10:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-20"}

The phase\ndiagram of the non-conserving model, derived from G(r), is found to be\ndifferent from the conserving one. This difference, which stems from the\nnon-convexity of G(r), is analogous to ensemble inequivalence found in\nequilibrium systems with long-range interactions.

Using subliminal information of speech, denominated as\nprosody, it is possible to recognize the emotional state of the person. One of\nthe main problems in the design of automatic emotion recognition systems is the\nsmall number of available patterns. This fact makes the learning process more\ndifficult, due to the generalization problems that arise under these\nconditions. In this work we propose a solution to this problem consisting in\nenlarging the training set through the creation the new virtual patterns. In\nthe case of emotional speech, most of the emotional information is included in\nspeed and pitch variations. So, a change in the average pitch that does not\nmodify neither the speed nor the pitch variations does not affect the expressed\nemotion. Thus, we use this prior information in order to create new patterns\napplying a gender dependent pitch shift modification in the feature extraction\nprocess of the classification system. For this purpose, we propose a frequency\nscaling modification of the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, used to\nclassify the emotion. For this purpose, we propose a gender dependent frequency\nscaling modification.

The\nfundamental idea behind the algorithm is to learn a sparse representation in\ntwo phases. In the first phase, the whole training dataset is partitioned into\nsmall non-overlapping subsets, and a dictionary is trained independently on\neach small database. In the second phase, the dictionaries are merged to form a\nglobal dictionary.

Particular attention is paid to the\nmobility of oxygen vacancies throughout the doped TiO$_2$ lattice, as a means\nby which charge compensation of trivalent dopants can occur. The effect that Al\ndoping of TiO$_2$ electrodes has in dye sensitised solar cells is explained as\na result of this mobility and charge compensation. Substitutional defects in\nwhich one Al3+ replaces one Ti4+ are found to introduce valence band holes,\nwhile intrinsic oxygen vacancies are found to introduce states in the band-gap.\nCoupling two of these substitutional defects with an oxygen vacancy results in\nexothermic defect formation which maintain charge neutrality.

The\naccretion regimes that allow growth of the WDs are usually calculated assuming\nconstant mass-transfer rates. However, it is possible that these systems are\ninfluenced by effects that cause the rate to fluctuate on various timescales.\nWe investigate how long-term mass-transfer variability affects accreting WDs\nsystems. We show that, if such variability is present, it expands the parameter\nspace of binaries where the WD can effectively increase its mass. Furthermore,\nwe find that the supernova type Ia (SNIa) rate is enhanced by a factor 2-2.5 to\na rate that is comparable with the lower limit of the observed rates. The\nchanges in the delay-time distribution allow for more SNIae in stellar\npopulations with ages of a few Gyr. Thus, mass-transfer variability gives rise\nto a new formation channel of SNIa events that can significantly contribute to\nthe SNIa rate. Mass-transfer variability is also likely to affect other binary\npopulations through enhanced WD growth. For example, it may explain why WDs in\ncataclysmic variables are observed to be more massive than single WDs, on\naverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 13:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-20"}

Instantaneous population firing rate\n(IPFR) $R(t)$, which is directly obtained from the raster plot of neural\nspikes, is often used as a realistic collective quantity describing population\nactivities in both the computational and the experimental neuroscience. For the\ncase of spiking neurons, a realistic time-domain order parameter, based on\n$R(t)$, was introduced in our recent work to characterize the spike\nsynchronization transition. Unlike the case of spiking neurons, the IPFR $R(t)$\nof bursting neurons exhibits population behaviors with both the slow bursting\nand the fast spiking timescales. For our aim, we decompose the IPFR $R(t)$ into\nthe instantaneous population bursting rate $R_b(t)$ (describing the bursting\nbehavior) and the instantaneous population spike rate $R_s(t)$ (describing the\nspiking behavior) via frequency filtering, and extend the realistic order\nparameter to the case of bursting neurons.

The atmosphere is an integral component of many high-energy\nastroparticle detectors. Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes and\ncosmic-ray extensive air shower detectors are the two instruments driving the\nrapidly evolving fields of very-high- and ultra-high-energy astrophysics. In\nthese instruments, the atmosphere is used as a giant calorimeter where cosmic\nrays and gamma rays deposit their energy and initiate EASs; it is also the\nmedium through which the resulting Cherenkov light propagates. Uncertainties in\nreal-time atmospheric conditions and in the fixed atmospheric models typically\ndominate all other systematic errors. With the improved sensitivity of upgraded\nIACTs such as H.E.S.S.-II and MAGIC-II and future facilities like the Cherenkov\nTelescope Array (CTA) and JEM-EUSO, statistical uncertainties are expected to\nbe significantly reduced, leaving the atmosphere as the limiting factor in the\ndetermination of astroparticle spectra. Varying weather conditions necessitate\nthe development of suitable atmospheric monitoring to be integrated in the\noverall instrument calibration, including Monte Carlo simulations.

The Mackey algebra\n$\\mu_{R}(G)$ shares a lot of properties with the group algebra $RG$ however,\nthere are some differences. For example, the group algebra is a symmetric\nalgebra and this is not always the case for the Mackey algebra. In this paper\nwe present a systematic approach to the question of the symmetricity of the\nMackey algebra, by producing symmetric associative bilinear forms for the\nMackey algebra. The category of Mackey functors is a closed symmetric monoidal\ncategory, so using the formalism of J.P. May for these categories, S. Bouc has\ndefined the so-called Burnside trace. Using this Burnside trace we produce\ntrace maps for Mackey algebras which generalize the usual trace map the group\nalgebras. These trace maps factorise through Burnside algebras. We prove that\nthe Mackey algebra $\\mu_{R}(G)$ is a symmetric algebra if and only if the\nfamily of Burnside algebras $(RB(H))_{H\\leqslant G}$ is a family of symmetric\nalgebras with a compatibility condition. As a corollary, we recover the well\nknown fact that over a field of characteristic zero, the Mackey algebra is\nalways symmetric. Over the ring of integers the Mackey algebra of $G$ is\nsymmetric if and only if the order of $G$ is square free. Finally, over a field\nof characteristic $p>0$ we show that the Mackey algebra is symmetric if and\nonly if the Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ are of order $1$ or $p$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 15:01:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 09:21:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-18"}

We combine these with gas masses estimated from 12CO and HI data in\norder to investigate the star formation efficiency (SFE) in a larger sample of\nETGs than previously available. We first recalibrate (based on WISE data) the\nrelation between old stellar populations (traced at Ks-band) and 22um\nluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission from\ncircumstellar dust. We then go on to investigate the position of ETGs on the\nKennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation. Molecular gas-rich ETGs have comparable star\nformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they lie\nsystematically offset from the KS relation, having lower star formation\nefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). This effect\nis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material is\nin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. We show here for\nthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass per\nunit time is lower in ETGs, it seems that the amount of stars formed per\nfree-fall time is approximately constant. The scatter around this dynamical\nrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of the\npotential in the inner regions. This leads us to suggest that dynamical\nproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be important\nsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatter\naround star-formation relations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 15:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}
