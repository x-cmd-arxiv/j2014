To this end, we\npropose some prox-functions for which the cor- responding subproblem of OSGA is\nsolved in a closed form. Considering various inverse problems arising in signal\nand image processing, machine learning, statistics, we report extensive\nnumerical and compar- isons with several state-of-the-art solvers proposing\nfavourably performance of our algorithm. We also compare with the most widely\nused optimal first-order methods for some smooth and nonsmooth con- vex\nproblems. Surprisingly, when some Nesterov-type optimal methods originally\nproposed for smooth problems are adapted for solving nonsmooth problems by\nsimply passing a subgradient instead of the gradient, the results of these\nsubgradient-based algorithms are competitive and totally interesting for\nsolving nonsmooth problems. Finally, the OSGA software package is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 16:01:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 May 2014 17:16:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 May 2014 07:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-28"}

It can be used to carry out\nvery long baseline interferometry. Although the original theoretical analysis,\nthat uses wave interaction effects, is rigorous, it is not easy to understand.\nThe present article therefore carries out a simpler analysis, using the\nautocorrelation of intensity fluctuations, which is easier to understand. It is\nbased on published experiments that were carried out to validate the original\ntheory. The autocorrelation analysis also validates simple numerical\ntechniques, based on the autocorrelation, to model the angular intensity\ndistribution of a source.

Challenging the conventional bandwidth limit, we design an\nextremely wideband circular waveguide septum polarizer, covering $42\\%$\nbandwidth, from 77 GHz to 118 GHz, without any undesired resonance. Stokes\nparameters constructed from the measured data in between 77 GHz and 115 GHz\nshow that the leakage from $I$ to $Q$ and $U$ is below $\\pm 2\\%$ and the $Q-U$\nmutual leakage below $\\pm 1\\%$. Such a performance is comparable to other\nmodern polarizers, but the bandwidth of this polarizer can be at least twice as\nwide. This extremely wide-band design removes the major weakness of the septum\npolarizer and opens up a new window for future astronomical polarization\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2014 17:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-03"}

We\nshow that irradiation feedback leads to cyclic mass transfer episodes, allowing\nCBSs to be observed in-between as binary radio pulsars under conditions in\nwhich standard, non-irradiated models predict the occurrence of a low mass\nX-ray binary. This behavior accounts for the existence of a family of eclipsing\nbinary systems known as redbacks. We predict that redback companions should\nalmost fill their Roche lobe, as observed in PSR J1723-2837. This state is also\npossible for systems evolving with larger orbital periods. Therefore, binary\nradio pulsars with companion star masses usually interpreted as larger than\nexpected to produce HeWDs may also result in such {\\it quasi - Roche Lobe\nOverflow} states, rather than hosting a carbon-oxygen WD.\n  We found that CBSs with initial orbital periods $\\mathrm{P_{i}<1}$ day evolve\ninto redbacks.

The dynamical models are based on anisotropic\nJeans equations, constrained by HST/ACS imaging and the central velocity\ndispersion of the galaxies, extracted from good-quality spectra taken by the\nDEEP2 survey. The population $(M/L)_{\\rm pop}$ are derived from full-spectrum\nfitting of the same spectra with a grid of simple stellar population models.\nRecent dynamical modelling results by the $ATLAS^{3D}$ project and numerical\nsimulations of galaxy evolution indicate that the dark matter fraction within\nthe central regions of our galaxies should be small. This suggest that our\nderived total $(M/L)_{\\rm dyn}$ should closely approximate the stellar $M/L$.\nOur comparison of $(M/L)_{\\rm dyn}$ and $(M/L)_{\\rm pop}$ then imply that for\ngalaxies with stellar mass $M_\\odot \\geq 10^{11}$ $M_{\\odot}$, the $average$\nnormalization of the IMF is consistent with a Salpeter slope, with a\nsubstantial scatter.

This is a\nsignificant improvement over the 100 electrons per cubic centimeter upper limit\noffered by infrared [S III] line ratios from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our\nestimates are sensitive to a number of factors including temperature and\ngeometry. However using reasonable values for each, our unshocked mass estimate\nagrees with predictions from dynamical models. We also consider the presence,\nor absence, of cold iron- and carbon-rich ejecta and how these affect our\ncalculations. Finally we reconcile the intrinsic absorption from unshocked\nejecta with the turnover in Cas A's integrated spectrum documented decades ago\nat much lower frequencies. These and other recent observations below 100 MHz\nconfirm that spatially resolved thermal absorption, when extended to lower\nfrequencies and higher resolution, will offer a powerful new tool for low\nfrequency astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Mar 2014 00:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

We consider cognitive radio networks where the secondary receivers\nare able to harvest energy from the radio frequency when they are idle. The\nsecondary system provides simultaneous wireless power and secure information\ntransfer to the secondary receivers. We propose a multi-objective optimization\nframework for the design of a Pareto optimal resource allocation algorithm\nbased on the weighted Tchebycheff approach. In particular, the algorithm design\nincorporates three important system objectives: total transmit power\nminimization, energy harvesting efficiency maximization, and interference power\nleakage-to-transmit power ratio minimization. The proposed framework takes into\naccount a quality of service requirement regarding communication secrecy in the\nsecondary system and the imperfection of the channel state information of\npotential eavesdroppers (idle secondary receivers and primary receivers) at the\nsecondary transmitter. The adopted multi-objective optimization problem is\nnon-convex and is recast as a convex optimization problem via semidefinite\nprogramming (SDP) relaxation. It is shown that the global optimal solution of\nthe original problem can be constructed by exploiting both the primal and the\ndual optimal solutions of the SDP relaxed problem. Besides, two suboptimal\nresource allocation schemes for the case when the solution of the dual problem\nis unavailable for constructing the optimal solution are proposed.

The model yields good fits of the UV and Lyman-alpha LFs at\nz>~2. The weak evolution of both LFs between z=2 and z=6 is explained as the\ncombined effect of the negative evolution of the halo mass function, of the\nincrease with redshift of the star formation efficiency, and of dust\nextinction. The slope of the faint end of the UV LF is found to steepen with\nincreasing redshift, implying that low luminosity galaxies increasingly\ndominate the contribution to the UV background at higher and higher redshifts.\nThe observed range of UV luminosities at high-z implies a minimum halo mass\ncapable of hosting active star formation M_crit <~ 10^9.8 M_odot, consistent\nwith the constraints from hydrodynamical simulations. From fits of Lyman-alpha\nLFs plus data on the luminosity dependence of extinction and from the measured\nratios of non-ionizing UV to Lyman-continuum flux density for samples of z=~3\nLyman break galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters, we derive a simple relationship\nbetween the escape fraction of ionizing photons and the star formation rate,\nimpling larger escape fraction for less massive galaxies.

However, the range of the applicability of QAC is not well\nunderstood. It has been shown that QAC can become insufficient for guaranteeing\nthe validity of the adiabatic approximation, but under what conditions the QAC\nwould become necessary has become controversial. Furthermore, it is believed\nthat the inability for the QAC to reveal quantum adiabaticity is due to induced\nresonant transitions. However, it is not clear how to quantify these\ntransitions in general. Here we present a progress to this problem by finding\nan exact relation that can reveal how transition amplitudes are related to QAC\ndirectly. As a posteriori condition for quantum adiabaticity, our result is\nuniversally applicable to any (nondegenerate) quantum system and gives a clear\npicture on how QAC could become insufficient or unnecessary for the adiabatic\napproximation, which is a problem that has gained considerable interest in the\nliterature in recent years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Mar 2014 09:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-13"}

Many other X-ray sources exhibit warm absorption features, and\nthey all show periodic dipping behavior at the same time. Recently, a dipping\nperiodicity has also been determined for GX 13+1 using long-term X-ray folded\nlight-curves, leading to a clear identification of one of such periodic dips in\nan archival Chandra observation. We give the first spectral characterization of\nthe periodic dip of GX 13+1 found in this archival Chandra observation\nperformed in 2010. We used Chandra/HETGS data (1.0-10 keV band) and\ncontemporaneous RXTE/PCA data (3.5-25 keV) to analyze the broadband X-ray\nspectrum. We adopted different spectral models to describe the continuum\nemission and used the XSTAR-derived warm absorber component to constrain the\nhighly ionized absorption features. The 1.0-25 keV continuum emission is\nconsistent with a model of soft accretion-disk emission and an optically thick,\nharder Comptonized component. The dip event, lasting $\\sim$ 450 s, is\nspectrally resolved with an increase in the column density of the neutral\nabsorber, while we do not find significant variations in the column density and\nionization parameter of the warm absorber with respect to the out-of-dip\nspectrum.

In the\nfirst observing season, we obtained 291,911 qualified science frames with\n20-second integrations in the i-band. Photometric precision reaches about 4\nmmag at 20-second cadence at i=7.5, and is about 20 mmag at i=12. Using robust\ndetection methods, ten promising exoplanet candidates were found. Four of these\nwere found to be giants using spectroscopic follow-up. All of these transit\ncandidates are presented here along with the discussion of their detailed\nproperties as well as the follow-up observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Mar 2014 14:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The proposed technique builds\nupon previous research in exposure fusion and expands it to deal with the\nlimited Temporal Dynamic Range of existing sensors and camera technologies. In\nparticular, temporal image fusion enables the rendering of long-exposure\neffects on full frame-rate video, as well as the generation of arbitrarily long\nexposures from a sequence of images of the same scene taken over time. We\nexplore the problem of temporal under-exposure, and show how it can be\naddressed by selectively enhancing dynamic structure.
