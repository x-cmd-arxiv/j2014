Fluid particles are known to separate\nfaster BIT than FIT in three-dimensional turbulence, and we find that inertial\nparticles do the same. However, we find that the irreversibility in the\ninertial particle dispersion is in general much stronger than that for fluid\nparticles. For example, the ratio of the BIT to FIT mean-square separation can\nbe up to an order of magnitude larger for inertial particles than for the fluid\nparticles. We also find that for both the inertial and fluid particles the\nirreversibility becomes stronger as the scale of their separation decreases.\nRegarding the physical mechanism for the irreversibility, we argue that whereas\nthe irreversibility of fluid particle-pair dispersion can be understood in\nterms of a directional bias arising from the energy transfer process in\nturbulence, inertial particles experience an additional source of\nirreversibility arising from the non-local contribution to their velocity\ndynamics, a contribution which vanishes in the limit ${St\\to0}$, where $St$ is\nthe particle Stokes number. For each given initial (final, in the backward in\ntime case) separation $\\bm{r}^0$ there is an optimum value of $St$ for which\nthe dispersion irreversibility is strongest, as such particles are optimally\naffected by both sources of irreversibility.

One interesting research topic discussed in the paper\nis the high-energy radiation produced by Compton scattering of the prompt GRB\nphotons against the shock-accelerated electrons. The difference between the\nforward shock emission in a wind-type and a constant-density medium is also\nstudied, and the emission due to Maxwellian electron injection is compared to\nthe case with pure power-law electrons. The code calculates the time-evolving\nphoton and electron distributions in the emission region by solving the\nrelativistic kinetic equations for each particle species. For the first time,\nthe full relativistic equations for synchrotron emission/absorption, Compton\nscattering, and pair production/annihilation were applied to model the forward\nshock emission. The synchrotron self-absorption thermalization mechanism, which\nshapes the low-energy end of the electron distribution, was also included in\nthe electron equation. The simulation results indicate that inverse Compton\nscattering of the prompt GRB photons can produce a luminous TeV emission\ncomponent, even when pair production in the emission region is taken into\naccount. This very high-energy radiation may be observable in low-redshift\nGRBs. The test simulations also show that the low-energy end of a pure\npower-law distribution of electrons can thermalize owing to synchrotron\nself-absorption in a wind-type environment, but without an observable impact on\nthe radiation spectrum. Moreover, a flattening in the forward shock X-ray light\ncurve may be expected when the electron injection function is assumed to be\npurely Maxwellian instead of a power law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 16:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-24"}

We show\nhow the evolution of a system described by quantum electrodynamics in Coulomb\ngauge is uniquely determined by its initial state and two reduced quantities.\nThese two fundamental observables, the polarization of the Dirac field and the\nvector potential of the photon field, can be calculated by solving two coupled,\nnon-linear evolution equations without the need to explicitly determine the\n(numerically infeasible) many-body wave function of the coupled quantum system.\nTo find reliable approximations to the implicit functionals we present the\naccording Kohn-Sham construction. In the non-relativistic limit this\ndensity-functional-type theory of quantum electrodynamics reduces to the\ndensity-functional reformulation of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, which is based\non the current density of the electrons and the vector potential of the photon\nfield. By making further approximations, e.g. restricting the allowed modes of\nthe photon field, we derive further density functional-type theories of coupled\nmatter-photon systems for the corresponding approximate Hamiltonians. In the\nlimit of only two sites and one mode we deduce the according effective theory\nfor the two-site Hubbard model coupled to one photonic mode.

The angular\nrelationship between the dyes, rather than the distance between them, is shown\nto be responsible for the observed change in energy transfer. It has long been\nthought that Rop increases the bend angle of the R1inv-R2inv complex upon\nbinding, but this has never been directly observed. In contrast, we find an\nincrease in FRET upon the addition of Rop that is shown via modeling to be\nconsistent with a decrease in the bend angle of the complex of\n$-15^{\\circ}\\pm7^{\\circ}$. The model predicts FRET from dye trajectories\ngenerated using molecular dynamics simulations of Cy3 and Cy5 attached to $5'$\nterminal cytosine or guanosine on RNA. While FRET is commonly used to observe\nglobal changes in molecular structure attributed to changes in the distance\nbetween dyes, it is rarely, if ever, used to elucidate angular changes. Subtle\nglobal changes in molecular structure upon binding are generally difficult to\ndiscern using NMR or crystallography, but FRET is well suited to observe these\nchanges because of its sensitivity at interdye distance around the F\\\"orster\nradius, $R_F\\approx5$ nm. While FRET is often referred to and used as a\n\"molecular ruler\" for distances around $R_F$, for dye pairs that have minimal\nrotational freedom, FRET can also be used to observe changes in structure for\nwhich there is no significant change in distance between the dyes.

These models may be inadequate in accurately predicting the\nlosses of super-sized storms, such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In this study,\nwe examined the dependencies of normalized U.S. hurricane loss on both wind\nspeed and storm size for 73 tropical cyclones that made landfall in the U.S.\nfrom 1988 to 2012. A multi-variate least squares regression is used to\nconstruct a hurricane loss model using both wind speed and size as predictors.\nUsing maximum wind speed and size together captures more variance of losses\nthan using wind speed or size alone. It is found that normalized hurricane loss\n(L) approximately follows a power law relation with maximum wind speed (Vmax)\nand size (R). Assuming L=10^c Vmax^a R^b, c being a scaling factor, the\ncoefficients, a and b, generally range between 4-12 and 2-4, respectively. Both\na and b tend to increase with stronger wind speed. For large losses, a weighted\nregression model, with a being 4.28 and b being 2.52, produces a reasonable\nfitting to the actual losses. Hurricane Sandy's size was about 3.4 times of the\naverage size of the 73 storms analyzed. Based on the weighted regression model,\nHurricane Sandy's loss would be 21 times smaller if its size were of the\naverage size with maximum wind speed unchanged. It is important to revise\nconventional empirical hurricane loss models to include both maximum wind speed\nand size as predictors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 22:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The analysis is based on the scattering matrix of the\nthree-terminal junction (comprising of the two electronic terminals and the\nprobe electrode), and a separation of time scales: it is assumed that the rapid\ncharge transfer across the conductor and the rapid relaxation of the electrons\ninside the probe electrode give rise to much slower energy fluctuations in the\nlatter.

We use dynamical network approach to evaluate the collective financial\nfailure---systemic risk---quantified by the fraction of active nodes. The\nsystemic risk can be calculated over any future time period, divided on\nsub-periods, where within each sub-period banks may contiguously fail due to\nlinks to either (i) assets or (ii) other banks, controlled by two parameters,\nprobability of internal failure $p$ and threshold $T_h$ (\"solvency\" parameter).\nThe systemic risk non-linearly increases with $p$ and decreases with average\nnetwork degree faster when all assets are equally distributed across banks than\nif assets are randomly distributed. The more inactive banks each bank can\nsustain (smaller $T_h$), the smaller the systemic risk---for some $T_h$ values\nin I we report a discontinuity in systemic risk. When contiguous spreading\nbecomes stochastic (ii) controlled by probability $p_2$---a condition for the\nbank to be solvent (active) is stochastic---the systemic risk decreases with\ndecreasing $p_2$.

The electron-impurity scattering,\nwhich is shown to play a negligible role in spin relaxation in time domain in\nthis material, has a marked effect on the in-plane spin diffusion due to the\nanisotropic spin precession frequency in the spatial domain. With the\nelectron-impurity and inter-valley electron-phonon scatterings separately\nincluded in the scattering term, we study the intra- and inter-valley diffusion\nprocesses of the in-plane spins by analytically solving the kinetic spin Bloch\nequations. The intra-valley process is found to be dominant in the in-plane\nspin diffusion, in contrast to the case of spin relaxation in time domain,\nwhere the inter-valley process can be comparable to or even more important than\nthe intra-valley one. For the intra-valley process, we find that the in-plane\nspin diffusion is suppressed with the increase of impurity density but\neffectively enhanced by increasing electron density in both the degenerate and\nnondegenerate limits. We also take into account the electron-electron Coulomb\nscattering in the intra-valley process.

We\ndevelop an analytical model that facilitates the optimization of the AC readout\nelectronics design and tuning. This model is applied to cases similar to the\nbolometers in the Planck space mission. We study how the re- sponsivity and the\nnoise equivalent power (NEP) of an AC biased bolometer depend on these\nessential parameters: bias current, heat sink temperature and background power,\nmodulation frequency of the bias, and stray capacitance. We show that the\noptimal AC bias current in the bolometer is significantly different from that\nof the DC case as soon as a stray capacitance is present due to the difference\nin the electrothermal feedback.

At L2, the particle flux is about 5\n$cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ and is dominated by protons incident on the spacecraft.\nProtons with an energy above 40MeV can penetrate the focal plane unit box\ncausing two different effects: glitches in the raw data from direct interaction\nof cosmic rays with detectors (producing a data loss of about 15% at the end of\nthe mission) and thermal drifts in the bolometer plate at 100mK adding\nnon-gaussian noise at frequencies below 0.1Hz.

The key idea is that the\nsecondary system helps to boost the primary system's performance by relaying\nand in return the primary system provides more opportunities for the secondary\nsystem to access the spectrum. In contrast to most of existing works that only\nconsider information cooperation, this paper studies joint information and\nenergy cooperation between the two systems, i.e., the primary transmitter sends\ninformation for relaying and feeds the secondary system with energy as well.\nThis is particularly useful when the secondary transmitter has good channel\nquality to the primary receiver but is energy constrained. We propose and study\nthree schemes that enable this cooperation. Firstly, we assume there exists an\nideal backhaul between the two systems for information and energy transfer. We\nthen consider two wireless information and energy transfer schemes from the\nprimary transmitter to the secondary transmitter using power splitting and time\nsplitting energy harvesting techniques, respectively. For each scheme, the\noptimal and zero-forcing solutions are derived. Simulation results demonstrate\npromising performance gain for both systems due to the additional energy\ncooperation. It is also revealed that the power splitting scheme can achieve\nlarger rate region than the time splitting scheme when the efficiency of the\nenergy transfer is sufficiently large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Mar 2014 11:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Single\nexciton Superradiance, an example of cooperative quantum coherent effect, is\ndestroyed at a critical dephasing strength proportional to the system size,\nshowing robustness of cooperativity to the action of the dephasing environment.\nWe also show that the coupling to a common decay channel contrasts the action\nof dephasing, driving the entanglement decay to slow down on increasing the\nsystem size. Moreover, after a projective measurement which finds the\nexcitation in the system, the entanglement reaches a stationary value,\nindependent of the initial conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Mar 2014 13:38:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 16:23:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 22:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

While the high-frequency peak has already been\nassociated with the oscillations of the hypermassive neutron star produced by\nthe merger and depends on the equation of state, a new correlation emerges\nbetween the low-frequency peak, related to the merger process, and the total\ncompactness of the stars in the binary. More importantly, such a correlation is\nessentially universal, thus providing a powerful tool to set tight constraints\non the equation of state. If the mass of the binary is known from the inspiral\nsignal, the combined use of the two frequency peaks sets four simultaneous\nconstraints to be satisfied.

The strategy for\nobtaining these solutions is to start from Myers-Perry solutions, and then\nconsidering the effects of the dilaton field, Born-Infeld parameter as well as\nthe electric charge as a perturbative parameter. We perform the perturbations\nup to 4th order in the extremal black holes of Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton\ngravity with equal angular momentum and arbitrary dilaton coupling constant. We\ndiscuss the physical properties of these black holes and study their dependence\non the perturbative parameter $q$, the dilaton coupling constant $\\alpha$ and\nthe Born-Infeld parameter $\\beta$. One can see these black holes solutions\nsatisfy a generalized Smarr relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Mar 2014 08:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The HDSP generalizes the\nhierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) to model the correlation structure between\nmetadata in the corpus and mixture components. We construct the HDSP based on\nthe normalized gamma representation of the Dirichlet process, and this\nconstruction allows incorporating a scaling function that controls the\nmembership probabilities of the mixture components. We develop two scaling\nmethods to demonstrate that different modeling assumptions can be expressed in\nthe HDSP. We also derive the corresponding approximate posterior inference\nalgorithms using variational Bayes. Through experiments on datasets of\nnewswire, medical journal articles, conference proceedings, and product\nreviews, we show that the HDSP results in a better predictive performance than\nlabeled LDA, partially labeled LDA, and author topic model and a better\nnegative review classification performance than the supervised topic model and\nSVM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Mar 2014 06:25:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 May 2014 02:59:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 05:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-10"}
