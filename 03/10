Scheduling is also performed inside the switching core, and does\nnot rely on latency-limited communications with input or output line-cards.\nCompared with other legacy switching architectures, the CQ switch has the\nadvantages of high throughput, minimal delay, low scheduling complexity, and no\nspeedup requirement. However, the crosspoint buffers are small and segregated,\nthus how to efficiently use the buffers and avoid packet drops remains a major\nproblem that needs to be addressed. In this paper, we consider load balancing,\ndeflection routing, and buffer pooling for efficient buffer sharing in the CQ\nswitch. We also design scheduling algorithms to maintain the correct packet\norder even while employing multi-path switching and resolve contentions caused\nby multiplexing. All these techniques require modest hardware modifications and\nmemory speedup in the switching core, but can greatly boost the buffer\nutilizations by up to 10 times and reduce the packet drop rates by one to three\norders of magnitude. Extensive simulations and analyses have been done to\ndemonstrate the advantages of the proposed buffering and scheduling techniques\nin various aspects. By pushing the on-chip memory to the limit of current ASIC\ntechnology, we show that a cell drop rate of 10e-8, which is low enough for\npractical uses, can be achieved under real Internet traffic traces\ncorresponding to a load of 0.9.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Mar 2014 20:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-11"}

We construct statistical\nestimators in both harmonic and pixel space, test them on simulated data with\nand without mirror-parity symmetry, apply different Galactic masks, and study\nthe dependence of the results on arbitrary choices of free parameters. We\nconfirm that the data exhibit evidence for odd mirror-parity at a significance\nwhich reaches as high as ~ 99 per cent C.L., under some circumstances. However,\ngiven the inherent biases in the pixel-based statistic and the dependence of\nboth pixel and harmonic space statistics on the particular form of Galactic\nmasking and other a-posteriori choices, we conclude that these results are not\nin significant tension with the predictions of the concordance cosmological\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Mar 2014 21:15:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 2014 12:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-20"}

The construction is focused on\nbinary codes for BI-AWGN channels. As with the Raptor codes, additional parity\nbits are produced by exclusive-OR operations on the precoded bits, providing\nextensive rate compatibility. Unlike Raptor codes, the structure of each\nadditional parity bit in the protograph is explicitly designed through density\nevolution. The construction method provides low iterative decoding thresholds\nand the lifted codes result in excellent error rate performance for\nlong-blocklength PBRL codes. For short-blocklength PBRL codes the protograph\ndesign and lifting must avoid undesired graphical structures such as trapping\nsets and absorbing sets while also seeking to minimize the density evolution\nthreshold. Simulation results are shown in information block sizes of $k=192$,\n$16368$ and $16384$. Comparing at the same information block size of $k=16368$\nbits, the PBRL codes outperform the best known standardized code, the AR4JA\ncodes in the waterfall region.

Observations have\nindicated that the activity of the supermassive black hole located at the\nGalactic center, Sgr A*, was much stronger than the present time. Specifically,\none possibility is that while Sgr A* was also in the hot accretion regime, the\naccretion rate should be $10^3-10^4$ times higher during the past $\\sim 10^7$\nyr. On the other hand, recent MHD numerical simulations of hot accretion flows\nhave unambiguously shown the existence of strong winds and obtained their\nproperties.

In this study we use a shallow-water model to\ninvestigate the global atmospheric dynamics in the stratified layer overlying\nthe convective zone on these rapidly rotating objects. We show that the\nexistence and properties of the atmospheric circulation crucially depend on key\nparameters including the energy injection rate and radiative timescale. Under\nconditions of strong internal heat flux and weak radiative dissipation, a\nbanded flow pattern comprising east-west jet streams spontaneously emerges from\nthe interaction of atmospheric turbulence with the planetary rotation. In\ncontrast, when the internal heat flux is weak and/or radiative dissipation is\nstrong, turbulence injected into the atmosphere damps before it can\nself-organize into jets, leading to a flow dominated by transient eddies and\nisotropic turbulence instead. The simulation results are not very sensitive to\nthe form of the forcing. Based on the location of the transition between\njet-dominated and eddy-dominated regimes, we suggest that many brown dwarfs may\nexhibit atmospheric circulations dominated by eddies and turbulence (rather\nthan jets) due to the strong radiative damping on these worlds, but a jet\nstructure is also possible under some realistic conditions. Our simulated light\ncurves capture important features from observed infrared lightcurves of brown\ndwarfs, including amplitude variations of a few percent and shapes that\nfluctuate between single-peak and multi-peak structures. More broadly, our work\nshows that the shallow-water system provides a useful tool to illuminate\nfundamental aspects of the dynamics on these worlds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 06:48:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 May 2014 22:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

By carefully\nbalancing the cell composition and suppressing the initial irreversible\ncapacity of the anode, we demonstrate an optimal battery performance in terms\nof specific capacity, i.e. 165 mAhg-1, estimated energy density of about 190\nWhkg-1 and life, with a stable operation for over 80 charge-discharge cycles.\nWe link these unique properties to the graphene nanoflake anode displaying\ncrystalline order and high uptake of lithium at the edges, as well as to its\nstructural and morphological optimization in relation to the overall battery\ncomposition. Our approach, compatible with any printing technologies, is cheap\nand scalable and opens up new opportunities for the development of\nhigh-capacity Li-ion batteries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 08:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

New modeling of CO1-0 and CO2-1 imaging\nobservations leads to a revised characterization of RS Cnc's previously\nidentified axisymmetric molecular outflow. Rather than a simple disk-outflow\npicture, we find that a gradient in velocity as a function of latitude is\nneeded to fit the spatially resolved spectra, and in our preferred model, the\ndensity and the velocity vary smoothly from the equatorial plane to the polar\naxis. In terms of density, the source appears quasi-spherical, whereas in terms\nof velocity the source is axi-symmetric with a low expansion velocity in the\nequatorial plane and faster outflows in the polar directions. The flux of\nmatter is also larger in the polar directions than in the equatorial plane. An\nimplication of our model is that the stellar wind is still accelerated at radii\nlarger than a few hundred AU, well beyond the radius where the terminal\nvelocity is thought to be reached in an asymptotic giant branch star. The HI\ndata show the previously detected head-tail morphology, but also supply\nadditional detail about the atomic gas distribution and kinematics. We confirm\nthat the `head' seen in HI is elongated in a direction consistent with the\npolar axis of the molecular outflow, suggesting that we are tracing an\nextension of the molecular outflow well beyond the molecular dissociation\nradius (up to ~0.05 pc). The 6'-long HI `tail' is oriented at a PA of\n305{\\deg}, consistent with the space motion of the star.

Thus the new data deepen the mystery of the mismatch between\nPlanck and local H0 measurements, and cannot univocally determine wether it is\nan effect localised at a particular redshift. Having said this, we find that\nassuming the NGC4258 maser distance as the correct anchor for H0, brings the\nodds to comfortable values.\n  Further, using only the expansion history measurements we constrain, within\nthe LCDM model, H0 = 68.5 +- 3.5 and Omega_m = 0.32 +- 0.05 without relying on\nany CMB prior. We also address the question of how smooth the expansion history\nof the universe is given the cosmology independent data and conclude that there\nis no evidence for deviations from smoothness on the expansion history, neither\nvariations with time in the value of the equation of state of dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 09:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

The\ngrowth rate $\\delta$ is a continuously tunable parameter of the problem which\nassumes a specific value while a particular pattern of discs is generated. When\na growing disc overlaps for the first time with at least another disc, it's\ngrowth is stopped and is said to be `frozen'. In this paper we study the\npercolation properties of the set of frozen discs. Using numerical simulations\nwe present evidence for the following: (i) The Order Parameter appears to jump\ndiscontinuously at a certain critical value of the area coverage; (ii) the\nwidth of the window of the area coverage needed to observe a macroscopic jump\nin the Order Parameter tends to vanish as $\\delta \\to 0$ and on the contrary\n(iii) the cluster size distribution has a power law decaying functional form.\nWhile the first two results are the signatures of a discontinuous transition,\nthe third result is indicative of a continuous transition. Therefore we refer\nthis transition as a sharp but continuous transition similar to what has been\nobserved in the recently introduced Achlioptas process of Explosive\nPercolation. It is also observed that in the limit of $\\delta \\to 0$, the\ncritical area coverage at the transition point tends to unity, implying the\nlimiting pattern is space-filling. In this limit, the fractal dimension of the\npore space at the percolation point has been estimated to be $1.42(10)$ and the\ncontact network of the disc assembly is found to be a scale-free network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 09:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-11"}

Considering the characteristics of coupled\nlibrational and orbital motions, an averaging method is introduced to deal with\nthe slow-fast system equation, thus a definite equivalent model is derived. The\ngeneral orbit motion is completely determined analytically, including the orbit\ngeometry, periodicity, conversations and moving region etc. Since the\npossibility of orbit control using tether reaction has been proved by previous\nstudies, special attention is paid to the transportation mode of angular\nmomentum and mechanical energy between the orbit and libration. The effect of\ntether length change on the orbit shape is verified both in the averaged model\nand original model. The results show the orbit angular momentum and mechanical\nenergy can be controlled independently, and the operating principles of tether\nreactions are derived for special modification of orbit shape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 11:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-11"}

This general\nsolution for sigma(y) is determined by the Einstein-Hilbert's equations up to a\nconstant, that results in physically diverse schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 13:40:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 15:14:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 14:38:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 07:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-15"}

Kepler observations revealed a brown dwarf eclipsing the M-type star\nLHS 6343 A with a period of 12.71 days. In addition, an out-of-eclipse light\nmodulation with the same period and a relative semi-amplitude of 2 x 10^-4 was\nobserved showing an almost constant phase lag to the eclipses produced by the\nbrown dwarf. In a previous work, we concluded that this was due to the light\nmodulation induced by photospheric active regions in LHS 6343 A. Aims. In the\npresent work, we prove that most of the out-of-eclipse light modulation is\ncaused by the Doppler-beaming induced by the orbital motion of the primary\nstar. Methods. We introduce a model of the Doppler-beaming for an eccentric\norbit and also considered the ellipsoidal effect. The data were fitted using a\nBayesian approach implemented through a Monte Carlo Markov chain method. Model\nresiduals were analysed by searching for periodicities using a Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram. Results. For the first seven quarters of Kepler observations and\nthe orbit previously derived from the radial velocity measurements, we show\nthat the light modulation of the system outside eclipses is dominated by the\nDoppler-beaming effect. A period search performed on the residuals shows a\nsignificant periodicity of 42.5 +- 3.2 days with a false-alarm probability of 5\nx 10^-4, probably associated with the rotational modulation of the primary\ncomponent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 13:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The dispersions have been therefore interpreted as\nextragalactic, leading to the inference that the sources of the bursts are at\nGpc distances. This then implies that the bursts are extremely energetic\nevents, originating from quite small volumes (due to the millisecond burst\ndurations). To circumvent the energetic difficulties, Loeb, Shvartzvald, & Maoz\n(2014) propose that the bursts are produced by flares near the surfaces of M\nstars or contact binaries within a local volume of the galaxy. Most of the\ndispersion would then occur in the overlying stellar coronae. With the\ndispersion concentrated in a relatively high density region, the quadratic\ndispersion approximation breaks down as the plasma frequency is comparable to\n(although less than) the propagation frequency. The observed dispersion curves\nare closely quadratic, however, consistent with a low density medium, ruling\nout this model. Because any model invoking local galactic sources would require\na concentrated high density dispersing medium, it appears highly likely that\nthe dispersions occur in the intergalactic medium. This medium, probably\ncontaining most of the baryon content of the universe, is expected to be highly\nstructured on large scales. Hot gas within clusters and especially groups of\ngalaxies may contribute significantly to the observed dispersion. Optical and\nX-ray observations, including redshifts and combined with cosmological\ndispersion measures, can probe the distribution of the IGM and determine how\nmuch of it lies outside the X-ray luminous concentrations seen in clusters and\ngroups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 15:20:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Rev. A, 84, 022302 (2011)]. We find that when\ninitially pure W states are under decoherence, i) DPC: as decoherence starts\nand increases, QFI smoothly decays; ii) ADC: just as decoherence starts, QFI\nexhibits a sudden drop to the shot noise level and as decoherence increases,\nQFI continues to decrease to zero and then increases back to the shot noise\nlevel; iii) PDC: just as decoherence starts, a sudden death of QFI occurs and\nQFI remains zero for any rate of decoherence, therefore W states in phase\ndamping channel do not provide phase sensitivity. We also find that, on the\ncontrary to GHZ states, pure or decohered W states are not sensitive with\nrespect to rotations in z direction and the sensitivities with respect to\nrotations in x and y directions are equal to each other, implying no sudden\nchange points of QFI due to competition between directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 08:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}
