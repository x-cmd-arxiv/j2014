In order to\ndetermine the genetic blueprint of an organism, sequencing platforms typically\nemploy so-called shotgun sequencing strategy to oversample the target genome\nwith a library of relatively short overlapping reads. The order of nucleotides\nin the reads is determined by processing the acquired noisy signals generated\nby the sequencing instrument. Assembly of a genome from potentially erroneous\nshort reads is a computationally daunting task even in the scenario where a\nreference genome exists. Errors and gaps in the reference, and perfect repeat\nregions in the target, further render the assembly challenging and cause\ninaccuracies. In this paper, we formulate the reference-guided sequence\nassembly problem as the inference of the genome sequence on a bipartite graph\nand solve it using a message-passing algorithm. The proposed algorithm can be\ninterpreted as the well-known classical belief propagation scheme under a\ncertain prior. Unlike existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed algorithm\ncombines the information provided by the reads without needing to know\nreliability of the short reads (so-called quality scores). Relation of the\nmessage-passing algorithm to a provably convergent power iteration scheme is\ndiscussed. To evaluate and benchmark the performance of the proposed technique,\nwe find an analytical expression for the probability of error of a genie-aided\nmaximum a posteriori (MAP) decision scheme. Results on both simulated and\nexperimental data demonstrate that the proposed message-passing algorithm\noutperforms commonly used state-of-the-art tools, and it nearly achieves the\nperformance of the aforementioned MAP decision scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Mar 2014 16:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

This model was introduced and studied in [LeJ12] and\n[LL12]. It is a model with long range correlations with two parameters $\\alpha$\nand $\\kappa$. The non-negative parameter $\\alpha$ measures the amount of loops,\nand $\\kappa$ plays the role of killing on vertices penalizing ($\\kappa>0$) or\nfavoring ($\\kappa<0$) appearance of large loops. It was shown in [LL12] that\nfor any fixed $\\kappa$ and large enough $\\alpha$, there exists an infinite\ncluster in the loop percolation on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$. In the present article, we\nshow a non-trivial phase transition on the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^d$\n($d\\geq 3$) for $\\kappa=0$.

These rates are comparable with the ones\nobtained from a single large loop and only depend on the dimension. For $d=3$\nor $4$, we give better lower bounds on the decay of the probability of one-arm\nevent, which show importance of small loops for long connections.

The collection of \"qualified\" subsets is defined by a Boolean function.\n  It has been a major open problem to understand which (monotone) functions can\nbe realized by a computational secret-sharing schemes. Yao suggested a method\nfor secret-sharing for any function that has a polynomial-size monotone circuit\n(a class which is strictly smaller than the class of monotone functions in P).\nAround 1990 Rudich raised the possibility of obtaining secret-sharing for all\nmonotone functions in NP: In order to reconstruct the secret a set of parties\nmust be \"qualified\" and provide a witness attesting to this fact.\n  Recently, Garg et al. (STOC 2013) put forward the concept of witness\nencryption, where the goal is to encrypt a message relative to a statement \"x\nin L\" for a language L in NP such that anyone holding a witness to the\nstatement can decrypt the message, however, if x is not in L, then it is\ncomputationally hard to decrypt. Garg et al. showed how to construct several\ncryptographic primitives from witness encryption and gave a candidate\nconstruction.\n  One can show that computational secret-sharing implies witness encryption for\nthe same language. Our main result is the converse: we give a construction of a\ncomputational secret-sharing scheme for any monotone function in NP assuming\nwitness encryption for NP and one-way functions. As a consequence we get a\ncompleteness theorem for secret-sharing: computational secret-sharing scheme\nfor any single monotone NP-complete function implies a computational\nsecret-sharing scheme for every monotone function in NP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Mar 2014 19:11:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jun 2014 19:06:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 31 May 2015 20:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-02"}

The coupling of Stokes and Biot equations represents a\nprototype problem for these phenomena, which feature multiple facets. On one\nhand it shares common traits with fluid-structure interaction. On the other\nhand it resembles the Stokes-Darcy coupling. For these reasons, the numerical\nsimulation of the Stokes-Biot coupled system is a challenging task. The need of\nlarge memory storage and the difficulty to characterize appropriate solvers and\nrelated preconditioners are typical shortcomings of classical discretization\nmethods applied to this problem. The application of loosely coupled time\nadvancing schemes mitigates these issues because it allows to solve each\nequation of the system independently with respect to the others. In this work\nwe develop and thoroughly analyze a loosely coupled scheme for Stokes-Biot\nequations. The scheme is based on Nitsche's method for enforcing interface\nconditions. Once the interface operators corresponding to the interface\nconditions have been defined, time lagging allows us to build up a loosely\ncoupled scheme with good stability properties. The stability of the scheme is\nguaranteed provided that appropriate stabilization operators are introduced\ninto the variational formulation of each subproblem. The error of the resulting\nmethod is also analyzed, showing that splitting the equations pollutes the\noptimal approximation properties of the underlying discretization schemes. In\norder to restore good approximation properties, while maintaining the\ncomputational efficiency of the loosely coupled approach, we consider the\napplication of the loosely coupled scheme as a preconditioner for the\nmonolithic approach. Both theoretical insight and numerical results confirm\nthat this is a promising way to develop efficient solvers for the problem at\nhand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Mar 2014 22:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-25"}

When the number of steps for calculating an\nassumption tends to infinity, probability theory can be applied to predict\nwhether the assumption holds or not. This characteristic is related to the\nnumber of steps for verifying arbitrarily large prime numbers. This study\nproved that $\\pi (n)-Li(n)=o(M(n)\\sqrt{Li(n)})$ almost certainly holds without\nany assumptions. Here, $\\pi (n)$ is the number of primes not greater than $n$,\n$Li(n)$ is a logarithmic integral function, and $M(n)$ is an arbitrary function\nsuch that $M(n)\\rightarrow\\infty$. This result implies that the Riemann\nhypothesis holds as the falseness of the Riemann hypothesis leads to a\ncontradiction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Mar 2014 06:12:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Apr 2014 11:34:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2014 14:56:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 12:42:32 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 10 May 2014 12:49:20 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 00:19:00 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 30 Sep 2018 11:50:50 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 06:05:26 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 23:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-27"}
