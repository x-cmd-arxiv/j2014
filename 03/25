In the one-dimensional case,\ncomputing the probability for a given mean and variance simply requires the\nevaluation of the corresponding Gaussian density. In the $n$-dimensional\nsetting, however, it requires the inversion of an $n \\times n$ covariance\nmatrix, $C$, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, $\\det(C)$. In many\ncases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of\nthe form $C = \\sigma^2 I + K$, where $K$ is computed using a specified\ncovariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters\n(hyperparameters). The matrix $C$ is typically dense, causing standard direct\nmethods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require $\\mathcal O(n^3)$\nwork. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling. Here, we show that for\nthe most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix $C$ can be\nhierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of the\nidentity matrix, yielding an $\\mathcal O (n\\log^2 n) $ algorithm for inversion.\nMore importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of the\ndeterminant $\\det(C)$, permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in\nhigh dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining $K$. Our\nfast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of\nhyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combination\nof nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performance\ncomputing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractable\nproblems. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on standard covariance\nkernels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 16:02:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2015 16:39:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-07"}

We aim to study the magnetohydrodynamic oscillations of longitudinally\ninhomogeneous prominence threads and to shed light on the problem of frequency\nratio. Classical Sturm--Liouville problem is used for the threads with\nlongitudinally inhomogeneous plasma density. We show that the spatial variation\nof total pressure perturbations along the thread is governed by the stationary\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation, where the longitudinal inhomogeneity of plasma\ndensity stands for the potential energy. Consequently, the equation has bounded\nsolutions in terms of Hermite polynomials. Boundary conditions at the thread\nsurface lead to transcendental dispersion equation with Bessel functions. Thin\nflux tube approximation of the dispersion equation shows that the frequency of\nkink waves is proportional to the expression \\alpha(2n+1), where \\alpha is the\ndensity inhomogeneity parameter and n is the longitudinal mode number.\nConsequently, the ratio of the frequencies of second and first harmonics tends\nto 3 in prominence threads. Numerical solution of the dispersion equation shows\nthat the ratio only slightly decreases for thicker tubes in the case of smaller\nlongitudinal inhomogeneity of external density, therefore the thin flux tube\nlimit is a good approximation for prominence oscillations. However, stronger\nlongitudinal inhomogeneity of external density may lead to the significant\nshift of frequency ratio for wider tubes and therefore the thin tube\napproximation may fail. The tendency of frequency ratio of second and first\nharmonics towards 3 in prominence threads is explained by the analogy of the\noscillations with quantum harmonic oscillator, where the density inhomogeneity\nof the threads plays a role of potential energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 16:26:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

We show that computing this metric is\nNP-hard. In addition, we show that any algorithm that approximates the distance\nwithin a certain absolute error, depending on the size of the SMMs, is NP-hard.\nNevertheless, we introduce an alternative distance, based on the Kantorovich\nmetric, that is an over-approximation of the former and we show that, under\nmild assumptions on the residence time distributions, it can be computed in\npolynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 16:40:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 15:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-26"}

The inference\nproblem, to determine the probability of query answers in PLP, is intractable\nin general, thereby motivating the need for approximate techniques. In this\npaper, we present a technique for approximate inference of conditional\nprobabilities for PLP queries. It is an Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) technique, where the distribution from which samples are drawn is\nmodified as the Markov Chain is explored. In particular, the distribution is\nprogressively modified to increase the likelihood that a generated sample is\nconsistent with evidence. In our context, each sample is uniquely characterized\nby the outcomes of a set of random variables. Inspired by reinforcement\nlearning, our technique propagates rewards to random variable/outcome pairs\nused in a sample based on whether the sample was consistent or not. The\ncumulative rewards of each outcome is used to derive a new \"adapted\ndistribution\" for each random variable. For a sequence of samples, the\ndistributions are progressively adapted after each sample. For a query with\n\"Markovian evaluation structure\", we show that the adapted distribution of\nsamples converges to the query's conditional probability distribution. For\nMarkovian queries, we present a modified adaptation process that can be used in\nadaptive MCMC as well as adaptive independent sampling.

Now let K be an arbitrary field of characteristic p>0 and let G be a\nfinite p-group. In this paper we study the category Ts of all finitely\ngenerated trace-surjective K-G algebras. In a previous paper we have shown that\nthe objects in Ts are precisely those finitely generated K-G algebras A such\nthat the extension of A over the invariant ring A^G is a Galois-extension in\nthe sense of Chase-Harrison-Rosenberg.

Canonical post-asymptotic\ngiant branch evolution suggests a relatively high mass while previous analyses\nindicate a low-mass star. Fitting line profiles from static and expanding\nnon-LTE model atmospheres to the observed UV and optical spectra, taken during\n1988-2013, allowed us to study the temporal change of effective temperature,\nsurface gravity, mass-loss rate, and terminal wind velocity. In addition, we\ndetermined the chemical composition of the atmosphere. We find that the central\nstar has steadily increased its effective temperature from 38kK in 1988 to a\npeak value of 60kK in 2002. During the same time, the star was contracting, as\nconcluded from an increase in surface gravity from log g = 4.8 to 6.0 and a\ndrop in luminosity. Simultaneously, the mass-loss rate declined from log\n(dM/dt/Msun/yr)=-9.0 to -11.6 and the terminal wind velocity increased from\n1800km/s to 2800km/s. Since around 2002, the star stopped heating and has\ncooled down again to 55kK by 2006. It has a largely solar surface composition\nwith the exception of slightly subsolar carbon, phosphorus, and sulfur. By\ncomparison with stellar-evolution calculations, we confirm that SAO244567 must\nbe a low-mass star (M < 0.55 Msun). However, the slow evolution of the\nrespective stellar evolutionary models is in strong contrast to the observed\nfast evolution and the young planetary nebula with a kinematical age of only\nabout 1000 years. We speculate that the star could be a late He-shell flash\nobject. Alternatively, it could be the outcome of close-binary evolution. Then\nSAO244567 would be a low-mass (0.354 Msun) helium prewhite dwarf after the\ncommon-envelope phase, during which the planetary nebula was ejected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 17:45:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

We have discovered [Ne III]{\\lambda}3869 emission from the\nmicrojets of Sz 102, a low-mass young star in Lupus III. Spectroastrometric\nanalyses of two-dimensional [Ne III] spectra obtained from archival\nhigh-dispersion ($R\\approx 33,000$) Very Large Telescope/UVES data suggest that\nthe emission consists of two velocity components spatially separated by ~ 0.\"3,\nor a projected distance of ~ 60 AU. The stronger redshifted component is\ncentered at ~ +21 km/s with a line width of ~ 140 km/s, and the weaker\nblueshifted component at ~ -90 km/s with a line width of ~ 190 km/s. The two\ncomponents trace velocity centroids of the known microjets and show large line\nwidths that extend across the systemic velocity, suggesting their potential\norigins in wide-angle winds that may eventually collimate into jets. Optical\nline ratios indicate that the microjets are hot ($T\\lesssim1.6\\times10^4$ K)\nand ionized ($n_e\\gtrsim5.7\\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$). The blueshifted component\nhas ~ 13% higher temperature and ~ 46% higher electron density than the\nredshifted counterpart, forming a system of asymmetric pair of jets. The\ndetection of the [Ne III]{\\lambda}3869 line with the distinct velocity profile\nsuggests that the emission originates in flows that may have been strongly\nionized by deeply embedded hard X-ray sources, most likely generated by\nmagnetic processes. The discovery of [Ne III]{\\lambda}3869 emission along with\nother optical forbidden lines from Sz 102 support the picture of wide-angle\nwinds surrounding magnetic loops in the close vicinity of the young star.\nFuture high sensitivity X-ray imaging and high angular-resolution optical\nspectroscopy may help confirm the picture proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 18:19:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Apr 2014 09:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-24"}

Several methods have been\nproposed in the literature that estimate one canonical vector in the two-group\ncase. However, $G-1$ canonical vectors can be considered if the number of\ngroups is $G$. In the multi-group context, it is common to estimate canonical\nvectors in a sequential fashion. Moreover, separate prior estimation of the\ncovariance structure is often required. We propose a novel methodology for\ndirect estimation of canonical vectors. In contrast to existing techniques, the\nproposed method estimates all canonical vectors at once, performs variable\nselection across all the vectors and comes with theoretical guarantees on the\nvariable selection and classification consistency. First, we highlight the fact\nthat in the $N>p$ setting the canonical vectors can be expressed in a closed\nform up to an orthogonal transformation. Secondly, we propose an extension of\nthis form to the $p\\gg N$ setting and achieve feature selection by using a\ngroup penalty.

Three of its main properties are that\nit is non-negative for any tripartite state, that it decreases under local\noperations applied to systems $A$ and $B$, and that it obeys the duality\nrelation $I(A;B|C)=I(A;B|D)$ for a four-party pure state on systems $ABCD$. The\nconditional mutual information also underlies the squashed entanglement, an\nentanglement measure that satisfies all of the axioms desired for an\nentanglement measure. As such, it has been an open question to find R\\'enyi\ngeneralizations of the conditional mutual information, that would allow for a\ndeeper understanding of the original quantity and find applications beyond the\ntraditional memoryless setting of quantum information theory. The present paper\naddresses this question, by defining different $\\alpha$-R\\'enyi generalizations\n$I_{\\alpha}(A;B|C)$ of the conditional mutual information, some of which we can\nprove converge to the conditional mutual information in the limit\n$\\alpha\\rightarrow1$.

The quantities defined here should find applications in quantum\ninformation theory and perhaps even in other areas of physics, but we leave\nthis for future work.

Recent discoveries, enabled by sophisticated\nfabrication, have uncovered new phenomena that completely change our\nunderstanding of transport in these devices, especially the role of the spin\nand valley degrees of freedom. This review describes the modern understanding\nof transport through nanotube devices.\n  Unlike conventional semiconductors, electrons in nanotubes have two angular\nmomentum quantum numbers, arising from spin and from valley freedom. We focus\non the interplay between the two. In single quantum dots defined in short\nlengths of nanotube, the energy levels associated with each degree of freedom,\nand the spin-orbit coupling between them, are revealed by Coulomb blockade\nspectroscopy. In double quantum dots, the combination of quantum numbers\nmodifies the selection rules of Pauli blockade. This can be exploited to read\nout spin and valley qubits, and to measure the decay of these states through\ncoupling to nuclear spins and phonons. A second unique property of carbon\nnanotubes is that the combination of valley freedom and electron-electron\ninteractions in one dimension strongly modifies their transport behaviour.\nInteraction between electrons inside and outside a quantum dot is manifested in\nSU(4) Kondo behavior and level renormalization. Interaction within a dot leads\nto Wigner molecules and more complex correlated states.\n  This review takes an experimental perspective informed by recent advances in\ntheory. As well as the well-understood overall picture, we also state clearly\nopen questions for the field. These advances position nanotubes as a leading\nsystem for the study of spin and valley physics in one dimension where\nelectronic disorder and hyperfine interaction can both be reduced to a very low\nlevel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 19:52:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2015 09:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-04"}

The\nmixing-length scale is taken to be proportional to the local pressure scale\nheight, and the proportionality factor (the mixing-length parameter) must be\ndetermined by comparing the stellar models to some calibrator, usually the Sun.\nNo strong arguments exist to suggest that the mixing-length parameter is the\nsame in all stars and at all evolutionary phases. The aim of this study is to\npresent a new theory of stellar convection that does not require the mixing\nlength parameter. We present a self-consistent analytical formulation of\nstellar convection that determines the properties of stellar convection as a\nfunction of the physical behaviour of the convective elements themselves and of\nthe surrounding medium. This new theory is formulated starting from a\nconventional solution of the Navier-Stokes/Euler equations, i.e. the Bernoulli\nequation for a perfect fluid, but expressed in a non-inertial reference frame\nco-moving with the convective elements. In our formalism the motion of stellar\nconvective cells inside convectively-unstable layers is fully determined by a\nnew system of equations for convection in a non-local and time-dependent\nformalism. We obtain an analytical, non-local, time-dependent sub-sonic\nsolution for the convective energy transport that does not depend on any free\nparameter. The theory is suitable for the outer convective zones of solar type\nstars and stars of all mass on the main sequence band.

The transfer equation is solved in the mixed frame,\nincluding velocity dependent source terms accurate to O(v/c). An operator split\napproach is used to compute the specific intensity along discrete rays, with\nupwind monotonic interpolation used along each ray to update the transport\nterms, and implicit methods used to compute the scattering and absorption\nsource terms. Conservative differencing is used for the transport terms, which\nensures the specific intensity (as well as energy and momentum) are conserved\nalong each ray to round-off error. The use of implicit methods for the source\nterms ensures the method is stable even if the source terms are very stiff. To\ncouple the solution of the transfer equation to the MHD algorithms in the\nAthena code, we perform direct quadrature of the specific intensity over angles\nto compute the energy and momentum source terms. We present the results of a\nvariety of tests of the method, such as calculating the structure of a non-LTE\natmosphere, an advective diffusion test, linear wave convergence tests, and the\nwell-known shadow test. We use new semi-analytic solutions for radiation\nmodified shocks to demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to capture the\neffects of an anisotropic radiation field accurately. Since the method uses\nexplicit differencing of the spatial operators, it shows excellent weak scaling\non parallel computers.

We consider a one-dimensional plane-parallel slab of gas irradiated\nby the interstellar radiation field, either at constant density and temperature\nor in thermal and pressure equilibrium. The dominant thermal processes tend to\nform three distinct regions in the clouds. At low column densities cooling is\ndominated by ionised metals such as SiII, FeII, FeIII and CII, which are\nbalanced by photoheating, primarily from HI. Once the hydrogen-ionising\nradiation becomes attenuated by neutral hydrogen, photoelectric dust heating\ndominates, while CII becomes dominant for cooling. Finally, dust shielding\ntriggers the formation of CO and suppresses photoelectric heating. The dominant\ncoolants in this fully shielded region are H2 and CO. The column density of the\nHI-H2 transition predicted by our model is lower at higher density (or at\nhigher pressure for gas clouds in pressure equilibrium) and at higher\nmetallicity, in agreement with previous PDR models. We also compare the HI-H2\ntransition in our model to two prescriptions for molecular hydrogen formation\nthat have been implemented in hydrodynamic simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 21:09:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 May 2014 09:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

One part of thermodynamics defines\nentropy for equilibrium systems and demands an ever-increasing entropy for\nnon-equilibrium ones. However, starting with the work of Ludwig Boltzmann in\n1872, and continuing to the present day, various models of non-equilibrium\nbehavior have been put together with the specific aim of generalizing the\nconcept of entropy to non-equilibrium situations. This kind of entropy has been\ntermed {\\em kinetic entropy} to distinguish it from the thermodynamic variety.\nKnowledge of kinetic entropy started from Boltzmann's insight about his\nequation for the time dependence of gaseous systems. In this paper, his result\nis stated as a definition of kinetic entropy in terms of a local equation for\nthe entropy density. This definition is then applied to Landau's theory of the\nFermi liquid thereby giving the kinetic entropy within that theory.\n  Entropy has been defined and used for a wide variety of situations in which a\ncondensed matter system has been allowed to relax for a sufficient period so\nthat the very most rapid fluctuations have been ironed out. One of the broadest\napplications of non-equilibrium analysis considers quantum degenerate systems\nusing Martin-Schwinger Green's functions\\cite{MS} as generalized of Wigner\nfunctions, $g^<$ and $g^>$. This paper describes once again these how the\nquantum kinetic equations for these functions give locally defined conservation\nlaws for mass momentum and energy. In local thermodynamic equilibrium, this\nkinetic theory enables a reasonable local definition of entropy density.\nHowever, when the system is outside of local equilibrium, this definition\nfails. It is speculated that quantum entanglement is the source of this\nfailure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 21:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-26"}

A\ncharged or massive particle moving in a curved background space-time produces a\nfield that affects its motion, pushing it off its expected geodesic. This\nself-field gives rise to a so-called self-force acting on the particle. In\nmodelling this motion, the self-force approach uses a perturbative expansion in\nthe mass ratio. One of the most interesting sources of gravitational waves are\nextreme mass ratio inspirals - systems perfectly suited to self-force\nmodelling. One of the key problems within the self-force model is the\ndivergence of the field at the particle. To resolve this, the field is split\ninto a singular component and a smooth regular field. This regular-singular\nsplit, introduced by Detweiler and Whiting, is used in most modern self-force\ncalculations. In this thesis, we derive high-order expansions of the\nDetweiler-Whiting singular field, and use these to push the boundaries on\ncurrent precision limits of self-force calculations. Within the mode-sum\nscheme, we give over 14 previously unknown regularisation parameters, almost\ndoubling the current regularisation parameter database. We also produce smooth\neffective sources to high order, and propose an application of the higher terms\nto improve accuracy in the m-mode scheme. Finally, we investigate the status of\nthe cosmic censorship conjecture and the role that the self-force plays. To\nthis end, we give regularisation parameters for non-geodesic motion. We also\nshow the necessity of our results in the exciting area of second order\nself-force calculations, which benefit significantly from high-order coordinate\nexpansions of the singular field. We calculate several parameters that these\nschemes require, and highlight the further advancements possible from the\nresults of this thesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 22:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-26"}

This is explained by\nconsidering the effect on charge-carrier diffusion due to the reduction in the\nmagnitude of the channel potential as collected signal charge acts to partially\nneutralize the fixed charge in the depleted channel. The resulting reduced\nvoltage drop across the carrier drift region decreases the vertical electric\nfield and increases the carrier transit time.

We consider the age of the\nrecords, i.e. the time up to which a record survives. Depending on how the age\nof the current last record is defined, we propose three distinct sequences of\nages (indexed by $\\alpha$ = I, II, III) associated to a given sequence of\nrecords. We then focus on the longest lasting record, which is the longest\nelement among this sequence of ages. To characterize the statistics of these\nlongest lasting records, we compute: (i) the probability that the record of the\nlongest age is broken at step $n$, denoted by $Q^{\\alpha}(n)$, which we call\nthe probability of record breaking and: (ii) the duration of the longest\nlasting record, $\\ell_{\\max}^{\\alpha}(n)$. We show that both $Q^{\\alpha}(n)$\nand the full statistics of $\\ell_{\\max}^{\\alpha}(n)$ are universal, i.e.\nindependent of the jump distribution $p(\\eta)$. We compute exactly the large\n$n$ asymptotic behaviors of $Q^{\\alpha}(n)$ as well as $\\langle\n\\ell_{\\max}^{\\alpha}(n)\\rangle$ (when it exists) and show that each case gives\nrise to a different universal constant associated to random walks (including\nL\\'evy flights).

We used the dust\nradiative transfer code MCFOST and the thermochemical code ProDiMo to derive\nthe disk structure from the simultaneous modeling of the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED), VLT/CRIRES CO P(10) 4.75 micron, Herschel/PACS [O I] 63\nmicron, Spitzer-IRS, and JCMT 12CO J=3-2 spectra, VLTI/PIONIER H-band\nvisibilities, and constraints from (sub-)mm continuum interferometry and\nnear-IR imaging. We found a disk model able to describe the current\nobservations simultaneously. This disk has the following structure. (1) To\nreproduce the SED, the near-IR interferometry data, and the CO ro-vibrational\nemission, refractory grains (we suggest carbon) are present inside the silicate\nsublimation radius (0.08<R<0.2 AU). (2) The dust cavity (R<30 AU) is filled\nwith gas, the surface density of this gas must increase with radius to fit the\nCO P(10) line profile, a small gap of a few AU in the gas is compatible with\ncurrent data, and a large gap in the gas is not likely. (4) The gas/dust ratio\ninside the cavity is > 100 to account for the 870 micron continuum upper limit\nand the CO P(10) line flux. (5) The gas/dust ratio at 30<R<200 AU is < 10 to\nsimultaneously describe the [O I] 63 micron line flux and the CO P(10) line\nprofile. (6) In the outer disk, most of the mass should be located in the\nmidplane, and a significant fraction of the dust is in large grains.\nConclusions: Simultaneous modeling of the gas and dust is required to break the\nmodel degeneracies and constrain the disk structure.

The existing works on SCS usually take the sensing\nmatrix as a key and the resultant security level is not evaluated in depth.\nThey can only be considered as a preliminary exploration on SCS, but a concrete\nand operable encipher model is not given yet. In this paper, we are going to\ninvestigate SCS in a systematic way. The relationship between CS and\nsymmetric-key cipher indicates some possible encryption models. To this end, we\npropose the two-level protection models (TLPM) for SCS which are developed from\nmeasurements taking and something else, respectively. It is believed that these\nmodels will provide a new point of view and stimulate further research in both\nCS and cryptography. Specifically, an efficient and secure encryption scheme\nfor parallel compressive sensing (PCS) is designed by embedding a two-layer\nprotection in PCS using chaos. The first layer is undertaken by random\npermutation on a two-dimensional signal, which is proved to be an acceptable\npermutation with overwhelming probability. The other layer is to sample the\npermuted signal column by column with the same chaotic measurement matrix,\nwhich satisfies the restricted isometry property of PCS with overwhelming\nprobability. Both the random permutation and the measurement matrix are\nconstructed under the control of a chaotic system. Simulation results show that\nunlike the general joint compression and encryption schemes in which encryption\nalways leads to the same or a lower compression ratio, the proposed approach of\nembedding encryption in PCS actually improves the compression performance.\nBesides, the proposed approach possesses high transmission robustness against\nadditive Gaussian white noise and cropping attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 02:47:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-27"}

Rubey's proof is an adaption of jeu de taquin and promotion for\narbitrary fillings of moon polyominoes. In this paper we present a bijective\nproof for this result by considering fillings of almost-moon polyominoes, which\nare moon polyominoes after removing one of the rows. Explicitly, we construct a\nbijection which preserves the size of the largest northeast chains of the\nfillings when two adjacent rows of the polyomino are exchanged. This bijection\nalso preserves the column sum of the fillings. We also present a bijection that\npreserves the size of the largest northeast chains, the row sum and the column\nsum if every row of the fillings has at most one 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 03:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-26"}

We here investigate the possible existence of\nno-hair-like relations among multipole moments for neutron stars and quark\nstars that are independent of their equation of state. We calculate the\nmultipole moments of these stars up to hexadecapole order by constructing\nuniformly-rotating and unmagnetized stellar solutions to the Einstein\nequations. For slowly-rotating stars, we construct stellar solutions to quartic\norder in spin in a slow-rotation expansion, while for rapidly-rotating stars,\nwe solve the Einstein equations numerically with the LORENE and RNS codes. We\nfind that the multipole moments extracted from these numerical solutions are\nconsistent with each other.

Contribution of this paper is twofold: first, we introduce a\ngraph processing framework based on edge partitioning, that is flexible enough\nto be applied to several different graph problems.

However, their relationships have not yet\nbeen fully investigated. In this paper, we find that the spectral graph theory\nunderlies a series of these elementary methods and can unify them into a\ncomplete framework. The methods include PCA, K-means, Laplacian eigenmap (LE),\nratio cut (Rcut), and a new sparse representation method developed by us,\ncalled spectral sparse representation (SSR). Further, extended relations to\nconventional over-complete sparse representations (e.g., method of optimal\ndirections, KSVD), manifold learning (e.g., kernel PCA, multidimensional\nscaling, Isomap, locally linear embedding), and subspace clustering (e.g.,\nsparse subspace clustering, low-rank representation) are incorporated. We show\nthat, under an ideal condition from the spectral graph theory, PCA, K-means,\nLE, and Rcut are unified together. And when the condition is relaxed, the\nunification evolves to SSR, which lies in the intermediate between PCA/LE and\nK-mean/Rcut. An efficient algorithm, NSCrt, is developed to solve the sparse\ncodes of SSR. SSR combines merits of both sides: its sparse codes reduce\ndimensionality of data meanwhile revealing cluster structure. For its inherent\nrelation to cluster analysis, the codes of SSR can be directly used for\nclustering. Scut, a clustering approach derived from SSR reaches the\nstate-of-the-art performance in the spectral clustering family.

In\nthis context, many research works were interested in creating and elaborating\nconfigurable process models.

A rumor spreads when individuals, who are unable decide the\nauthenticity of the information, mistake the rumor as genuine information and\npass it on to their acquaintances. We propose a solution where a set of\nindividuals (based on their degree) in the social network are trained and\nprovided resources to help them distinguish a rumor from genuine information.\nBy formulating an optimization problem we calculate the optimum set of\nindividuals, who must undergo training, and the quality of training that\nminimizes the expected training cost and ensures an upper bound on the size of\nthe rumor outbreak. Our primary contribution is that although the optimization\nproblem turns out to be non convex, we show that the problem is equivalent to\nsolving a set of linear programs. This result also allows us to solve the\nproblem of minimizing the size of rumor outbreak for a given cost budget. The\noptimum solution displays an interesting pattern which can be implemented as a\nheuristic.

Even though wealth data have been collected in various forms for\ncenturies, the origins for the observed wealth-disparity and social inequality\nare not yet fully understood. Especially the impact and connections of human\nbehavior on wealth could so far not be inferred from data. Here we study wealth\ndata from the virtual economy of the massive multiplayer online game (MMOG)\nPardus. This data not only contains every player's wealth at every point in\ntime, but also all actions of every player over a timespan of almost a decade.\nWe find that wealth distributions in the virtual world are very similar to\nthose in western countries. In particular we find an approximate exponential\nfor low wealth and a power-law tail. The Gini index is found to be $g=0.65$,\nwhich is close to the indices of many Western countries. We find that\nwealth-increase rates depend on the time when players entered the game. Players\nthat entered the game early on tend to have remarkably higher wealth-increase\nrates than those who joined later. Studying the players' positions within their\nsocial networks, we find that the local position in the trade network is most\nrelevant for wealth. Wealthy people have high in- and out-degree in the trade\nnetwork, relatively low nearest-neighbor degree and a low clustering\ncoefficient. Wealthy players have many mutual friendships and are socially well\nrespected by others, but spend more time on business than on socializing. We\nfind that players that are not organized within social groups with at least\nthree members are significantly poorer on average. We observe that high\n`political' status and high wealth go hand in hand.

Both reflect different ways of capturing the notion of\nreliable communication via a quantum system while leaking almost no information\nto an eavesdropper; the difference is that the latter imposes an intrinsically\nquantum security criterion whereas the former requires only a weaker, classical\ncondition. The channels for which this separation is most straightforward to\nestablish are the complementary channels of classical-quantum (cq-)channels,\nand hence a subclass of Hadamard channels. We also prove that certain symmetric\nchannels (related to photon number splitting) have positive weak locking\ncapacity in the presence of a vanishingly small pre-shared secret, whereas\ntheir private capacity is zero.\n  These findings are powerful illustrations of the difference between two\napparently natural notions of privacy in quantum systems, relevant also to\nquantum key distribution (QKD): the older, naive one based on accessible\ninformation, contrasting with the new, composable one embracing the quantum\nnature of the eavesdropper's information.\n  Assuming an additivity conjecture for constrained minimum output Renyi\nentropies, the techniques of the first part demonstrate a single-letter formula\nfor the weak locking capacity of complements to cq-channels, coinciding with a\ngeneral upper bound of Guha et al. for these channels.

This approach leads to a spontaneous\nbreaking of the particle-number symmetry and mixing of states with different\nparticle numbers. In order to restore the particle number, various methods have\nbeen employed, which are based on projection approaches before or after\nvariation. Approximate variation-after-projection (VAP) schemes, utilizing the\nLipkin method, have mostly been used within the Lipkin-Nogami prescription.\n  Purpose: Without recurring to the Lipkin-Nogami prescription, and using\ninstead states rotated in the gauge space, we derive the Lipkin method of\nparticle-number restoration up to sixth order and we test the convergence and\naccuracy of the obtained expansion.\n  Methods: We perform self-consistent calculations using the higher-order\nLipkin method to restore the particle-number symmetry in the framework of\nsuperfluid nuclear energy-density functional theory. We also apply the Lipkin\nmethod to a schematic exactly solvable two-level pairing model.\n  Results: Calculations performed in open-shell tin and lead isotopes show that\nthe Lipkin method converges at fourth order and satisfactorily reproduces the\nVAP ground-state energies and energy kernels. Near closed shells, the\nhigher-order Lipkin method cannot be applied because of a non-analytic kink in\nthe ground-state energies in function of the particle number.\n  Conclusions: In open-shell nuclei, the higher-order Lipkin method provides a\ngood approximation to the exact VAP energies. The method is computationally\ninexpensive, making it particularly suitable, for example, for future\noptimizations of the nuclear energy-density functionals and simultaneous\nrestoration of different symmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 14:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-05"}

We consider the axial\nasymmetries of the electron beam caused by the bends that are used to inject\nelectrons into the interaction region and to extract them. A distribution of\nelectron macroparticles is deposited on a discrete grid enclosed in a\nconducting pipe. The electrostatic potential and electric fields are calculated\nusing numerical Poisson solvers. The kicks experienced by the circulating beam\nare estimated by integrating the electric fields over straight trajectories.\nThese kicks are also provided in the form of interpolated analytical symplectic\nmaps for numerical tracking simulations, which are needed to estimate the\neffects of the electron lens imperfections on proton lifetimes, emittance\ngrowth, and dynamic aperture. We outline a general procedure to calculate the\nmagnitude of the transverse proton kicks, which can then be generalized, if\nneeded, to include further refinements such as the space-charge evolution of\nthe electron beam, magnetic fields generated by the electron current, and\nlongitudinal proton dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 14:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-26"}

The dynamics of\ngravito-inertial waves in stellar interiors, both in radiation and in\nconvection zones, is described with a local non-traditional f-plane model.\nTheir couplings with convective turbulent flows is studied in this framework.\nFirst, we find that, in the super-inertial regime in which the wave frequency\nis over twice the rotation frequency, the evanescence of gravito-inertial waves\nin convective regions decreases with decreasing wave frequency. Next, in the\nsub-inertial regime, gravito-inertial waves become purely propagative inertial\nwaves in convection zones. Simultaneously, turbulence in convective regions is\nmodified by rotation. Indeed, the turbulent energy cascade towards small scales\nis slowed down and in the case of rapid rotation, strongly anisotropic\nturbulent flows are obtained that can be understood as complex non-linear\ntriadic interactions of propagative inertial waves. These different behaviours,\ndue to the action of the Coriolis acceleration, strongly modify the wave\ncouplings with turbulent flows. On one hand, turbulence weakly influenced by\nrotation is coupled with evanescent gravito-inertial waves. On the other hand,\nrapidly rotating turbulence is intrinsically and strongly coupled with\nsub-inertial waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 14:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}
