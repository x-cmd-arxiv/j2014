The Collatz problem is thus\nreduced to showing that all positive odd numbers are present in the tree. The\nmain result is the proof of the boundedness of Collatz sequences.

In galaxies, for instance, multiple-star systems are organised in a\nhierarchical system. Then, governmental and company organisations are\nstructured using a hierarchy, while the Internet, which is used on a daily\nbasis, has a space of domain names arranged hierarchically. Since Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) planning portrays information about the world and reasons to\nsolve some of world's problems, Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning has\nbeen introduced almost 40 years ago to represent and deal with hierarchies. Its\nrequirement for rich domain knowledge to characterise the world enables HTN\nplanning to be very useful, but also to perform well. However, the history of\nalmost 40 years obfuscates the current understanding of HTN planning in terms\nof accomplishments, planning models, similarities and differences among\nhierarchical planners, and its current and objective image. On top of these\nissues, attention attracts the ability of hierarchical planning to truly cope\nwith the requirements of applications from the real world. We propose a\nframework-based approach to remedy this situation. First, we provide a basis\nfor defining different formal models of hierarchical planning, and define two\nmodels that comprise a large portion of HTN planners. Second, we provide a set\nof concepts that helps to interpret HTN planners from the aspect of their\nsearch space. Then, we analyse and compare the planners based on a variety of\nproperties organised in five segments, namely domain authoring, expressiveness,\ncompetence, performance and applicability. Furthermore, we select Web service\ncomposition as a real-world and current application, and classify and compare\nthe approaches that employ HTN planning to solve the problem of service\ncomposition. Finally, we conclude with our findings and present directions for\nfuture work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 16:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-31"}

Using a combined\napproach, we analyze the crystal structure of epitaxial LaVO$_3$ thin films\ngrown on (100)-oriented SrTiO$_3$. Transmission electron microscopy study\nreveals that the thin films are epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ and points to\nthe presence of 90$^{\\circ}$ oriented domains. The mapping of the reciprocal\nspace obtained by high resolution X-ray diffraction permits refinement of the\nlattice parameters. We finally deduce that strain accommodation imposes a\nmonoclinic structure onto the LaVO$_3$ film. The reciprocal space maps are\nnumerically processed and the extracted data computed to refine the atomic\npositions, which are compared to those obtained using precession electron\ndiffraction tomography.

In such configuration the\norganic material is optically pumped by an electrically pumped inorganic device\non chip. This engineering solution requires therefore an optimization of the\norganic gain medium under optical pumping. Here, we report a detailed study of\nthe gain features of dye-doped polymer thin films. In particular we introduce\nthe gain efficiency $K$, in order to facilitate comparison between different\nmaterials and experimental conditions. The gain efficiency was measured with\nvarious setups (pump-probe amplification, variable stripe length method, laser\nthresholds) in order to study several factors which modify the actual gain of a\nlayer, namely the confinement factor, the pump polarization, the molecular\nanisotropy, and the re-absorption. For instance, for a 600 nm thick 5 wt\\% DCM\ndoped PMMA layer, the different experimental approaches give a consistent value\n$K\\simeq$ 80 cm.MW$^{-1}$. On the contrary, the usual model predicting the gain\nfrom the characteristics of the material leads to an overestimation by two\norders of magnitude, which raises a serious problem in the design of actual\ndevices. In this context, we demonstrate the feasibility to infer the gain\nefficiency from the laser threshold of well-calibrated devices.

Taking into account the physics of r-mode evolution, we show that only\nsources spinning at frequencies above a few hundred Hertz can be unstable to\nr-modes, and we derive a more stringent universal r-mode spindown limit on\ntheir gravitational wave signal, exploiting the fact that the r-mode saturation\namplitude is insensitive to the structural properties of individual sources. We\nfind that this refined bound limits the gravitational wave strain from\nmillisecond pulsars to values below the detection sensitivity of\nnext-generation detectors. Young sources are therefore a more promising option\nfor the detection of gravitational waves emitted by r-modes and to probe the\ninterior composition of compact stars in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 19:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

By\nviewing these orthonormal patterns as multiple virtual dumb antennas, we\nrandomly vary their weights over time creating artificial channel fluctuations\nthat can perfectly eliminate the undesired impact of LoS interference. Because\nthe proposed scheme uses a single RF chain, it is well suited for compact and\nlow cost mobile terminals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 20:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-01"}

The first hint of detection at VHE was observed by MAGIC on\n2010 May 3, soon after a gamma-ray flare detected by Fermi-LAT that peaked on\nApril 29. The same emission mechanism may therefore be responsible for both the\nHE and VHE emission during the 2010 flaring episodes. Two optical peaks were\ndetected on 2010 April 20 and June 30, close in time but not simultaneous with\nthe two gamma-ray peaks, while no clear connection was observed between the\nX-ray an gamma-ray emission. An increasing flux density was observed in radio\nand mm bands from the beginning of 2009, in accordance with the increasing\ngamma-ray activity observed by Fermi-LAT, and peaking on 2011 January 27 in the\nmm regime (230 GHz). We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 4C\n+21.35 for the two periods of the VHE detection and a quiescent state, using a\none-zone model with the emission coming from a very compact region outside the\nbroad line region. The three SEDs can be fit with a combination of synchrotron\nself-Compton and external Compton emission of seed photons from a dust torus,\nchanging only the electron distribution parameters between the epochs. The fit\nof the optical/UV part of the spectrum for 2010 April 29 seems to favor an\ninner disk radius of <6 gravitational radii, as one would expect from a\nprograde-rotating Kerr black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 20:28:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2014 21:56:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2014 15:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We introduce a model in which service providers,\nwith ISPs being the main example, aim at optimizing the number of customers\nusing their services, while customers aim at choosing service providers with\nlow customer load (high bandwidth per subscriber, for ISPs). Each service\nprovider chooses between a variety of levels of service (latencies, for ISPs),\nand as long as it does not lose customers, aims at minimizing its level of\nservice; the minimum level of service required to satisfy a customer varies\nacross customers. We consider a two-stage competition: in the first stage,\nservice providers select their levels of service; in the second stage,\ncustomers choose between service providers. In the two-stage game, we show that\nthe competition among service providers possesses a unique Nash equilibrium,\nwhich is moreover super-strong; we also show that sequential better-response\ndynamics of service providers reach this equilibrium, with best-response\ndynamics doing so surprisingly fast. If service providers choose their levels\nof service according to this equilibrium, then the unique Nash equilibrium\namong customers in the second phase is a split of the market between the\nservice providers, based on the customers' minimum acceptable quality of\nservice; moreover, each service provider's chosen level of service is the\nlowest acceptable by the entirety of its market slice, seemingly making no\nattempt to attract other customers. Our results show that this prima facie\nmarket allocation (collusive split of the market) arises as the unique and\nhighly robust outcome of noncooperative, even myopic, service-provider\nbehaviour. These results are applicable to a wide variety of scenarios, from\nexplaining phenomena observable in food markets, to shedding a surprising light\non aspects of location theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 20:29:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Feb 2015 14:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-13"}

While differing in the spatial part, most models have the\nsame spin part, which creates a qq* pair coupled to spin triplet, with the\nspins of the initial quarks as spectators. This is a basic assumption of the\n3P0 model, and is well-known to arise also in the flux tube model, starting\nfrom the strong coupling expansion of lattice QCD. In this article the same\nstructure is shown to emerge in the Cornell model, in the dominant\ncontributions of a more general microscopic decay model, and in the\npseudoscalar-meson emission model. A solution is obtained for arbitrary matrix\nelements in these ``non-flip, triplet'' models, expressed as a weighted sum\nover spatial matrix elements. The coefficients in the expansion, which involve\nthe spin degrees of freedom and the associated angular momentum algebra, are\nmodel-independent. Tables of the angular momentum coefficients are presented\nwhich can be used in future calculations, avoiding tedious Clebsch-Gordan sums.\nThe symmetry and orthogonality properties of the coefficients are discussed, as\nwell as their application to transitions involving hybrid mesons and states of\nmixed spin. New selection rules are derived, and existing ones generalised. The\ncoefficients lead to model-independent relations among decay amplitudes and\nwidths which can be tested in experiment and lattice QCD. They can also be used\nto explain how mass shifts in the unquenched quark model do not spoil\nsuccessful predictions of the ordinary (quenched) quark model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 20:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-20"}

The ``central surface\nbrightness -- thickness'' correlation appears only as a consequence of the\ntransparent exponential disc model to describe real galaxy discs.\n  (2) The Photometric Plane appears to have no independent physical sense.\nVarious forms of this plane are merely sophisticated versions of the Kormendy\nrelation or of the self-relation involving the central surface brightness of a\nbulge/elliptical galaxy and the Sersic index n.\n  (3) The Kormendy relation is a physical correlation presumably reflecting the\ndifference in the origin of bright and faint ellipticals and bulges.\n  We present arguments that involve creating artificial samples to prove our\nmain idea.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 22:18:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

One intriguing feature of the higher-level entity after\nsome major transitions is a division of reproductive labor among its\nlower-level units. Although it can have clear benefits once established, it is\nunknown how such reproductive division of labor originates. We consider a\nrecent evolution experiment on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a unique\nplatform to address the issue of reproductive differentiation during an\nevolutionary transition in individuality. In the experiment, independent yeast\nlineages evolved a multicellular \"snowflake-like'' cluster form in response to\ngravity selection. Shortly after the evolution of clusters, the yeast evolved\nhigher rates of cell death. While cell death enables clusters to split apart\nand form new groups, it also reduces their performance in the face of gravity\nselection. To understand the selective value of increased cell death, we create\na mathematical model of the cellular arrangement within snowflake yeast\nclusters. The model reveals that the mechanism of cell death and the geometry\nof the snowflake interact in complex, evolutionarily important ways. We find\nthat the organization of snowflake yeast imposes powerful limitations on the\navailable space for new cell growth. By dying more frequently, cells in\nclusters avoid encountering space limitations, and, paradoxically, reach higher\nnumbers. In addition, selection for particular group sizes can explain the\nincreased rate of apoptosis both in terms of total cell number and total\nnumbers of collectives. Thus, by considering the geometry of a primitive\nmulticellular organism we can gain insight into the initial emergence of\nreproductive division of labor during an evolutionary transition in\nindividuality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 22:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-13"}

Here, we investigate this counterintuitive phenomenon both\nnumerically and analytically to establish the conditions under which the\nunderlying particle-trapping attractors can form. We focus on a two-dimensional\nopen flow composed of a pair of vortices and its specular image, which is a\nsystem we represent as a vortex pair plus a wall along the symmetry line.\nConsidering particles that are much denser than the fluid, we show that two\npoint attractors form in the neighborhood of the vortex pair provided that the\nparticle Stokes number is smaller than a critical value of order unity. In the\nabsence of the wall, the boundaries of the basins of the attracting points are\nsmooth. When the wall is present, the point attractors describe\ncounter-rotating ellipses in this frame, with a period equal to half the period\nof one isolated vortex pair. However, their boundaries are shown to become\nfractal if the distance to the wall is smaller than a critical distance that\nscales with the inverse square root of the Stokes number. This transformation\nis related to the breakdown of a separatrix that gives rise to a heteroclinic\ntangle close to the vortices, which we describe using a Melnikov function. For\nan even smaller distance to the wall, we demonstrate that a second separatrix\nbreaks down and a new heteroclinic tangle forms farther away from the vortices.\nParticles released in the open part of the flow can approach the attractors and\nbe trapped permanently provided that they cross the two separatrices.\nFurthermore, the trapping of heavy particles from the open flow is shown to be\nrobust to the presence of gravity, viscosity, and noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 22:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-01"}

Whilst usually stated as between\nGR and QM, in fact 8/9ths of it is already present at the classical level. Thus\nwe adopt a `top-down' classical and then quantum approach. I consider a local\nresolution to the Problem of Time that is Machian, which was previously\nrealized for relational triangle and minisuperspace models. This resolution has\nthree levels: classical, semiclassical and combined\nsemiclassical-histories-records. This article's specific model is a slightly\ninhomogeneous cosmology considered for now at the classical level. This is\nmotivated by how the inhomogeneous fluctuations that underlie structure\nformation - galaxies and CMB hotspots - might have been seeded by quantum\ncosmological fluctuations, as magnified by some inflationary mechanism. In\nparticular, I consider the perturbations about $S^3$ case of this involving up\nto second order, which has a number of parallels with the Halliwell-Hawking\nmodel but has a number of conceptual differences and useful upgrades. The\narticle's main features are that the elimination part of the model's thin\nsandwich is straightforward, but the modewise split of the constraints fail to\nbe first-class constraints. Thus the elimination part only arises as an\nintermediate geometry between superspace and Riem. The reduced geometries have\nsurprising singularities influenced by the matter content of the universe,\nthough the N-body problem anticipates these with its collinear singularities.

Our aim is to unveil a new principle\ngoverning X-ray luminosities of X-ray binaries, with a simple analysis of fluid\nequations simulating line-driven wind flow under influence of X-ray\nirradiation. In this study, we solve equation of motion of the accretion flow\ntaking into account the line-driven acceleration and X-ray photo-ionization.\nUnder the influence of X-ray irradiation, we find the flow equations take two\ntypes of solutions. The first solution is characterized by a slow wind velocity\nwhich causes a large accretion rate. The second solution is a fast wind flow\nwhich results in a small accretion rate. We find that only the solution with a\nfast wind and faint X-ray luminosity is a steady solution. On the other hand,\nslow wind solution with a large X-ray luminosity is not a realizable solution.\nIn bright X-ray binary systems, X-ray luminosity would increase until strong\nX-ray reduces the line-driven acceleration and causes a stagnation of the wind.\nThis result implies an important consequence that the X-ray luminosity of the\nwind-fed, X-ray emitting binary will be settled by the wind stagnation limit.\nAt the same time, the fast wind solution with small X-ray luminosity also can\nbe a steady state. Bright X-ray sources, such as Vela X-1, would have limiting\nluminosities of wind stagnation, while faint systems such a quiescent Super\ngiant Fast X-ray Transients could be on the faint solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Mar 2014 07:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}
