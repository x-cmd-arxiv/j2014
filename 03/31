The model\nconsiders a system of rational agents interacting in a game theoretical\nframework. This evolution drives the dynamic of the agents in both wealth and\neconomic configuration variables. The cost function is chosen to represent a\nrisk averse strategy of each agent. That is, the agent is more likely to\ninteract with the market, the more predictable the market, and therefore the\nsmaller its individual risk. This yields a kinetic equation for an effective\nsingle particle agent density with a Nash equilibrium serving as the local\nthermodynamic equilibrium. We consider a regime of scale separation where the\nlarge scale dynamics is given by a hydrodynamic closure with this local\nequilibrium. A class of generalized collision invariants (GCIs) is developed to\novercome the difficulty of the non-conservative property in the hydrodynamic\nclosure derivation of the large scale dynamics for the evolution of wealth\ndistribution. The result is a system of gas dynamics-type equations for the\ndensity and average wealth of the agents on large scales. We recover the\ninverse Gamma distribution, which has been previously considered in the\nliterature, as a local equilibrium for particular choices of the cost function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Mar 2014 18:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The MBS data transmission using reduced power subframes was\nstandardized in LTE Rel. 11, which can improve the capacity in macrocell while\nnot causing high interference to the nearby picocells. In order to get maximum\nbenefit from the reduced power subframes, setting the key system parameters,\nsuch as the amount of power reduction, carries critical importance. Using\nstochastic geometry, this paper lays down a theoretical foundation for the\nperformance evaluation of heterogeneous networks with reduced power subframes\nand range expansion bias. The analytic expressions for average capacity and 5th\npercentile throughput are derived as a function of transmit powers, node\ndensities, and interference coordination parameters in a heterogeneous network\nscenario, and are validated through Monte Carlo simulations.

In this Letter, from the observed\nphotospheric vector magnetogram, we implement a nonlinear force-free field\n(NLFFF) extrapolation of a coronal magnetic FR that supports a large-scale\nintermediate filament between an active region and a weak polarity region. This\nresult is the first in that current NLFFF extrapolations with presence of FRs\nare limited to relatively small-scale filaments that are close to sunspots and\nalong main polarity inversion line (PIL) with strong transverse field and\nmagnetic shear, and the existence of a FR is usually predictable. In contrast,\nthe present filament lies along the weak-field region (photospheric field\nstrength $\\lesssim 100$ G), where the PIL is very fragmented due to small\nparasitic polarities on both side of the PIL and the transverse field has a low\nvalue of signal-to-noise ratio. Thus it represents a far more difficult\nchallenge to extrapolate a large-scale FR in such case. We demonstrate that our\nCESE--MHD--NLFFF code is competent for the challenge. The numerically\nreproduced magnetic dips of the extrapolated FR match observations of the\nfilament and its barbs very well, which supports strongly the FR-dip model for\nfilaments. The filament is stably sustained because the FR is weakly twisted\nand strongly confined by the overlying closed arcades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Mar 2014 20:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The approach was developed\nspecifically for friction stir welding and friction stir processing\napplications, but is sufficiently general to be of use in a variety of other\nprocesses that involve sliding contact and heating at a tool-workpiece\ninterface. The methodology works with a finite element framework that is\nintended to predict the evolution of the microstructural state of the workpiece\nmaterial as it undergoes a complex thermomechanical history imposed by the\nprocess tooling. We employ a three-dimensional, Eulerian, finite element\nformulation; it includes coupling among the solutions for velocity, temperature\nand material state evolution. A critical element of the methodology is a\nprocedure to estimate the tool interface traction and temperature from typical,\nmeasured values of force and torque. The procedure leads naturally to an\nintuitive basis for estimating error that is used in conjunction with multiple\nmeshes to assure convergence. The methodology is demonstrate for a suite of\nthree experiments that had been previously published as part of a study on the\neffect of weld speed on friction stir welding. The probe interface temperatures\nand torques are estimated for all three weld speeds and the multi-mesh error\nestimation methodology is employed to quantify the rate of convergence.\nFinally, comparison of computed and measured power usage is used as a further\nvalidation. Using the converged results, trends in the material flow,\ntemperature, stress, deformation rate and material state with changing weld\nconditions are examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Mar 2014 22:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-01"}

However, this does not negate the ability for those using them to\nmake mistakes in proofs. To this end, there is a project (Quantomatic) to build\na proof assistant for string diagrams, at least for those based on categories\nwith a notion of trace. The development of string graphs has provided a\ncombinatorial formalisation of string diagrams, laying the foundations for this\nproject.\n  The prevalence of commutative Frobenius algebras (CFAs) in quantum\ninformation theory, a major application area of these diagrams, has led to the\nuse of variable-arity nodes as a shorthand for normalised networks of Frobenius\nalgebra morphisms, so-called \"spider notation\". This notation greatly eases\nreasoning with CFAs, but string graphs are inadequate to properly encode this\nreasoning.\n  This dissertation extends string graphs to allow for variable-arity nodes to\nbe represented at all, and then introduces !-box notation (and structures to\nencode it) to represent string graph equations containing repeated subgraphs,\nwhere the number of repetitions is abitrary. It then demonstrates how we can\nreason directly about !-graphs, viewed as (typically infinite) families of\nstring graphs. Of particular note is the presentation of a form of graph-based\ninduction, allowing the formal encoding of proofs that previously could only be\nrepresented as a mix of string diagrams and explanatory text.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Mar 2014 22:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-01"}

To\novercome the significant propagation loss over distance, employing\nmulti-antennas at the energy transmitter (ET) to more efficiently direct\nwireless energy to desired energy receivers (ERs), termed \\emph{energy\nbeamforming}, is an essential technique for enabling WET. However, the\nachievable gain of energy beamforming crucially depends on the available\nchannel state information (CSI) at the ET, which needs to be acquired\npractically. In this paper, we study the design of an efficient channel\nacquisition method for a point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nWET system by exploiting the channel reciprocity, i.e., the ET estimates the\nCSI via dedicated reverse-link training from the ER. Considering the limited\nenergy availability at the ER, the training strategy should be carefully\ndesigned so that the channel can be estimated with sufficient accuracy, and yet\nwithout consuming excessive energy at the ER. To this end, we propose to\nmaximize the \\emph{net} harvested energy at the ER, which is the average\nharvested energy offset by that used for channel training. An optimization\nproblem is formulated for the training design over MIMO Rician fading channels,\nincluding the subset of ER antennas to be trained, as well as the training time\nand power allocated.

We show that, different types of progenitors lead to different\nprobabilities for a FRB to be gravitationally lensed by dark matter halos in\nforeground galaxies, since different type progenitors result in different\nredshift distributions of FRBs. For example, the redshift distribution of FRBs\narising from double stars shifts toward lower redshift than of the FRBs arising\nfrom single stars, because double stars and single stars have different\nevolution timescales. With detailed calculations, we predict that the FRB\nsample size for producing one lensing event varies significantly for different\nFRB progenitor models. We argue that this fact can be used to distinguish\ndifferent FRB models and also discuss the practical possibility of using\nlensing observation in radio surveys to constrain FRB progenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 05:47:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 May 2014 07:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-15"}

The task is to identify the inlier features and establish their\nconsistent correspondences across the image set. This is a challenging\ncombinatorial problem, and the problem complexity grows exponentially with the\nimage number. To this end, we propose a novel framework, termed ROML, to\naddress this problem. ROML optimizes simultaneously a partial permutation\nmatrix (PPM) for each image, and feature correspondences are established by the\nobtained PPMs. Two of our key contributions are summarized as follows. (1) We\nformulate the problem as rank and sparsity minimization for PPM optimization,\nand treat simultaneous optimization of multiple PPMs as a regularized consensus\nproblem in the context of distributed optimization. (2) We use the ADMM method\nto solve the thus formulated ROML problem, in which a subproblem associated\nwith a single PPM optimization appears to be a difficult integer quadratic\nprogram (IQP). We prove that under wildly applicable conditions, this IQP is\nequivalent to a linear sum assignment problem (LSAP), which can be efficiently\nsolved to an exact solution.

Our main concern is\nto determine possible deviations from the predictions of classical linear\nelastostatics when a more refined theory is employed to attack the problem. Of\nspecial importance is the behavior of the new solution near to the point of\napplication of the load where pathological singularities exist in the classical\nsolution. The use of the theory of gradient elasticity is intended here to\nmodel the response of materials with microstructure in a manner that the\nclassical theory cannot afford. A linear version of this theory results by\nconsidering a linear isotropic expression for the strain-energy density that\ndepends on strain-gradient terms, in addition to the standard strain terms\nappearing in classical elasticity. Through this formulation, a microstructural\nmaterial constant is introduced, in addition to the standard Lam\\'e constants.\nThe solution method is based on integral transforms and is exact. The present\nresults show significant departure from the predictions of classical\nelasticity.

Sh2-90 presents a bubble morphology in the mid-IR (size ~ 0.9 pc\nx 1.6 pc).

Given two input graphs $G_1=(V_1,E_1),\nG_2=(V_2,E_2)$, a pair of vertex mappings induces an {\\it edge conservation} if\nthe vertex pairs are adjacent in their respective graphs. %In general terms The\ngoal is to provide a one-to-one mapping between the vertices of the input\ngraphs in order to maximize edge conservation. However the allowed mappings are\nrestricted since each vertex from $V_1$ (resp. $V_2$) is allowed to be mapped\nto at most $m_1$ (resp. $m_2$) specified vertices in $V_2$ (resp. $V_1$). Most\nof results in this paper deal with the case $m_2=1$ which attracted most\nattention in the related literature.

Methods. The He I 1083.0 nm triplet Stokes profiles are analyzed\nwith an inversion code that takes into account the physics responsible of the\npolarization signals in this triplet. The results are put into a solar context\nwith the help of extreme ultraviolet observations taken with the Solar Dynamic\nObservatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory satellites.\nResults: For the most probable magnetic field vector configuration, the\nanalysis depicts a mean field strength of 7 gauss.

We present a multiplex network approach\nto social tie strength, here applied to mobile communication data - calls, text\nmessages, and co-location, allowing us to dimensionally identify relationships\nby considering the number of communication channels utilized between students.\nWe find that strong social ties are characterized by maximal use of\ncommunication channels, while weak ties by minimal use. We are able to identify\n75% of close friendships, 90% of weaker ties, and 90% of Facebook friendships\nas compared to reported ground truth. We then show that stronger ties exhibit\ngreater profile similarity than weaker ones.

To this end, we develop an energy-efficient Predictive Green\nStreaming (PGS) optimization framework that leverages predictions of wireless\ndata rates to achieve the following objectives 1) minimize the required\ntransmission airtime without causing streaming interruptions, 2) minimize total\ndownlink Base Station (BS) power consumption for cases where BSs can be\nswitched off in deep sleep, and 3) enable a trade-off between AS quality and\nenergy consumption.

Then, to provide an\nonline solution, we present a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm that\ndecouples the PGS problem into multiple stages.

However, traditional multicast protocols designed for IP\nnetworks are usually bottlenecked by the limited state capacity on switches. In\nthis paper, we propose a scalable multicast solution on fat tree networks based\non the observation that data center multicast traffic has strong heterogeneity.\nWe propose to remove the multicast management logic from switches and use the\nSDN controller to manage multicast groups. The proposed Dual-structure\nMulticast (DuSM) determines elephant and mice groups according to their traffic\namounts and treats them separately. For each elephant group, the controller\ninstalls multicast state to maintain multiple shared trees and the group\ntraffic will be balanced evenly among the trees to avoid congestion. For mice\ngroups, the controller applies state-free mutlicast that trades bandwidth\ncapacity for state capacity, such as multicast-to-unicast translation. Our\nexperiments using real multicast traffic data show that the number of groups\nDuSM supports can be 300% of that of IP multicast. DuSM also achieves traffic\nbalance among links.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 15:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-01"}
