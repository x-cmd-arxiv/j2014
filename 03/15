They could\nseem to be in contradiction with natural selection, as non-cooperators have an\nincreased fitness compared to cooperators. Understanding the emergence of\ncooperation has necessitated the development of concepts and models (inclusive\nfitness, multilevel selection, ...) attributing deterministic advantages to\nthis behavior. In contrast to these models, we show here that cooperative\nbehaviors can emerge by taking into account the stochastic nature of\nevolutionary dynamics : when cooperative behaviors increase the carrying\ncapacity of the habitat, they also increase the genetic drift against\nnon-cooperators. Using the Wright-Fisher models of population genetics, we\ncompute exactly this increased genetic drift and its consequences on the\nfixation probability of both types of individuals. This computation leads to a\nsimple criterion: cooperative behavior dominates when the relative increase in\ncarrying capacity of the habitat caused by cooperators is higher than the\nselection pressure against them. This is a purely stochastic effect with no\ndeterministic interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 16:12:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-17"}

We discuss the\nimplications of the coreshine detected from the molecular cloud core L1506C in\nthe Taurus filament for the history of the core and the existence of a\nprimitive ISM component of large grains becoming visible in cores. The\ncoreshine surface brightness of L1506C is determined from IRAC Spitzer images\nat 3.6 micron. We perform grain growth calculations to estimate the grain size\ndistribution in model cores similar in gas density, radius, and turbulent\nvelocity to L1506C. Scattered light intensities at 3.6 micron are calculated\nfor a variety of MRN and grain growth distributions to compare with the\nobserved coreshine. For a core with the overall physical properties of L1506C,\nno detectable coreshine is predicted for an MRN size distribution. Extending\nthe distribution to grain radii of about 0.65 $\\mu$m allows to reproduce the\nobserved surface brightness level in scattered light. Assuming the properties\nof L1506C to be preserved, models for the growth of grains in cores do not\nyield sufficient scattered light to account for the coreshine within the\nlifetime of the Taurus complex. Only increasing the core density and the\nturbulence amplifies the scattered light intensity to a level consistent with\nthe observed coreshine brightness. The grains could be part of primitive\nomni-present large grain population becoming visible in the densest part of the\nISM, could grow under the turbulent dense conditions of former cores, or in\nL1506C itself. In the later case, L1506C must have passed through a period of\nlarger density and stronger turbulence. This would be consistent with the\nsurprisingly strong depletion usually attributed to high column densities, and\nwith the large-scale outward motion of the core envelope observed today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 17:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

It is a contribution to categorical logic,\nin particular to the theory of realizability toposes.\n  While the tools of categorical logic have proven very successful in analyzing\nand organizing proof theoretic realizability interpretations, it was remarked\nby experts (notably Peter Johnstone) that the field of realizability toposes\nitself was not clearly delineated, and lacked a powerful theory analogous to\nthat of Grothendieck toposes.\n  The present work sets out to remedy this situation to a certain extent. We\nargue that realizability toposes are best understood using Grothendieck\nfibrations, and develop a framework of fibrational cocompletions, which allows\nto view certain constructions from realizability in precise analogy to\nconstructions of presheaf and sheaf toposes. Using these techniques, and a\nclass of posetal fibrations that we call uniform preorders, we are able to give\nan extensional characterization of partial combinatory algebras and of the\nrealizability toposes that are constructed from these algebras.\n  Striving to develop the analogy to Grothendieck toposes further, we outline\nhow to apply our techniques on arbitrary base toposes, and give a decomposition\ntheorem for constant objects functors induced by triposes, analogous to the\nknown decompositions of geometric morphisms. Finally, we sketch an approach of\nhow to find a unified framework for Grothendieck toposes and realizability\ntoposes, based on the observation that uniform preorders can be identified with\npreorders internal to a category of sheaves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 19:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-17"}

The aim of this work is to constrain the evolution of the fraction of\nLya emitters among UV selected star forming galaxies at 2<z<6, and to measure\nthe stellar escape fraction of Lya photons over the same redshift range.\nMethods. We exploit the ultradeep spectroscopic observations collected by the\nVIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS) to build an unique, complete and unbiased sample\nof 4000 spectroscopically confirmed star forming galaxies at 2<z<6. Our galaxy\nsample UV luminosities brighter than M* at 2<z<6, and luminosities down to one\nmagnitude fainter than M* at 2<z<3.5. Results. We find that 80% of the star\nforming galaxies in our sample have EW0(Lya)<10A, and correspondingly\nfesc(Lya)<1%. By comparing these results with literature, we conclude that the\nbulk of the Lya luminosity at 2<z<6 comes from galaxies that are fainter in the\nUV than those we sample in this work. The strong Lya emitters constitute, at\neach redshift, the tail of the distribution of the galaxies with extreme\nEW0(Lya) and fesc(Lya) . This tail of large EW0 and fesc(Lya) becomes more\nimportant as the redshift increases, and causes the fraction of Lya with EW0>\n25A to increase from 5% at z=2 to 30% at z=6, with the increase being\nrelatively stronger beyond z=4. We observe no difference, for the narrow range\nof UV luminosities explored in this work, between the fraction of strong Lya\nemitters among galaxies fainter or brighter than M*, although the fraction for\nthe FUV faint galaxies evolves faster, at 2<z<3.5, than for the bright ones.

However,\nwhen the dust content is low (E(B-V)<0.05) we observe a very broad range of\nfesc(Lya), ranging from 10^-3 to 1.

The range of instellation that permits both complete ice cover and\nat least partially ice-free climate states is a measure of the climate\nhysteresis that a planet can exhibit. An ice-covered planet with high climate\nhysteresis would show a higher resistance to the initial loss of surface ice\ncoverage with increases in instellation, and abrupt, extreme ice loss once\ndeglaciation begins.

H' rests deep within the superconducting phase and the\nlinear-in-H behavior is observed in the zero resistance regime. In the limit of\nzero temperature, C$_{elec}/T$ is proportional to the zero-energy electronic\ndensity of states.

In particular, the $n$-th Fourier coefficient of Klein's\n$j$-function is the dimension of the grade $n$ part of a special infinite\ndimensional representation $V$ of the monster group. More generally the\ncoefficients of Hauptmoduln are graded traces $T_g$ of $g \\in M$ acting on $V$.\nSimilar phenomena have been shown to hold for the Matthieu group $M_{24}$, but\ninstead of modular functions, mock modular forms must be used. This has been\nconjecturally generalized even further, to umbral moonshine, which associates\nto each of the 23 Niemeier lattices a finite group, infinite dimensional\nrepresentation, and mock modular form. We use generalized Borcherds products to\nrelate monstrous moonshine and umbral moonshine. Namely, we use mock modular\nforms from umbral moonshine to construct via generalized Borcherds products\nrational functions of the Hauptmoduln $T_g$ from monstrous moonshine. This\nallows us to associate to each pure $A$-type Niemeier lattice a conjugacy class\n$g$ of the monster group, and gives rise to identities relating dimensions of\nrepresentations from umbral moonshine to values of $T_g$.

A potentially powerful approach for doing this\nwould be to exploit three-dimensional spectral maps, i.e. the specific\nintensity of extragalactic light as a function of wavelength and direction on\nthe sky, to measure spatial variations in the total extragalactic light\nemission and use these as a tracer of the clustering of matter. A main\nchallenge is that the observed intensity as a function of wavelength is a\nconvolution of the source luminosity density with the rest-frame spectral\nenergy distribution. In this paper, we introduce the method of spectral\ndeconvolution as a way to invert this convolution and extract the clustering\ninformation. We show how one can use observations of the mean and angular\nfluctuations of extragalactic light as a function of wavelength, assuming\nstatistical isotropy, to reconstruct jointly the rest-frame spectral energy\ndistribution of the sources and the source spatial density fluctuations. This\nmethod is more general than the well known line mapping technique as it does\nnot rely on spectral lines in the emitted spectra. After introducing the\ngeneral formalism, we discuss its implementation and limitations.

In this sense, the behaviour of an ISCO\naround a rotating oblate neutron star is formed by the interplay between\nrelativistic and Newtonian effects. Here we briefly explore the consequences of\nthis interplay using a straightforward analytic approach as well as numerical\nmodels that involve modern NS equations of state. We examine the ratio K\nbetween the ISCO radius and the radius of the neutron star. We find that, with\ngrowing NS spin, the ratio K first decreases, but then starts to increase. This\nnon-monotonic behaviour of K can give rise to a neutron star spin interval in\nwhich ISCO appears for two very different ranges of NS mass. This may strongly\naffect the distribution of neutron stars that have an ISCO (ISCO-NS). When\n(all) neutron stars are distributed around a high mass M0, the ISCO-NS spin\ndistribution is roughly the same as the spin distribution corresponding to all\nneutron stars. In contrast, if M0 is low, the ISCO-NS distribution can only\nhave a peak around a high value of spin. Finally, an intermediate value of M0\ncan imply an ISCO-NS distribution divided into two distinct groups of slow and\nfast rotators. Our findings have immediate astrophysical applications. They can\nbe used for example to distinguish between different models of high-frequency\nquasiperiodic oscillations observed in low-mass NS X-ray binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 23:41:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

In this work,\nstrain effect on the electronic band structure of phosphorene was studied using\nfirst principles methods. It was found that phosphorene can withstand a surface\ntension and tensile strain up to 10 N/m and 30%, respectively. The band gap of\nphosphorene experiences a direct-indirect-direct transition when axial strain\nis applied. A moderate -2% compression in the zigzag direction can trigger this\ngap transition. With sufficient expansion (+11.3%) or compression (-10.2%\nstrains), the gap can be tuned from indirect to direct again. Five strain zones\nwith distinct electronic band structure were identified and the critical\nstrains for the zone boundaries were determined. The origin of the gap\ntransition was revealed and a general mechanism was developed to explain energy\nshifts with strain according to the bond nature of near-band-edge electronic\norbitals. Effective masses of carriers in the armchair direction are an order\nof magnitude smaller than that of the zigzag axis indicating the armchair\ndirection is favored for carrier transport. In addition, the effective masses\ncan be dramatically tuned by strain, in which its sharp jump/drop occurs at the\nzone boundaries of the direct-indirect gap transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Mar 2014 08:48:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 04:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-11"}

Girard developed a logical theory, called Ludics. This\ntheory was a step in his program of Geometry of Interaction, the aim of which\nbeing to account for the dynamics of logical proofs. In Ludics, objects called\ndesigns keep only what is relevant for the cut elimination process, hence the\ndynamics of a proof: a design is an abstraction of a formal proof. The notion\nof behaviour is the counterpart in Ludics of the notion of type or the logical\nnotion of formula. Formally a behaviour is a closed set of designs. Our aim is\nto explore the constructions of behaviours and to analyse their properties. In\nthis paper a design is viewed as a set of coherent paths. We recall or give\nvariants of properties concerning visitable paths, where a visitable path is a\npath in a design or a set of designs that may be traversed by interaction with\na design of the orthogonal of the set. We are then able to answer the following\nquestion: which properties should satisfy a set of paths for being exactly the\nset of visitable paths of a behaviour? Such a set and its dual should be\nprefix-closed, daimon-closed and satisfy two saturation properties. This allows\nus to have a means for defining the whole set of visitable paths of a given set\nof designs without closing it explicitly, that is without computing the\northogonal of this set of designs. We finally apply all these results for\nmaking explicit the structure of a behaviour generated by constants and\nmultiplicative/additive connectives.

This nucleus contains a\nrich molecular gas environment and an unusually high ratio of infrared to radio\nluminosity (q-factor). The compact nucleus is powered by either a compact\nstarburst or an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The aim of this study is to\nconstrain the nature of the nuclear region (starburst or AGN) within NGC 4418\nvia very-high-resolution radio imaging. Archival data from radio observations\nusing the EVN and MERLIN interferometers are imaged. Sizes and flux densities\nare obtained by fitting Gaussian intensity distributions to the image. The\naverage spectral index of the compact radio emission is estimated from\nmeasurements at 1.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz. The nuclear structure of NGC 4418 visible\nwith EVN and MERLIN consists of eight compact (<49 mas i.e. <8 pc) features\nspread within a region of 250 mas, i.e. 41 pc. We derive an inverted spectral\nindex $\\alpha\\ge0.7$ ($S_\\nu\\propto\\nu^{\\alpha}$) for the compact radio\nemission. Brightness temperatures $>10^{4.8}$ K indicate that these compact\nfeatures cannot be HII-regions. The complex morphology and inverted spectrum of\nthe eight detected compact features is evidence against the hypothesis that an\nAGN alone is powering the nucleus of NGC 4418. The compact features could be\nsuper star clusters (SSCs) with intense star formation, and their associated\nfree-free absorption could then naturally explain both their inverted radio\nspectrum and the low radio to IR ratio of the nucleus. The required star\nformation area density is extreme, however, and close to the limit of what can\nbe observed in a well-mixed thermal/non-thermal plasma produced by\nstar-formation, and is also close to the limit of what can be physically\nsustained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Mar 2014 10:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-04"}

In\nthis case, the linearized system does qualitatively capture the dynamics in a\nsmall neighborhood of the hyperbolic steady state. However, one is often forced\nto consider non-hyperbolic steady states, for example in the context of\nbifurcation theory. A geometric technique to desingularize non-hyperbolic\npoints is the blow-up method. The classical case of the method is motivated by\ndesingularization techniques arising in algebraic geometry. The idea is to blow\nup the steady state to a sphere or a cylinder. In the blown-up space, one is\nthen often able to gain additional hyperbolicity at steady states. In this\npaper, we discuss an explicit example where we replace the sphere in the\nblow-up by hyperbolic space. It is shown that the calculations work in the\nhyperbolic space case as for the spherical case. This approach may be even\nslightly more convenient if one wants to work with directional charts. Hence,\nit is demonstrated that the sphere should be viewed as an auxiliary object in\nthe blow-up construction. Other smooth manifolds are also natural candidates to\nbe inserted at steady states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Mar 2014 11:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

The\ndevelopment of the theory is illustrated by numerous examples, including matrix\ngroups with entries in the the field of real or complex numbers, or other\nlocally compact fields such as p-adic fields, isometry groups of various metric\nspaces, and, last but not least, discrete group themselves. Word metrics for\ncompactly generated groups play a major role. In the particular case of\nfinitely generated groups, they were introduced by Dehn around 1910 in\nconnection with the Word Problem. Some of the results exposed concern general\nlocally compact groups, such as criteria for the existence of compatible\nmetrics on locally compact groups.

By\nmeans of the numerical analysis and variational approximation, we demonstrate\nthat the two-component model of the Bose-Einstein condensate, with the\nspin-orbit Rashba coupling and cubic attractive interactions, gives rise to\nsolitary-vortex complexes of two types: semi-vortices (SVs, with a vortex in\none component and a fundamental soliton in the other), and mixed modes (MMs,\nwith topological charges 0 and +1/-1 mixed in both components). These two-\ndimensional composite modes can be created using the trapping\nharmonic-oscillator (HO) potential, but remain stable in the free space, if the\ntrap is gradually removed. The SVs and MMs realize the ground state of the\nsystem, provided that the self-attraction in the two components is,\nrespectively, stronger or weaker than the cross-attraction between them. The\nSVs and MMs which are not the ground state are subject to a drift instability.\nIn the free space (in the absence of the HO trap), modes of both types\ndegenerate into unstable Townes solitons when their norms attain the respective\ncritical values, while there is no lower existence threshold for the stable\nmodes. Moving free-space stable solitons are also found in the present\nnon-Galilean-invariant system, up to a critical velocity. Collisions between\ntwo moving solitons lead to their merger into a single one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Mar 2014 15:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

However, it is very important to\ncontrol the workload, e.g. the frequency of body movements, within the\ncapability of the individual to maximise the efficiency of the exercise. The\nworkload is generally represented in terms of heart rate (HR) and oxygen\nconsumption VO2. We focus particularly on the control of HR and VO2 using the\nworkload of an individual body movement, also known as the exercise rate (ER),\nin this research. The first part of this report deals with the modelling and\ncontrol of HR during an unknown type of rhythmic exercise. A novel feature of\nthe developed system is to control HR via manipulating ER as a control input.\nThe relation between ER and HR is modelled using a simple autoregressive model\nwith unknown parameters. The parameters of the model are estimated using a\nKalman filter and an indirect adaptive H1 controller is designed. The\nperformance of the system is tested and validated on six subjects during rowing\nand cycling exercise. The results demonstrate that the designed control system\ncan regulate HR to a predefined profile. The second part of this report deals\nwith the problem of estimating VO2 during rhythmic exercise, as the direct\nmeasurement of VO2 is not realisable in these environments. Therefore,\nnon-invasive sensors are used to measure HR, RespR, and ER to estimate VO2. The\ndeveloped approach for cycling and rowing exercise predicts the percentage\nchange in maximum VO2 from the resting to the exercising phases, using a\nHammerstein model.. Results show that the average quality of fit in both\nexercises is improved as the intensity of exercise is increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Mar 2014 05:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-28"}
