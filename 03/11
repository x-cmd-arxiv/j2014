Those with a more massive\ncomponent filling the Roche lobe are SD1 binaries whereas in SD2 binaries the\nRoche lobe filling component is less massive. Our evolutionary model assumes\nthat, following the Roche lobe overflow by the more massive component (donor),\nmass transfer occurs until mass ratio reversal. A binary in an initial phase of\nmass transfer, before mass equalization, is identified with SD1 binary. We show\nthat the transferred mass forms an equatorial bulge around the less massive\ncomponent (accretor). Its presence slows down the mass transfer rate to the\nvalue determined by the thermal time scale of the accretor, once the bulge\nsticks out above the Roche lobe. It means, that in a binary with a (typical)\nmass ratio of 0.5 the SD1 phase lasts at least 10 times longer than resulting\nfrom the standard evolutionary computations neglecting this effect. This is why\nwe observe so many SD1 binaries. Our explanation is in contradiction to\npredictions identifying the SD1 phase with a broken contact phase of the\nThermal Relaxation Oscillations model. The continued mass transfer, past mass\nequalization, results in mass ratio reversed. SD2 binaries are identified with\nthis phase. Our model predicts that the time scales of SD1 and SD2 phases are\ncomparable to one another. Analysis of the observations of 22 SD1 binaries, 27\nSD2 binaries and 110 contact binaries (CBs) shows that relative number of both\ntypes of NCBs favors similar time scales of both phases of mass transfer. Total\nmasses, orbital angular momenta and orbital periods of SD1 and SD2 binaries are\nindistinguishable from each other whereas they differ substantially from the\ncorresponding parameters of CBs. We conclude that the results of the analysis\nfully support the model presented in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 17:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-11"}

We have tried to resolve this\nquestion by studying the thermal stability of a thin disk with magnetically\ndriven winds in the $\\dot{M}- \\Sigma$ plane. It is found that disk winds can\ngreatly decrease the disk temperature and thus help the disk become more stable\nat a given accretion rate. The critical accretion rate $\\dot{M}_{\\rm crit}$\ncorresponding to the thermal instability threshold is increased significantly\nin the presence of disk winds. For $\\alpha=0.01$ and $B_{\\rm \\phi}=10B_{\\rm\n_p}$, the disk is quite stable even for a very weak initial poloidal magnetic\nfield [$\\beta_{\\rm p,0}\\sim 2000, \\beta_{\\rm p}=(P_{\\rm {gas}}+P_{\\rm\nrad})/(B_{\\rm p}^2/8\\pi)$].

The advection and diffusion timescales of the large-scale\nmagnetic field threading the disk are also investigated in this work. We find\nthat the advection timescale can be smaller than the diffusion timescale in a\ndisk with winds, because the disk winds take away most of the gravitational\nenergy released in the disk, resulting in the decrease of the magnetic\ndiffusivity $\\eta$ and the increase of the diffusion timescale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 17:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We can therefore predict at what temperatures\nethylene oxide forms on grain surfaces and at what temperature it starts to\ndesorb into the gas phase. The model reproduces the observed gaseous abundances\nof ethylene oxide and acetaldehyde towards high-mass star-forming regions. In\naddition, our results show that ethylene oxide may be present in outer and\ncooler regions of hot cores where its isomer has already been detected. Despite\ntheir different chemical structures, the chemistry of ethylene oxide is coupled\nto that of acetaldehyde, suggesting that acetaldehyde may be used as a tracer\nfor ethylene oxide towards cold cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 19:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

In addition, among the objects we studied, there are 26 USP\ncandidates that had been previously reported in the literature which do not\npass our various tests. All 106 of our candidates have passed several standard\ntests to rule out false positives due to eclipsing stellar systems. A low false\npositive rate is also implied by the relatively high fraction of candidates for\nwhich more than one transiting planet signal was detected. By assuming these\nmulti-transit candidates represent coplanar multi-planet systems, we are able\nto infer that the USP planets are typically accompanied by other planets with\nperiods in the range 1-50 days, in contrast with hot Jupiters which very rarely\nhave companions in that same period range. Another clear pattern is that almost\nall USP planets are smaller than 2 $R_\\oplus$, possibly because gas giants in\nvery tight orbits would lose their atmospheres by photoevaporation when subject\nto extremely strong stellar irradiation.

This is illustrated in the case of a\nparticular class of scenarios leading to monotop production.

In comparison to existing\nimages of this radio halo the detection in our images is at higher\nsignificance. The radio halo is as extended as the X-ray emission in the\ndirection of cluster merger but is significantly less extended than the X-ray\nemission in the perpendicular direction. At low significance we detect a faint\nsecond peak in the radio halo close to the X-ray centroid of the smaller\nsub-cluster (the bullet) suggesting that, similarly to the X-ray emission, the\nradio halo may consist of two components. Finally, we find that the distinctive\nshape of the western edge of the radio halo traces out the X-ray detected bow\nshock. The radio halo morphology and the lack of strong point-to-point\ncorrelations between radio, X-ray and weak-lensing properties suggests that the\nradio halo is still being formed. The colocation of the X-ray shock with a\ndistinctive radio brightness edge illustrates that the shock is influencing the\nstructure of the radio halo. These observations support the theory that shocks\nand turbulence influence the formation and evolution of radio halo synchrotron\nemission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 20:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

A central goal in this field is to find models\nwith ground states that are universal for MBQC and that are also natural in the\nsense that they involve only two-body interactions and have a small local\nHilbert space dimension. Graph states are the original resource states for\nMBQC, and while it is not possible to obtain graph states as exact ground\nstates of two-body Hamiltonians here we construct two-body frustration-free\nHamiltonians that have arbitrarily good approximations of graph states as\nunique ground states. The construction involves taking a two-body\nfrustration-free model that has a ground state convertible to a graph state\nwith stochastic local operations, then deforming the model such that its ground\nstate is close to a graph state. Each graph state qubit resides in a subspace\nof a higher dimensional particle. This deformation can be applied to two-body\nfrustration-free Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) models, yielding\nHamiltonians that are exactly solvable with exact tensor network expressions\nfor ground states. For the star-lattice AKLT model, the ground state of which\nis not expected to be a universal resource for MBQC, applying such a\ndeformation appears to enhance the computational power of the ground state,\npromoting it to a universal resource for MBQC. Transitions in computational\npower, similar to percolation phase transitions, can be observed when\nHamiltonians are deformed in this way. Improving the fidelity of the ground\nstate comes at the cost of a shrinking gap. While analytically proving gap\nproperties for these types of models is difficult in general, we provide a\ndetailed analysis of the deformation of a spin-1 AKLT state to a linear graph\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2014 20:38:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 05:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-11"}

Recent calculations\nof the scattering of axion-conversion X-rays suggest that the sunward\nmagnetosphere could be an observable source of 0.2-10 keV photons. For\nXMM-Newton, any conversion X-ray intensity will be seasonally modulated by\nvirtue of the changing visibility of the sunward magnetic field region. A\nsimple model of the geomagnetic field is combined with the ephemeris of\nXMM-Newton to predict the seasonal variation of the conversion X-ray intensity.\nThis model is compared with stacked XMM-Newton blank sky datasets from which\npoint sources have been systematically removed. Remarkably, a seasonally\nvarying X-ray background signal is observed. The EPIC count rates are in the\nratio of their X-ray grasps, indicating a non-instrumental, external photon\norigin, with significances of 11(pn), 4(MOS1) and 5(MOS2) sigma.

We focus\non the effects of thermal perturbations, intentionally simplifying the problem\nthrough omission of clouds and atmospheric circulation. Model results\ndemonstrate that thermal perturbations occurring deep in the atmosphere (at\npressures greater than 10 bar) of a model T-dwarf can be communicated to the\nupper atmosphere through radiative heating via the windows in near-infrared\nwater opacity. The response time depends on where in the atmosphere a thermal\nperturbation is introduced. We show that, for certain periodic perturbations,\nthe emission spectrum can have complex, time- and wavelength-dependent\nbehaviors, including phase shifts in times of maximum flux observed at\ndifferent wavelengths. Since different wavelengths probe different levels in\nthe atmosphere, these variations track a wavelength-dependent set of radiative\nexchanges happening between different atmospheric levels as a perturbation\nevolves in time.

A stochastic process is finitely\ndependent if variables at sufficiently well-separated locations are\nindependent; it is a block-factor if it can be expressed as an equivariant\nfinite-range function of independent variables. The problem of finding\nnon-block-factor finitely dependent processes dates back to 1965. The first\npublished example appeared in 1993, and we provide arguably the first natural\nexamples. More precisely, Schramm proved in 2008 that no stationary 1-dependent\n3-coloring of the integers exists, and conjectured that no stationary\nk-dependent q-coloring exists for any k and q. We disprove this by constructing\na 1-dependent 4-coloring and a 2-dependent 3-coloring, thus resolving the\nquestion for all k and q.\n  Our construction is canonical and natural, yet very different from all\nprevious schemes. In its pure form it yields precisely the two finitely\ndependent colorings mentioned above, and no others. The processes provide\nunexpected connections between extremal cases of the Lovasz local lemma and\ndescent and peak sets of random permutations. Neither coloring can be expressed\nas a block-factor, nor as a function of a finite-state Markov chain; indeed, no\nstationary finitely dependent coloring can be so expressed. We deduce\nextensions involving d dimensions and shifts of finite type; in fact, any\nnon-degenerate shift of finite type also distinguishes between block-factors\nand finitely dependent processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 00:47:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Apr 2014 07:03:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 May 2014 21:25:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2015 22:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-08"}

To achieve high sensitivity, large collecting area is needed\nand dispersion due to the interstellar medium should be removed. To survey a\nlarge part of the sky in reasonable time, a telescope that forms multiple\nsimultaneous beams is desirable. We have developed a novel FPGA-based transient\nsearch engine that is suitable for these circumstances. It accepts\nshort-integration-time spectral power measurements from each beam of the\ntelescope, performs incoherent de-dispersion simultaneously for each of a wide\nrange of dispersion measure (DM) values, and automatically searches the\nde-dispersed time series for pulse-like events. If the telescope provides\nbuffering of the raw voltage samples of each beam, then our system can provide\ntrigger signals to allow data in those buffers to be saved when a tentative\ndetection occurs; this can be done with a latency of tens of ms, and only the\nbuffers for beams with detections need to be saved. In one version of our\nimplementation, intended for the ASKAP array of 36 antennas (currently under\nconstruction in Australia), 36 beams are simultaneously de-dispersed for 448\ndifferent DMs with an integration time of 1.0 ms. In the absence of such a\nmulti-beam telescope, we have built a second version that handles up to 6 beams\nat 0.1 ms integration time and 512 DMs. We have deployed and tested this at a\n34-m antenna of the Deep Space Network in Goldstone, California. A third\nversion that processes up to 6 beams at an integration time of 2.0 ms and 1,024\nDMs has been built and deployed at the Murchison Widefield Array telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 03:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-12"}

Explicit\nformulas are derived for the metrics, although they depend on many parameters\nsuch as the number of WLAN access points, the shape of each WLAN coverage\nregion, the location of each WLAN access point, the available bandwidth (bps)\nof the WLAN, and the shape and available bandwidth (bps) of each subregion\nidentified by the channel quality indicator in a cell of the cellular network.\nExplicit formulas strongly suggest that the bandwidth a user experiences does\nnot depend on the user mobility. This is because the bandwidth available by a\nuser who does not move and that available by a user who moves are the same or\napproximately the same as a probabilistic distribution. Numerical examples show\nthat parameters, such as the size of regions where placement of WLAN access\npoints is not allowed and the mean density of WLANs in high density regions,\nhave a large impact on performance metrics. In particular, a homogeneous\nPoisson process model as the WLAN access point location model largely\noverestimates the mean available bandwidth for a user and the number of\nvertical handovers. The overestimated mean available bandwidth is, for example,\nabout 50% in a certain condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 06:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-12"}

Furthermore, it is shown that no POVM exists, which approximately\nagrees with the probability current on a very natural set of wave functions;\nnevertheless, the choice of the set is crucial, and on more restrictive sets\nthe probability current does provide a good arrival time prediction. Some ideas\nto experimentally detect quantum effects in time measurements are discussed.\n  In the second part of the work the energy-time uncertainty relation is\nconsidered, in particular for a model of alpha decay for which the variance of\nthe energy can be calculated explicitly, and the variance of time can be\nestimated.

Quark stars and hybrid stars\nsubject to an external magnetic field were also studied. Larger star masses are\nobtained for the flavor independent vector interaction. Hybrid stars may bare a\ncore containing deconfined quarks if neither the vector interaction nor the\nmagnetic field are too strong. Also, the presence of strong magnetic fields\nseems to disfavor the existence of a quark core in hybrid stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 08:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-01"}

Thus, we obtain a new representation for the stationary distribution,\neffectively separating the limiting behaviour of the process at the boundaries\nfrom its behaviour in the interior of $(0,b)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 10:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-12"}

Osteocytes derive from bone-synthesising cells (osteoblasts) that\nbecome buried in bone matrix during bone deposition. The generation of\nosteocytes is a complex process that remains incompletely understood. Whilst\nosteoblast burial determines the density of osteocytes, the expanding network\nof osteocytes regulates in turn osteoblast activity and osteoblast burial. In\nthis paper, a spatiotemporal continuous model is proposed to investigate the\nosteoblast-to-osteocyte transition. The aims of the model are (i) to link\ndynamic properties of osteocyte generation with properties of the osteocyte\nnetwork imprinted in bone, and (ii) to investigate Marotti's hypothesis that\nosteocytes prompt the burial of osteoblasts when they become covered with\nsufficient bone matrix. Osteocyte density is assumed in the model to be\ngenerated at the moving bone surface by a combination of osteoblast density,\nmatrix secretory rate, rate of entrapment, and curvature of the bone substrate,\nbut is found to be determined solely by the ratio of the instantaneous burial\nrate and matrix secretory rate. Osteocyte density does not explicitly depend on\nosteoblast density nor curvature. Osteocyte apoptosis is also included to\ndistinguish between the density of osteocyte lacuna and the density of live\nosteocytes. Experimental measurements of osteocyte lacuna densities are used to\nestimate the rate of burial of osteoblasts in bone matrix. These results\nsuggest that: (i) burial rate decreases during osteonal infilling, and (ii) the\ncontrol of osteoblast burial by osteocytes is likely to emanate as a collective\nsignal from a large group of osteocytes, rather than from the osteocytes\nclosest to the bone deposition front.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 10:19:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 May 2014 12:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-15"}

First,\nthe excitation power is concentrated at a single frequency, allowing the\ncorresponding spin waves to propagate with very low attenuation, resulting in a\nhigher k-space resolution.

In our model, replication is initiated in an uncoordinated\n(time-stochastic) manner at well-defined sites.

It has,\nhowever, been suggested that W-R stars are indeed needed to explain the\nchemical evolution of F in the Bulge. The molecular spectral data of the often\nused HF-molecule has not been presented in a complete and consistent way and\nhas recently been debated in the literature. In this article we determine the\n[F/O] vs. [O/H] trend in the Bulge to investigate the possible contribution\nfrom W-R stars. Additionally, we present here a HF line list for the K- and\nL-bands (including the often used 23358.33 {\\AA} line) and an accompanying\npartition function. The F abundances were determined using spectral fitting\nfrom hi-res NIR spectra of eight K giants recorded by the spectrograph CRIRES.\nWe have also re-analyzed five previously published Bulge giants using our new\nHF molecular data. We find that the F-O abundance in the Bulge probably cannot\nbe explained with chemical evolution models including only AGB-stars and the\n{\\nu}-process in SNe Type II, i.e. a significant amount of F production in W-R\nstars is likely needed to explain the F abundance in the Bulge. Concerning the\nHF line list, we find that a possible reason for the inconsistencies in the\nliterature, with two different excitation energies being used, is two different\ndefinitions of the zero-point energy for the HF molecule and therefore also two\naccompanying different dissociation energies.

The LO pQCD\ncalculations are shown to give a reasonably good descritption of recent CMS and\nATLAS data on inclusive jet production and therefore this formalism can be used\nto reliably estimate the DPS effects. Relative contribution of DPS is growing\nat large rapidity distance between jets. This is consistent with our experience\nfrom previous studies of double-parton scattering effects in the case of open\nand hidden charm production.

This\nunderstanding has recently been challenged by an increasing number of\nobservations in uranium systems (UGe2, URhGe, UIr and UCoGe) in which\nsuperconductivity is found within a ferromagnetic state and, more\nfundamentally, both ordering phenomena are exhibited by the same set of heavy\n5f electrons. Since the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is\nat odds with the standard theory of phonon-mediated spin-singlet\nsuperconductivity, it requires an alternative pairing mechanism, in which\nelectrons are bound into spin-triplet pairs by spin fluctuations.
