Assume they select their\nseats uniformly and independently at random among the empty ones. A row of\nseats is narrow and an occupant who is already occupying a seat is blocking\npassage to new incoming theatregoers. As a consequence, occupying a specific\nseat depends on the courtesy of theatregoers and their willingness to get up so\nas to create free space that will allow passage to others. Thus, courtesy\nfacilitates and may well increase the overall seat occupancy of the theatre. We\nsay a theatregoer is courteous if (s)he will get up to let others pass.\nOtherwise, the theatregoer is selfish. A set of theatregoers is $p$-courteous\nif each theatregoer in the set is courteous with probability $p$, randomly and\nindependently. It is assumed that the behaviour of a theatregoer does not\nchange during the occupancy of the row.\n  In this paper, we are interested in the following question: what is the\nexpected number of occupied seats as a function of the total number of seats in\na theatre, $n$, and the probability that a theatregoer is courteous, $p$? We\nstudy and analyze interesting variants of this problem reflecting behaviour of\nthe theatregoers as entirely selfish, and $p$-courteous for a row of seats with\none or two entrances and as a consequence for a theatre with $m$ rows of seats\nwith multiple aisles. We also consider the case where seats in a row are chosen\naccording to the geometric distribution and the Zipf distibrution (as opposed\nto the uniform distribution) and provide bounds on the occupancy of a row (and\nthus the theatre) in each case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2014 17:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-11"}

Different\nphysical regimes refer to the ratio $L/\\tau$ between the longitudinal size $L$\nof the target and the lifetime $\\tau$ of the gluon fluctuations. When $L/\\tau\n\\ll 1$, meaning that the target can be effectively treated as a shockwave, we\nrecover the JIMWLK Hamiltonian, as expected. When $L/\\tau \\gg 1$, meaning that\nthe fluctuations live inside the target, the new Hamiltonian governs phenomena\nlike the transverse momentum broadening and the radiative energy loss, which\naccompany the propagation of an energetic parton through a dense QCD medium.\nUsing this Hamiltonian, we derive a non-linear equation for the dipole\namplitude (a generalization of the BK equation), which describes the\nhigh-energy evolution of jet quenching. As compared to the original BK-JIMWLK\nevolution, the new evolution is remarkably different: the plasma saturation\nmomentum evolves much faster with increasing energy (or decreasing Bjorken's\n$x$) than the corresponding scale for a shockwave (nucleus). This widely opens\nthe transverse phase-space for the evolution and implies the existence of large\nradiative corrections, enhanced by the double logarithm $\\ln^2(LT)$, with $T$\nthe temperature of the medium. This confirms and explains from a physical\nperspective a recent result by Liou, Mueller, and Wu (arXiv:1304.7677). The\ndominant corrections are smooth enough to be absorbed into a renormalization of\nthe jet quenching parameter $\\hat q$. This renormalization is controlled by a\nlinear equation supplemented with a saturation boundary, which emerges via\ncontrolled approximations from the generalized BK equation alluded to above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2014 18:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

For this study we\nused the techniques of Quantum Field Theory with Massive Scalar interactions of\ntype {\\lambda}{\\phi}^4 in order to obtain a perturbative expansion for the\ntwo-point vertex part up to the 3-loop order and four-point vertex function up\nto 2-loop level. These vertex functions were regularized using the method of\ndimensional regularization and renormalized using the minimal subtraction of\ndimensional poles method.In particular, counterterms have been added to the\noriginal Lagrangian, which is the main feature of the method BPHZ\n(Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann). Through the renormalization group ideas,\nwe defined the Wilson functions which shall produce nontrivial fixed points,\nand from these functions and fixed points, we calculate the anisotropic\ncritical exponents {\\eta}_{\\tau}, to the order of three in number loops, and\n{\\nu}_{\\tau} to the number of two in order loops, which characterize the\ncritical behavior of the Lifshitz type m-axial. The exponents calculated using\nthis technique are in perfect agreement with results obtained using other\nmethods, thus confirming the known and important hypothesis of universality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2014 18:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-11"}

In this attack the attacker tries\nto make a fake identity of a real user in order to access to private\ninformation of the users friends which they do not publish on the public\nprofiles. In today OSNs, there are some verification services, but they are not\nactive services and they are useful for users who are familiar with online\nidentity issues.

Each sensor connected to a central\nentity, known as the fusion center (FC), forms a linear combination of the\nobservations to which it has access and sends the resulting signal to the FC\nthrough an orthogonal fading channel. The FC combines these received signals to\nfind the best linear unbiased estimator of the vector of unknown signals\nobserved by individual sensors.

The disk mass upper limits for the undetected targets, which include\nOB stars, theta1Ori C and theta1Ori F, range from 0.1-0.6 Mjup.

At larger separations from theta1Ori C, in the far-UV dominated\nregion, there is a wide range of disk masses, similar to what is found in\nlow-mass star forming regions.

Here, we generalize it to the case of a nonlinear delayed carrying\ncapacity. The nonlinear functional form of the carrying capacity characterizes\nthe delayed feedback of the evolving population on the capacity of their\nsurrounding by either creating additional means for survival or destroying the\navailable resources. The previously studied linear approximation for the\ncapacity assumed weak feedback, while the nonlinear form is applicable to\narbitrarily strong feedback. The nonlinearity essentially changes the behavior\nof solutions to the evolution equation, as compared to the linear case.

In this\narticle we show that Bertrand's paradox contains two different problems: an\n\"easy\" problem and a \"hard\" problem. The easy problem can be solved by\nformulating Bertrand's question in sufficiently precise terms, so allowing for\na non ambiguous modelization of the entity subjected to the randomization. We\nthen show that once the easy problem is settled, also the hard problem becomes\nsolvable, provided Laplace's principle of insufficient reason is applied not to\nthe outcomes of the experiment, but to the different possible \"ways of\nselecting\" an interaction between the entity under investigation and that\nproducing the randomization. This consists in evaluating a huge average over\nall possible \"ways of selecting\" an interaction, which we call a 'universal\naverage'. Following a strategy similar to that used in the definition of the\nWiener measure, we calculate such universal average and therefore solve the\nhard problem of Bertrand's paradox. The link between Bertrand's problem of\nprobability theory and the measurement problem of quantum mechanics is also\nbriefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2014 19:31:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jun 2014 10:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-19"}
