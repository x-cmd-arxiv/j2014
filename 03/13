We use observations and simulations to demonstrate how LOS\ncontamination affects the column density probability distribution function\n(PDF). We apply a first-order approximation (removing a constant level) to the\nmolecular clouds of Auriga, Maddalena, Carina and NGC3603. In perfect agreement\nwith the simulations, we find that the PDFs become broader, the peak shifts to\nlower column densities, and the power-law tail of the PDF flattens after\ncorrection. All PDFs have a lognormal part for low column densities with a peak\nat Av~2, a deviation point (DP) from the lognormal at Av(DP)~4-5, and a\npower-law tail for higher column densities. Assuming a density distribution\nrho~r^-alpha, the slopes of the power-law tails correspond to alpha(PDF)=1.8,\n1.75, and 2.5 for Auriga, Carina, and NGC3603 (alpha~1.5-2 is consistent\ngravitational collapse). We find that low-mass and high-mass SF clouds display\ndifferences in the overall column density structure. Massive clouds assemble\nmore gas in smaller cloud volumes than low-mass SF ones. However, for both\ncloud types, the transition of the PDF from lognormal shape into power-law tail\nis found at the same column density (at Av~4-5 mag). Low-mass and high-mass SF\nclouds then have the same low column density distribution, most likely\ndominated by supersonic turbulence. At higher column densities, collapse and\nexternal pressure can form the power-law tail. The relative importance of the\ntwo processes can vary between clouds and thus lead to the observed differences\nin PDF and column density structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 16:04:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 17:39:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-04"}

Hereby, we present the results of the study\nof CoRoT 105906206, an eclipsing binary system with a pulsating component\nlocated in the CoRoT LRc02 field. The analysis of the CoRoT light curve was\ncomplemented by high-resolution spectra from the Sandiford at McDonald\nObservatory and FEROS at ESO spectrographs, which revealed a double-lined\nspectroscopic binary. We used an iterative procedure to separate the\npulsation-induced photometric variations from the eclipse signals. First, a\nFourier analysis was used to identify the significant frequencies and\namplitudes due to pulsations. Second, after removing the contribution of the\npulsations from the light curve we applied the PIKAIA genetic-algorithm\napproach to derive the best parameters that describe the orbital properties of\nthe system. The light curve cleaned for pulsations contains the partial eclipse\nof the primary and the total eclipse of the secondary.

One of the outstanding challenges facing geographic routing has been\nits applicability. Authors either make some broad assumptions on an idealized\nversion of wireless networks which are often unverifiable, or they use costly\nmethods to planarize the communication graph.\n  The overarching questions that drive us are the following. When, and how\nshould we use geographic routing? Is there a criterion to tell whether a\ncommunication network is fit for geographic routing? When exactly does\ngeographic routing make sense?\n  In this paper we formulate the four principles that define geographic routing\nand explore their topological consequences.

In this paper, a novel multiscale hierarchical approach including\nmicrofibril scale based on hybrid neural network computation and homogenisation\nequations was developed to link nanoscopic and macroscopic scales to estimate\nthe elastic properties of human cortical bone. The multiscale model is divided\ninto three main phases: (i) in step 0, the elastic constants of collagen-water\nand mineral-water composites are calculated by averaging the upper and lower\nHill bounds; (ii) in step 1, the elastic properties of the collagen microfibril\nare computed using a trained neural network simulation. Finite element (FE)\ncalculation is performed at nanoscopic levels to provide a database to train an\nin-house neural network program; (iii) in steps 2 to 10 from fibril to\ncontinuum cortical bone tissue, homogenisation equations are used to perform\nthe computation at the higher scales. The neural network outputs (elastic\nproperties of the microfibril) are used as inputs for the homogenisation\ncomputation to determine the properties of mineralised collagen fibril. The\nmechanical and geometrical properties of bone constituents (mineral, collagen\nand cross-links) as well as the porosity were taken in consideration. This\npaper aims to predict analytically the effective elastic constants of cortical\nbone by modelling its elastic response at these different scales, ranging from\nthe nanostructural to mesostructural levels. Our findings of the lowest scale's\noutput were well integrated with the other higher levels and serve as inputs\nfor the next higher scale modelling. Good agreement was obtained between our\npredicted results and literature data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 16:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-13"}

We study the\neffects of particle acceleration and escape by implementing a two-zone model in\norder to assess the production of high-energy neutrinos in GRBs associated with\ntheir prompt emission. Both primary relativistic electrons and protons are\ninjected in a zone where an acceleration mechanism operates and dominates over\nthe losses.

The distribution\nof these secondary pions and the decaying muons are also computed in both\nzones, from which the neutrino output is obtained.

We first set up the\nrecurrence formula of one-dimensional (1D) Legendre moments by using the\nrecursive property of Legendre polynomials. As a result, the 1D Legendre\nmoments of order p, Lp = Lp(0), can be expressed as a linear combination of\nLp-1(1) and Lp-2(0).

To further decrease the computation complexity, an algorithm, in\nwhich no multiplication is required, is used to compute these quantities.

Such parameterization\nsupports the idea, previously suggested, that both Eulerian and Lagrangian data\nare consistent with a linear scaling plus finite-Reynolds number effects\naffecting the small- and large-time scales. When large-time saturation effects\nare properly accounted for, compensated plots show a detectable plateau already\nat the available Reynolds number. Furthermore, this parameterization allows us\nto make quantitative predictions on the Reynolds number value for which\nLagrangian structure functions are expected to display a scaling region.\nFinally, we show that this is also sufficient to predict the anomalous\ndependency of the normalized root mean squared acceleration as a function of\nthe Reynolds number, without fitting parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 16:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-13"}

We first derive a novel outer bound and two inner bounds which\nare based on a careful use of each of the available cooperative strategies\ntogether with the adequate interference decoding technique. The outer bound\nextends Telatar and Tse's work while the inner bounds contain several known\nresults in the literature as special cases. Our main result is the\ncharacterization of the capacity region of the Gaussian class of IRCs studied\nwithin a fixed number of bits per dimension -constant gap. The proof relies on\nthe use of the different cooperative strategies in specific SNR regimes due to\nthe complexity of the schemes. As a matter of fact, this issue reveals the\ncomplex nature of the Gaussian IRC where the combination of a single coding\nscheme for the Gaussian relay and interference channel may not lead to a good\ncoding scheme for this problem, even when the focus is only on capacity to\nwithin a constant gap over all possible fading statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 17:18:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 17:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

Although they lie close to the star, several\nhave finite eccentricities and significant misalignment angle with respect to\nthe stellar equator.\n  Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the excited and misaligned\nsub-population of HJs: Lidov-Kozai migration and planet-planet scattering.\nAlthough both are based on completely different dynamical phenomena, they\nappear to be equally effective in generating hot planets. Nevertheless, there\nhas been no detailed analysis comparing the predictions of both mechanisms.\n  In this paper we present numerical simulations of Lidov-Kozai trapping of\nsingle planets in compact binary systems. Both the planet and the binary are\ninitially placed in coplanar orbits, although the inclination of the impactor\nis assumed random. After the passage of the third star, we follow the orbital\nand spin evolution of the planet using analytical models based on the octupole\nexpansion of the secular Hamiltonian.\n  The present work aims at the comparison of the two mechanisms, as an\nexplanation for the excited and inclined HJs in binary systems. We compare the\nresults obtained through this paper with results in Beaug\\'e & Nesvorn\\'y 2012,\nwhere the authors analyze how the planet-planet scattering mechanisms works.\n  Several of the orbital characteristics of the simulated HJs are caused by\ntidal trapping from quasi-parabolic orbits, independent of the driving\nmechanism. These include both the 3-day pile-up and the distribution in the\neccentricity vs semimajor axis plane. However, the distribution of the\ninclinations shows significant differences. While Lidov-Kozai trapping favors a\nmore random distribution, planet-planet scattering shows a large portion of\nbodies nearly aligned with the equator of the central star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 18:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-16"}

At z = 0, our computational volume contains 1788 clusters with mass\nM_cl > 1.1x10^12 Msun, including 18 massive clusters with M_cl > 10^14 Msun. It\nalso contains 1 088 797 galaxies with mass M_gal > 2x10^9 Msun and luminosity L\n> 9.5x10^5 Lsun. For each cluster, we identified the brightest cluster galaxy\n(BCG). We then computed the fraction f_BNC of clusters in which the BCG is not\nthe closest galaxy to the center of the cluster in projection, and the ratio\nDv/s, where Dv is the difference in radial velocity between the BCG and the\nwhole cluster, and s is the radial velocity dispersion of the cluster. f_BNC\nincreases from 0.05 for low-mass clusters (M_cl ~ 10^12 Msun) to 0.5 for\nhigh-mass ones (M_cl > 10^14 Msun), with no dependence on cluster redshift. The\nvalues of Dv/s vary from 0 to 1.8. These results are consistent with previous\nobservational studies, and indicate that the central galaxy paradigm, which\nstates that the BCG should be at rest at the center of the cluster, is usually\nvalid, but exceptions are too common to be ignored.

We found evidence that these mergers are responsible for the off-center\npositions and peculiar velocities of some BCGs. Our results thus support the\nmerging-group scenario, in which some clusters form by the merger of smaller\ngroups in which the galaxies have already formed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 18:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The parent sample, selected to be faint or\nundetected in the WISE 3.4um (W1) and 4.6um (W2) bands but bright at 12um (W3)\nand 22um (W4), are extremely rare, with only ~1000 so-called W1W2-dropouts\nacross the extragalactic sky. Optical spectroscopy reveals typical redshifts of\nz~2 for this population, implying rest-frame mid-IR luminosities of L(6um)~6e46\nerg/s and bolometric luminosities that can exceed L(bol)~1e14 L(sun). The\ncorresponding intrinsic, unobscured hard X-ray luminosities are L(2-10)~4e45\nerg/s for typical quasar templates. These are amongst the most luminous AGN\nknown, though the optical spectra rarely show evidence of a broad-line region\nand the selection criteria imply heavy obscuration even at rest-frame 1.5um.

Workers will be paid for each label they provide, but\nthe labeling requester usually has only a limited amount of the budget.

We consider categorical labeling tasks and formulate the\nbudget allocation problem as a Bayesian Markov decision process (MDP), which\nsimultaneously conducts learning and decision making. Using the dynamic\nprogramming (DP) recurrence, one can obtain the optimal allocation policy.\nHowever, DP quickly becomes computationally intractable when the size of the\nproblem increases.

Although highly uncertain, we derive mass outflow rates (typically ~10x\nthe SFRs), kinetic energies (~0.5-10% of L[AGN]) and momentum rates (typically\n>~10-20x L[AGN]/c) consistent with theoretical models that predict AGN-driven\noutflows play a significant role in shaping the evolution of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Apr 2014 09:04:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 May 2014 08:49:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

For typical ground-based adaptive\noptics (AO) or space-based observations, this requires either inordinately long\ntime baselines or high relative proper motions. We provide a list of\nmicrolensing events toward the Galactic Bulge with high relative lens-source\nproper motion that are therefore good candidates for constraining the lens mass\nwith future high-resolution imaging.

The couplings considered here are primarily used in a\ncomputational framework by providing reductions in variance for different Monte\nCarlo estimators, thereby allowing for significantly more accurate results for\na fixed amount of computational time. Common applications of the couplings\ninclude the estimation of parametric sensitivities via finite difference\nmethods and the estimation of expectations via multi-level Monte Carlo\nalgorithms. While a number of coupling strategies have been proposed for the\nmodels considered here, and a number of articles have experimentally compared\nthe different strategies, to date there has been no mathematical analysis\ndescribing the connections between them. Such analyses are critical in order to\ndetermine the best use for each. In the current paper, we show a connection\nbetween the common reaction path (CRP) method and the split coupling (SC)\nmethod, which is termed coupled finite differences (CFD) in the parametric\nsensitivities literature. In particular, we show that the two couplings are\nboth limits of a third coupling strategy we call the \"local-CRP\" coupling, with\nthe split coupling method arising as a key parameter goes to infinity, and the\ncommon reaction path coupling arising as the same parameter goes to zero.

We compiled 233\nseparate LMC distance determinations published between 1990 and 2013. Our\nanalysis of the individual distance moduli, as well as of their two-year means\nand standard deviations resulting from this largest data set of LMC distance\nmoduli available to date, focuses specifically on Cepheid and RR Lyrae\nvariable-star tracer populations, as well as on distance estimates based on\nfeatures in the observational Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We conclude that\nstrong publication bias is unlikely to have been the main driver of the\nmajority of published LMC distance moduli. However, for a given distance\ntracer, the body of publications leading to the tightly clustered distances is\nbased on highly non-independent tracer samples and analysis methods, hence\nleading to significant correlations among the LMC distances reported in\nsubsequent articles. Based on a careful, weighted combination, in a statistical\nsense, of the main stellar population tracers, we recommend that a slightly\nadjusted canonical distance modulus of (m-M)_0 = 18.49 +- 0.09 mag be used for\nall practical purposes that require a general distance scale without the need\nfor accuracies of better than a few percent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 01:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

For group IVB TMDCs\n(TiX2, ZrX2, HfX2), the bandgap increases with the tensile strain, but for ZrX2\nand HfX2 (X=S, Se), the bandgap starts to decrease at strain 6% to 8%.

We find that the BN monolayer is the\nmost effective sheet to decouple the interlayer vdW coupling of the MoS2\nbilayer, and the resulting sandwich trilayer can recover the electronic\nstructures of the MoS2 monolayer, particularly the direct-gap character.\nFurther study of the MoS2/BN superlattices confirms the effectiveness of the BN\nmonolayer for the decoupling of the MoS2-MoS2 interaction. In addition, the\nintercalation of transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) MoSe2 or WSe2 sheet\nrenders the sandwich trilayer undergoing an indirect-gap to direct-gap\ntransition due to the newly formed heterogeneous S/Se interfaces. In contrast,\nthe MoS2/WS2/MoS2 sandwich trilayer still retains the indirect-gap character of\nthe MoS2 bilayer due to the lack of the heterogeneous S/Se interfaces.\nMoreover, the 3D superlattice of the MoS2/TMDC heterostructures also exhibits\nsimilar electronic band characters as the MoS2/TMDC/MoS2 trilayer\nheterostructures, albeit slight decrease of the bandgap than the trilayers.\nCompared to the bulk MoS2, the 3D MoS2/TMDC superlattice can give rise to new\nand distinctive properties. Our study offers not only new insights into\nelectronic properties of the vdW multilayer heterostructures but also guidance\nin designing new heterostructures to modify electronic structures of 2D TMDC\ncrystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 07:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

Both stars are known to\nhave near-edge on accretion disks. A summary of these first X-shooter\nobservations of jets was given in a 2011 letter. The new results outlined here\ninclude flux tables of identified emission lines, information on the\nmorphology, kinematics and physical conditions of both jets and, updated\nestimates of $\\dot{M}_{out}$ / $\\dot{M}_{acc}$. Asymmetries in the \\eso flow\nare investigated while the \\para jet is much more symmetric. The density,\ntemperature, and therefore origin of the gas traced by the Balmer lines are\ninvestigated from the Balmer decrements and results suggest an origin in a jet\nfor \\eso while for \\para the temperature and density are consistent with an\naccretion flow. $\\dot{M}_{acc}$ is estimated from the luminosity of various\naccretion tracers. For both targets, new luminosity relationships and a\nre-evaluation of the effect of reddening and grey extinction (due to the\nedge-on disks) allows for substantial improvements on previous estimates of\n$\\dot{M}_{acc}$. It is found that log($\\dot{M}_{acc}$) = -9.15 $\\pm$ 0.45~\\Msun\nyr$^{-1}$ and -9.30 $\\pm$ 0.27~\\Msun yr$^{-1}$ for \\eso and \\para respectively.\nAdditionally, the physical conditions in the jets (electron density, electron\ntemperature, and ionisation) are probed using various line ratios and compared\nwith previous determinations from iron lines. The results are combined with the\nluminosity of the [SII]$\\lambda$6731 line to derive $\\dot{M}_{out}$ through a\ncalculation of the gas emissivity based on a 5-level atom model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 11:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-14"}

Different outcomes are observed\ndepending on the predator strength. For a \"weak\" predator, the swarm is able to\nescape the predator completely. As the strength is increased, the predator is\nable to catch up with the swarm as a whole, but the individual prey are able to\nescape by \"confusing\" the predator: the prey forms a ring with the predator at\nthe center. For higher predator strength, complex chasing dynamics are observed\nwhich can become chaotic. For even higher strength, the predator is able to\nsuccessfully capture the prey. Our model is simple enough to be amenable to a\nfull mathematical analysis which is used to predict the shape of the swarm as\nwell as the resulting predator-prey dynamics as a function of model parameters.\nWe show that as the predator strength is increased, there is a transition (due\nto a Hopf bifurcation) from confusion state to chasing dynamics, and we compute\nthe threshold analytically. Our analysis indicates that the swarming behaviour\nis not helpful in avoiding the predator, suggesting that there are other\nreasons why the species may swarm. The complex shape of the swarm in our model\nduring the chasing dynamics is similar to the shape of a flock of sheep\navoiding a shepherd.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 12:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

The following features in the motion of a distributed charge are\nstressed: each point of the charge is a center from which elements of the\ncharge propagate with the same velocity within the solid angle $2\\pi$. The set\nof spherical functions needed to describe a distributed charge is specified,\nand it is shown that a charge cannot have spherical symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 14:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

The configuration is of a thin dielectric film\ncoated by stretchable electrodes at both sides. The film is first stretched,\nthen charged and subsequently, afterwards it is released, and finally the\ncharge is harvested at a higher electric potential. The amount of energy\nextracted by this cycle is bounded by the electric breakdown and the ultimate\nstretch ratio of the film as well as by structural instabilities due to loss of\ntension. To identify the optimal cycle that complies with these limits we\nformulate a constraint optimization problem and solve it with a dedicated\nsolver for two typical classes of elastic dielectrics. As anticipated, we find\nthat the performance of the generator depends critically on the ultimate\nstretch ratio of the film. However, more surprising is our finding of a\nuniversal limit on the dielectric strength of the film beyond which the optimal\ncycle is independent of this parameter. Thus, we reveal that, regardless of how\nlarge the dielectric strength of the material is, there is an upper bound on\nthe amount of harvested energy that depends only on the ultimate stretch ratio.\nWe conclude the work with detailed calculations of the optimal cycles for two\ncommercially available elastic dielectrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 14:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

There are two\nprincipal reasons for doing so. One has to do with the fundamental physical\ninterest in the characteristics of a free neutron as a quantum object while the\nother is of a more practical nature, relating to the understanding of how to\ninterpret elastic scattering data when the neutron is employed as a probe of\ncondensed matter structure on an atomic or nanometer scale. Knowing such a\nbasic physical characteristic as the neutron's effective transverse coherence\ncan dictate how to properly analyze specular reflectivity data obtained for\nmaterial film structures possessing some amount of in-plane inhomogeneity. In\nthis study we describe a means of measuring the effective transverse coherence\nlength of the neutron wave packet by specular reflection from a series of\ndiffraction gratings of different spacings. Complementary non-specular\nmeasurements of the widths of grating reflections were also performed which\ncorroborate the specular results. (Part I principally describes measurements\ninterpreted according to the theoretical picture presented in Part II.) Each\ngrating was fabricated by lift-off photo-lithography patterning of a nickel\nfilm (approximately 1000 Angstroms thick) formed by physical vapor deposition\non a flat silicon crystal surface. The grating periods ranged from 10 microns\n(5 microns Ni stripe, 5 microns intervening space) to several hundred microns.\nThe transverse coherence length, modeled as the width of the wave packet, was\ndetermined from an analysis of the specular reflectivity curves of the set of\ngratings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 23:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We analyze the applicability\nof QM to two basic properties in opinion polling. The first property (response\nreplicability) is that, for a large class of questions, a response to a given\nquestion is expected to be repeated if the question is posed again,\nirrespective of whether another question is asked and answered in between. The\nsecond property (question order effect) is that the response probabilities\nfrequently depend on the order in which the questions are asked. Whenever these\ntwo properties occur together, it poses a problem for QM. The conventional QM\nwith Hermitian operators can handle response replicability, but only in the way\nincompatible with the question order effect. In the generalization of QM known\nas theory of positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs), in order to account for\nresponse replicability, the POVMs involved must be conventional operators.\nAlthough these problems are not unique to QM and also challenge conventional\ncognitive theories, they stand out as important unresolved problems for the\napplication of QM to cognition . Either some new principles are needed to\ndetermine the bounds of applicability of QM to cognition, or quantum formalisms\nmore general than POVMs are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 22:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}
