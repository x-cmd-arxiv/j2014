Here we present the interesting case of the\nSaturn-mass planet HAT-P-18b, which orbits one of the coolest stars for which\nthe Rossiter-McLaughlin effect has been measured so far. We acquired a\nspectroscopic time-series, spanning a full transit, with the HARPS-N\nspectrograph mounted at the TNG telescope. The very precise radial velocity\nmeasurements delivered by the HARPS-N pipeline were used to measure the\nRossiter-McLaughlin effect. Complementary new photometric observations of\nanother full transit were also analysed to obtain an independent determination\nof the star and planet parameters. We find that HAT-P-18b lies on a\ncounter-rotating orbit, the sky-projected angle between the stellar spin axis\nand the planet orbital axis being lambda=132 +/- 15 deg. By joint modelling of\nthe radial velocity and photometric data we obtain new determinations of the\nstar (M_star = 0.770 +/- 0.027 M_Sun; R_star= 0.717 +/- 0.026 R_Sun;\nVsin(I_star) = 1.58 +/- 0.18 km/s) and planet (M_pl = 0.196 +/- 0.008 M_J; R_pl\n= 0.947 +/- 0.044 R_J) parameters.

HAT-P-18b\nis one of the few planets known to transit a star with T_eff < 6250 K on a\nretrograde orbit. Objects such as HAT-P-18b (low planet mass and/or relatively\nlong orbital period) most likely have a weak tidal coupling with their parent\nstars, therefore their orbits preserve any original misalignment.

In this case, the primordial gravitational wave amplitude is\nnegligible, so that there is no tension with Planck and no problems posed for\ncurrent inflationary models. However, the simplest magnetic model is in tension\nwith Planck limits on non-Gaussianity in the trispectrum. It may be possible to\nfine-tune the magnetogenesis model so that this non-Gaussianity is suppressed.\nAlternatively, a weaker magnetic field can pass the non-Gaussianity constraints\nand allow the primordial tensor mode to be reduced to r~0.09, thus removing the\ntension with Planck data and alleviating the problems with simple inflationary\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 17:48:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Mar 2014 16:18:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 16:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-20"}

Here, we present a\nthorough statistical analysis of the spin distributions of the various classes\nof millisecond pulsars to assess the evolution of their spin period between the\ndifferent stages. Accreting sources that showed oscillations exclusively during\nthermonuclear type I X-ray bursts (nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars) are\nfound to be significantly faster than rotation-powered sources, while accreting\nsources that possess a magnetosphere and show coherent pulsations (accreting\nmillisecond pulsars) are not. On the other hand, if accreting millisecond\npulsars and eclipsing rotation-powered millisecond pulsars form a common class\nof transitional pulsars, these are shown to have a spin distribution\nintermediate between the faster nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars and the\nslower non-eclipsing rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. We interpret these\nfindings in terms of a spin-down due to the decreasing mass-accretion rate\nduring the latest stages of the accretion phase, and in terms of the different\norbital evolutionary channels mapped by the various classes of pulsars. We\nsummarize possible instrumental selection effects, showing that even if an\nunbiased sample of pulsars is still lacking, their influence on the results of\nthe presented analysis is reduced by recent improvements in instrumentation and\nsearching techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 18:09:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 May 2014 14:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We have found frictional contact forces\nto be essential, and were able to reproduce the experimental behavior by a\nsimulation including this physical ingredient along with viscous lubrication.\nIn the present article, we thoroughly investigate the effect of friction and\nexpress it in the framework of the jamming transition. The viscosity divergence\nat the jamming transition has been a well known phenomenon in suspension\nrheology, as reflected in many empirical laws for the viscosity. Friction can\naffect this divergence, and in particular the jamming packing fraction is\nreduced if particles are frictional. Within the physical description proposed\nhere, shear thickening is a direct consequence of this effect: as the shear\nrate increases, friction is increasingly incorporated as more contacts form,\nleading to a transition from a mostly frictionless to a mostly frictional\nrheology. This result is significant because it shifts the emphasis from\nlubrication hydrodynamics and detailed microscopic interactions to geometry and\nsteric constraints close to the jamming transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 19:07:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 18:44:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Jun 2014 20:47:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 15:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-25"}

Since each action can be\ndistinguished by their unique trajectories within this space, the trajectory\npoint cloud is used to define an adaptive distance metric for classifying\nqueries against stored actions. Depending upon the distance to other\ntrajectories, the distance metric uses either large scale structure of the\ntrajectory point cloud, such as the mean distance between cloud centroids or\nthe difference in hyperplane orientation, or small structure such as the time\naveraged curvature and torsion, to classify individual points in a fuzzy-KNN.\nOur system can function in real-time and has an accuracy greater than 93% for\nmultiple action recognition within video repositories.

It\nis by now well-known that this puts stringent constraints on the sequestered\nLarge Volume Scenario (LVS), i.e. on LVS realisations with the Standard Model\nat a singularity. We go beyond this setting by considering LVS models where SM\nfields are realised on 7-branes in the geometric regime. As we argue, this\nnaturally goes together with high-scale supersymmetry. The abundance of Dark\nRadiation is determined by the competition between the decay of the lightest\nmodulus to axions, to the SM Higgs and to gauge fields. The latter decay\nchannel avoids the most stringent constraints of the sequestered setting.\nNevertheless, a rather robust prediction for a substantial amount of Dark\nRadiation can be made. This applies both to cases where the SM 4-cycles are\nstabilised by D-terms and are small \"by accident\" as well as to fibred models\nwith the small cycles stabilised by loops. Furthermore, we analyse a closely\nrelated setting where the SM lives at a singularity but couples to the volume\nmodulus through flavour branes. We conclude that some of the most natural LVS\nsettings with natural values of model parameters lead to Dark Radiation\npredictions just below the present observational limits. Barring a discovery,\nrather modest improvements of present Dark Radiation bounds can rule out many\nof these most simple and generic variants of the LVS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 19:44:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 May 2014 15:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

We shed light on this issue with\nan empirical approach based on a z~0 reference sample built from ~300,000 SDSS\ngalaxies, from which we mimic selection effects due to typical emission line\ndetection limits at higher redshift. We combine this low-redshift reference\nsample with a simple prescription for luminosity evolution of the global galaxy\npopulation to predict the loci of high-redshift galaxies on the BPT and\nMass-Excitation (MEx) diagnostic diagrams.

The most\nactive and popular social media users are often the ones that are overloaded.\nMoreover, we find that the rate at which users receive information impacts\ntheir processing behavior, including how they prioritize information from\ndifferent sources, how much information they process, and how quickly they\nprocess information. Finally, the susceptibility of a social media user to\nsocial contagions depends crucially on the rate at which she receives\ninformation. An exposure to a piece of information, be it an idea, a convention\nor a product, is much less effective for users that receive information at\nhigher rates, meaning they need more exposures to adopt a particular contagion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 20:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-28"}

For this reason, we\nselected 10 massive ($\\sigma$ > 200 km/s) nearby (d < 31 Mpc) galaxies and\nobserved them with the IFU/GMOS (integral field unit/Gemini Multi-Object\nSpectrograph) spectrograph on the Gemini South Telescope. The data were\nanalysed with principal component analysis (PCA) Tomography to assess the main\nproperties of the objects. Two spectral regions were analysed: a yellow region\n(5100-5800 A), adequate to show the properties of the stellar component, and a\nred region (6250-6800 A), adequate to analyse the gaseous component. We found\nthat all objects previously known to present emission lines have a central\nAGN-type emitting source. They also show gaseous and stellar kinematics typical\nof discs.

An FFP\nis a unique alternative to a traditional etalon, as the interferometric cavity\nis made of single-mode fiber rather than an air-gap spacer. This design allows\nfor excellent collimation, high spectral finesse, rigid mechanical stability,\ninsensitivity to vibrations, and no need for vacuum operation.

A 20ks Chandra HRC-I observation of HR 4796A, an 8 Myr old main\nsequence A0 star devoid of close stellar companions, has been used to search\nfor a signature or remnant of magnetic activity from the Herbig Ae phase.\nX-rays were not detected and the X-ray luminosity upper limit was L_X =<\n1.3x10^27 erg/s. The result is discussed in the context of various scenarios\nfor generating magnetic activity, including rotational shear and subsurface\nconvection. A dynamo driven by natal differential rotation is unlikely to\nproduce observable X rays, chiefly because of the difficulty in getting the\ndissipated energy up to the surface of the star. A subsurface convection layer\nproduced by the ionisation of helium could host a dynamo that should be\neffective throughout the main-sequence but can only produce X-ray luminosities\nof order 10^25 erg/s. This luminosity lies only moderately below the current\ndetection limit for Vega. Our study supports the idea that X-ray production in\nHerbig Ae/Be stars is linked largely to the accretion process rather than the\nproperties of the underlying star, and that early A stars generally decline in\nX-ray luminosity at least 100,000 fold in only a few million years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 21:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The modelling scenario is that of a real urban environment, when the\ncellular network is congested during an unexpected event, such as a terrorist\nattack.

We demonstrate that the electric field\ncomponent perpendicular to the axis of the CNT activates spin transitions which\nare otherwise absent and that the resonant spin-flip time scales with the\ninverse of the electric field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 10:28:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Mar 2014 09:15:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 08:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-04"}

In this paper, we focus on how to maximize the utility in\nphysical layer for an uplink multi-user multiple-input multipleoutput (MU-MIMO)\nsystem, where we will not only consider EE-SE tradeoff in a unified way, but\nalso ensure user fairness. We first formulate the utility maximization problem,\nbut it turns out to be non-convex. By exploiting the structure of this problem,\nwe find a convexization procedure to convert the original nonconvex problem\ninto an equivalent convex problem, which has the same global optimum with the\noriginal problem. Following the convexization procedure, we present a\ncentralized algorithm to solve the utility maximization problem, but it\nrequires the global information of all users. Thus we propose a primal-dual\ndistributed algorithm which does not need global information and just consumes\na small amount of overhead. Furthermore, we have proved that the distributed\nalgorithm can converge to the global optimum.

Those environments are thought to be very turbulent due to\ndynamic phenomena such as outflows and high supernova rates. We investigate the\neffect of mechanical heating (MH) on atomic fine-structure and molecular lines,\nand their ratios. We use those ratios as a diagnostic to constrain the amount\nof MH in an object and also study its significance on estimating the H2 mass.\nEquilibrium PDRs models were used to compute the thermal and chemical balance\nfor the clouds. The equilibria were solved for numerically using the optimized\nversion of the Leiden PDR-XDR code. Large velocity gradient calculations were\ndone as post-processing on the output of the PDR models using RADEX. High-J CO\nline ratios are very sensitive to MH. Emission becomes at least one order of\nmagnitude brighter in clouds with n~10^5~cm^-3 and a star formation rate of 1\nSolar Mass per year (corresponding to a MH rate of 2 * 10^-19 erg cm^-3 s^-1).\nEmission of low-J CO lines is not as sensitive to MH, but they do become\nbrighter in response to MH. Generally, for all of the lines we considered, MH\nincreases excitation temperatures and decreases the optical depth at the line\ncentre. Hence line ratios are also affected, strongly in some cases. Ratios\ninvolving HCN are a good diagnostic for MH, such as HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0) and\nHCN(1-0)/HCO^+(1-0). Both ratios increase by a factor 3 or more for a MH\nequivalent to > 5 percent of the surface heating, as opposed to pure PDRs. The\nfirst major conclusion is that low-J to high-J intensity ratios will yield a\ngood estimate of the MH rate (as opposed to only low-J ratios). The second one\nis that the MH rate should be taken into account when determining A_V or\nequivalently N_H, and consequently the cloud mass.

A Bayesian analysis, assuming that all host\nstars have equal probability to host a planet with the measured mass ratio\nimplies a host star mass of M_h = 0.37_{-0.17}^{+0.30} M_Sun and a companion of\nmass M_P = 4.6^{+3.7}_{-2.2} M_Jup, at a projected separation of r_proj =\n1.70^{+0.29}_{-0.30} AU.

So, if\nthe core accretion model prediction is right, we should expect that follow-up\nhigh angular resolution observations will detect a host star with a mass in the\nupper part of the range allowed by the Bayesian analysis. That is, the host\nwould probably be a K or G dwarf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 12:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We also derive rates in sup-norm in terms of the\nrate of convergence in $\\ell_1$-norm. The irrepresentable condition on a set\n$J$ requires that the $\\ell_1$-norm of the worst possible sub-direction is\nsufficiently smaller than one. In that case sharp oracle results can be\nobtained. Moreover, if the coefficients in $J$ are small enough the Lasso will\nput these coefficients to zero. This extends known results which say that the\nirrepresentable condition on the inactive set (the set where coefficients are\nexactly zero) implies no false positives. We further show that by\nde-sparsifying one obtains fast rates in supremum norm without conditions on\nthe worst possible sub-direction.

Compared to\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM+$r$ model, there are two extra parameters, $N_{\\rm eff}$ and\n$m_{\\nu,{\\rm sterile}}^{\\rm eff}$, in the $\\Lambda$CDM+$r$+$\\nu_s$ model. We\nshow that in this model the tension between Planck and BICEP2 can be greatly\nrelieved at the cost of the increase of $n_s$. However, comparing with the\n$\\Lambda$CDM+$r$+$dn_s/d\\ln k$ model that can significantly reduce the tension\nbetween Planck and BICEP2 but also makes trouble to inflation due to the large\nrunning of the spectral index of order $10^{-2}$ produced, the\n$\\Lambda$CDM+$r$+$\\nu_s$ model is much better for inflation.

More specifically, we determine how accurately and precisely\nthe parameters of the ionization zone can be obtained from the oscillation\nfrequencies of stellar models. We use models produced by three different\ngeneration codes that not only cover a wide range of stages of evolution along\nthe red giant phase but also incorporate different initial helium abundances.\nWe discuss the conditions under which such fits robustly and accurately\ndetermine the acoustic radius of the second ionization zone of helium. The\ndetermined radii of the ionization zones as inferred from the mode frequencies\nwere found to be coincident with the local maximum in the first adiabatic\nexponent described by the models, which is associated with the outer edge of\nthe second ionization zone of helium. Finally, we consider whether this method\ncan be used to distinguish stars with different helium abundances. Although a\ndefinite trend in the amplitude of the signal is observed any distinction would\nbe difficult unless the stars come from populations with vastly different\nhelium abundances or the uncertainties associated with the fitted parameters\ncan be reduced. However, application of our methodology could be useful for\ndistinguishing between different populations of red giant stars in globular\nclusters, where distinct populations with very different helium abundances have\nbeen observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 14:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We also identify\npreviously unknown companions to two of the three O-type members of NGC 3324\nand detect diffuse X-ray emission in the region. Our results suggests that the\nobserved region contains about 4000 young stars in total.

Assuming\nthe initial uniform density and Maxwellian distribution of DM velocities, we\nfind that the number $n(r)$ of DM particles within the radius $r$ scales like\n$n(r) \\propto r^{1.5}$, leading to the DM density profile $\\rho\\propto\nr^{-1.5}$, in agreement with the Liouville theorem and previous numerical\nstudies. At the same time, the number of DM particles $\\nu(r)$ with periastra\nsmaller than $r$ is parametrically larger, $\\nu(r) \\propto r$, implying that\nmany particles contributing at any given moment into the density $\\rho(r)$ at\nsmall $r$ have very elongated orbits and spend most of their time at distances\nlarger than $r$. This has implications for the capture of DM by stars in the\nprocess of their formation. As a concrete example we consider the case of\nprimordial black holes (PBH). We show that accounting for very eccentric orbits\nboosts the amount of captured PBH by a factor of up to $2\\times 10^3$ depending\non the PBH mass, improving correspondingly the previously derived constraints\non the PBH abundance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2014 15:48:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Oct 2014 21:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-15"}
