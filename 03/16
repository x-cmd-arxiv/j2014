Often referred to as\n``temperature-2'' systems, those which employ cooperation are known to be quite\npowerful (i.e. they are computationally universal and can build an enormous\nvariety of shapes and structures). Conversely, aTAM systems which do not\nenforce cooperative behavior, a.k.a. ``temperature-1'' systems, are conjectured\nto be relatively very weak, likely to be unable to perform complex computations\nor algorithmically direct the process of self-assembly. Nonetheless, a variety\nof models based on slight modifications to the aTAM have been developed in\nwhich temperature-1 systems are in fact capable of Turing universal computation\nthrough a restricted notion of cooperation. Despite that power, though, several\nof those models have previously been proven to be unable to perform or simulate\nthe stronger form of cooperation exhibited by temperature-2 aTAM systems.\n  In this paper, we first prove that another model in which temperature-1\nsystems are computationally universal, namely the restricted glue TAM (rgTAM)\nin which tiles are allowed to have edges which exhibit repulsive forces, is\nalso unable to simulate the strongly cooperative behavior of the temperature-2\naTAM. We then show that by combining the properties of two such models, the\nDupled Tile Assembly Model (DTAM) and the rgTAM into the DrgTAM, we derive a\nmodel which is actually more powerful at temperature-1 than the aTAM at\ntemperature-2. Specifically, the DrgTAM, at temperature-1, can simulate any\naTAM system of any temperature, and it also contains systems which cannot be\nsimulated by any system in the aTAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Mar 2014 18:41:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-18"}

The goal of the calculations is\ntwofold - to test the adequacy and the accuracy of the MCDCC model for the\nheavier projectiles, and to study the contribution of various channels to the\nelastic scattering cross sections.\n  Methods: The elastic scattering cross sections are calculated using the MCDCC\nmethod. The nucleon-target optical potential is folded with the projectile\ndensities resulting from an effective NN interaction, which includes central\nnuclear, spin-orbit and Coulomb terms. Discretization of the continuum is\nachieved via the pseudo state method. Coupled equations are solved using the\nR-matrix method on a Lagrange mesh.\n  Results: For the test case of 17F at 10 MeV/nucleon, the cross sections are\nweakly sensitive to the choice of the effective NN interaction, three different\nenergy dependent optical nucleon-target potentials provide a similar reasonable\nagreement with data.

We perform detailed X-ray point\nsource detection and photometry, and interpret the point source population by\nmeans of simulated hardness ratios. We thus estimate X-ray luminosities ($L_X$)\nfor all sources, most of which are too weak for reliable spectral fitting. For\nall sources, we provide catalogs with counts, count rates, power-law indices\n($\\Gamma$), hardness ratios, and $L_X$, in the full ($0.5-8.0$ keV), soft\n($0.5-2.0$ keV) and hard ($2.0-8.0$ keV) bands. We use optical emission-line\nratios from the literature to re-classify 24 galaxies as star-forming,\naccreting onto a supermassive black hole (AGNs), transition objects, or\nlow-ionization nuclear emission regions (LINERs). Two-thirds of our galaxies\nhave nuclear X-ray sources with $Swift$/UVOT counterparts. Two nuclei have\n$L_{X,{\\rm 0.5-8.0 keV}}$~$ > 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, are strong\nmulti-wavelength AGNs and follow the known $\\alpha_{\\rm OX}-\\nu L_{\\nu,\\rm near\nUV}$ correlation for strong AGNs. Otherwise, most nuclei are X-ray faint,\nconsistent with either a low-luminosity AGN or a nuclear X-ray binary\npopulation, and fall in the \"non-AGN locus\" in $\\alpha_{\\rm OX}-\\nu L_{\\nu,\\rm\nnear UV}$ space, which also hosts other, normal, galaxies. Our results suggest\nthat HCG X-ray nuclei in high specific star formation rate spiral galaxies are\nlikely dominated by star formation, while those with low specific star\nformation rates in earlier types likely harbor a weak AGN. The AGN fraction in\nHCG galaxies with $M_R \\le -20$ and $L_{X,{\\rm 0.5-8.0 keV}} \\ge 10^{41}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ is $0.08^{+0.35}_{-0.01}$, somewhat higher than the $\\sim 5%$ fraction\nin galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Mar 2014 22:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The generalized shear\nterm represents the particles' memory of the spatial flow velocity difference\nacross the particle distance in the past, while the acceleration term is\nassociated with the temporal flow velocity difference on individual particle\ntrajectories. Using the simulation of Paper I, we compute the root-mean-square\nrelative velocity, <w^2>^1/2, as a function of the friction times, tau_p1 and\ntau_p2, of the two particles, and show that the PP10 prediction is in\nsatisfactory agreement with the data, confirming its physical picture.

The golden standard typically is the behavior of learning dynamics in\npotential games, where many evolutionary dynamics, e.g., replicator, are known\nto converge to sets of equilibria.

We examine issues such as:\n  Point-wise convergence: Does the system actually equilibrate even in the\npresence of continuums of equilibria?\n  Computing regions of attraction: Given point-wise convergence can we compute\nthe region of asymptotic stability of each equilibrium (e.g., estimate its\nvolume, geometry)?\n  System invariants: Invariant functions remain constant along every system\ntrajectory. This notion is orthogonal to the game theoretic concept of a\npotential function, which always strictly increases/decreases along system\ntrajectories.

We illustrate our considerations by examining the time\nevolution of entanglement of single and double excitation NOON and EPR states.\nA comparison is made when each cavity is coupled to own reservoir or both\ncavities are coupled to a common reservoir. It is shown that the evolution of\nthe initial entanglement and transfer of entanglement from the squeezed\nreservoir to the cavity modes depend crucially on the matching of the initial\ncorrelations to that contained in the squeezed reservoir. In particular, it is\nfound that initially entangled modes with correlations different from the\nreservoir correlations prevent the transfer of the correlations from the\nsqueezed field to the modes. In addition, we find that the transient\nentanglement exhibits several features unique to quantum nature of squeezing.\nIn particular, we show that in the case of separate squeezed reservoirs a\nvariation of the decay time of the initial entanglement with the squeezing\nphase is unique to quantum squeezing. In the case of a common reservoir a\nrecurrence of entanglement occurs and we find that this feature also results\nfrom the reservoir correlations unique to quantum squeezing.

By adding new\nYukawa couplings between the messenger fields and Higgs fields, we find that\nthis mechanism can predict a neutralino dark matter with correct relic density\nand a Higgs boson with mass around 125 GeV. All our survived points have some\ncommon features. Firstly, the Higgs sector falls into the decoupling limit. So\nthe properties of the light Higgs boson are similar to the predictions of the\nStandard Model one. Secondly, the correct EWSB hints a relatively small\n$\\mu$-term, which makes the lightest neutralino lighter than the lightest stau.\nSo a bino-higgsino dark matter with correct relic density can be achieved.

A perfect sample is assumed to mirror every property of the whole\npopulation. Unfortunately, such a perfect sample is hard to collect in complex\npopulations such as graphs (e.g. web graphs, social networks etc), where an\nunderlying network connects the units of the population. Therefore, a good\nsample will be representative in the sense that graph properties of interest\ncan be estimated with a known degree of accuracy. While previous work focused\nparticularly on sampling schemes used to estimate certain graph properties\n(e.g. triangle count), much less is known for the case when we need to estimate\nvarious graph properties with the same sampling scheme. In this paper, we\npropose a generic stream sampling framework for big-graph analytics, called\nGraph Sample and Hold (gSH). To begin, the proposed framework samples from\nmassive graphs sequentially in a single pass, one edge at a time, while\nmaintaining a small state. We then show how to produce unbiased estimators for\nvarious graph properties from the sample. Given that the graph analysis\nalgorithms will run on a sample instead of the whole population, the runtime\ncomplexity of these algorithm is kept under control. Moreover, given that the\nestimators of graph properties are unbiased, the approximation error is kept\nunder control. Finally, we show the performance of the proposed framework (gSH)\non various types of graphs, such as social graphs, among others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Mar 2014 12:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-18"}

The objective of the work is to generalize this model to the\nconditions of the deep layer of a clayey vadose zone with the overburden\npressure, multiple shrinkage-swelling, and variation of water content in a\nsmall range. We aim to show that the scanning shrinkage and swelling curves,\nand steady shrink-swell cycles existing in such conditions, inevitably lead to\nthe occurrence of cracks and a hysteretic crack volume.

Such functions may be obtained by the residues of certain\nEisenstein series on covers of groups, \"theta functions,\" but the Fourier\ncoefficients of these residues are not well-understood, even for low degree\ncovers of $GL_2$. Patterson and Chinta-Friedberg-Hoffstein proposed conjectured\nrelations for the Fourier coefficients of the $GL_2$ quartic and sextic theta\nfunctions (resp.), each obtained from a conjectured equality of non-Eulerian\nDirichlet series. In this article we propose a new framework for constructing\nspecific $L^2$ metaplectic functions and for understanding these conjectures:\ndescent integrals. We study descent integrals which begin with theta functions\non covers of larger rank classical groups and use them to construct certain\n$L^2$ metaplectic functions on covers related to $GL_2$. We then establish\ninformation about the Fourier coefficients of these metaplectic automorphic\nfunctions, properties which are consistent with the conjectures of Patterson\nand Chinta-Friedberg-Hoffstein. In particular, we prove that Fourier\ncoefficients of the descent functions are arithmetic for infinitely many primes\n$p$. We also show that they generate a representation with non-zero projection\nto the space of theta. We conjecture that the descents may be used to realize\nthe quartic and sextic theta functions. Moreover, this framework suggests that\neach of the conjectures of Patterson and Chinta-Friedberg-Hoffstein is the\nfirst in a series of relations between certain Fourier coefficients of two\nautomorphic forms on different covering groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Mar 2014 15:55:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 23:42:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2015 16:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-17"}

Network representation of such\nbehavioural interactions offers a powerful tool for structural as well as\ndynamical analysis of the underlying regulatory systems. In this paper, we\nfocus on the dominance interaction networks in the tropical social wasp\n\\textit{Ropalidia marginata} - a species where behavioural observations\nindicate that such interactions are principally responsible for the transfer of\ninformation between individuals about their colony needs, resulting in a\nregulation of their own activities. Our research reveals that the dominance\nnetworks of \\textit{R. marginata} are structurally similar to a class of\nnaturally evolved information processing networks, a fact confirmed also by the\npredominance of a specific substructure - the `feed-forward loop' - a key\nfunctional component in many other information transfer networks. The dynamical\nanalysis through Boolean modeling confirms that the networks are sufficiently\nstable under small fluctuations and yet capable of more efficient information\ntransfer compared to their randomized counterparts. Our results suggest the\ninvolvement of a common structural design principle in different biological\nregulatory systems and a possible similarity with respect to the effect of\nselection on the organization levels of such systems. The findings are also\nconsistent with the hypothesis that dominance behaviour has been shaped by\nnatural selection to co-opt the information transfer process in such social\ninsect species, in addition to its primal function of mediation of reproductive\ncompetition in the colony.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Mar 2014 09:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-19"}
