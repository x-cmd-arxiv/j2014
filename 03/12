It is an extensible digital construction that attains a discrepancy\nbelow 12/sqrt(N). The second construction rotates an integer lattice through an\nangle whose tangent is a quadratic irrational number. It attains a discrepancy\nof O(log(N)/N) which is the best possible rate. Previous work strongly\nindicated that such a discrepancy was possible, but no constructions were\navailable.

The methodology is based on\ndetail accounting for different contributions to the soil volume and water\ncontent during shrinkage. The key point is the calculation of the lacunar pore\nvolume variance at shrinkage. The reference shrinkage curve is determined by\neight physical soil parameters: (1) oven-dried specific volume; (2) maximum\nswelling water content; (3) mean solid density; (4) soil clay content; (5)\noven-dried structural porosity; (6) the ratio of aggregate solid mass to solid\nmass of intraaggregate matrix; (7) the lacunar factor that characterizes the\nrate of the lacunar pore volume change with water content; and (8) oven-dried\nlacunar pore volume.

Supersaturation is controlled\nin such a way that the overall aggregate volume grows linearly in time.\nClassical Ostwald ripening, which is recovered in the limit of vanishing\noverall growth, constitutes an unstable solution of the dynamics. In the\npresence of overall growth evaporation of aggregates always drives the dynamics\ninto a new, qualitatively different growth regime where ripening ceases, and\ngrowth proceeds at a constant number density of aggregates. We provide a\ncomprehensive description of the evolution of the aggregate size distribution\nin the constant density regime: the size distribution does not approach a\nuniversal shape, and even for moderate overall growth rates the standard\ndeviation of the aggregate radius decays monotonically. The implications of\nthis theory for the focusing of aggregate size distributions are discussed for\na range of different settings including the growth of tiny rain droplets in\nclouds, as long as they do not yet feel gravity, and the synthesis of\nnano-particles and quantum dots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 17:42:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-12"}

Despite the\ntrick being known for long time, to the best of our knowledge, the phenomenon\nstill lacks scientific explanation. Although it seems natural to think that\nshock-induced cavitation enhances the diffusion of CO$_2$ from the\nsupersaturated bulk liquid into the bubbles by breaking them up, the subtle\nmechanism by which this happens remains unknown. Here we show that the overall\nfoaming-over process can be divided into three stages where different physical\nphenomena take place in different time-scales, namely: bubble-collapse (or\ncavitation) stage, diffusion-driven stage and buoyancy-driven stage. In the\nbubble-collapse stage, the impact generates a train of expansion-compression\nwaves in the liquid that leads to the fragmentation of pre-existing gas\ncavities. Upon bubble fragmentation, the sudden increase of the\ninterface-area-to-volume ratio enhances mass transfer significantly, which\nmakes the bubble volume grow by a large factor until CO$_2$ is locally\ndepleted. At that point buoyancy takes over, making the bubble clouds rise and\neventually form buoyant vortex rings whose volume grows fast due to the\nfeedback between the buoyancy-induced rising speed and the advection-enhanced\nCO$_2$ transport from the bulk liquid to the bubble. The physics behind this\nexplosive process might also be connected to some geological phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 18:29:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 07:10:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 8 Nov 2014 15:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

We then derive the fluid\nand diffusion limits of the random walk as the network size goes to $\\infty$\nand deduce a number of properties of the push algorithm: 1) the number of newly\ninfected nodes in a push round, and the number of random selections needed so\nthat a given percent of the network is infected, are both asymptotically normal\n2) for large networks, starting with a nonzero proportion of infected nodes, a\npull round infects slightly more nodes on average 3) the number of rounds until\na given proportion $\\lambda$ of the network is infected converges to a constant\nfor almost all $\\lambda \\in (0,1)$.

Background\nand contamination uncertainties present in the data of non-focusing\nobservatories result in lower sensitivity to IC emission and a greater chance\nof false detection. We present 266ks NuSTAR observations of the Bullet cluster,\ndetected from 3-30 keV. NuSTAR's unprecedented hard X-ray focusing capability\nlargely eliminates confusion between diffuse IC and point sources; however, at\nthe highest energies the background still dominates and must be well\nunderstood. To this end, we have developed a complete background model\nconstructed of physically inspired components constrained by extragalactic\nsurvey field observations, the specific parameters of which are derived locally\nfrom data in non-source regions of target observations. Applying the background\nmodel to the Bullet cluster data, we find that the spectrum is well - but not\nperfectly - described as an isothermal plasma with kT=14.2+/-0.2 keV. To\nslightly improve the fit, a second temperature component is added, which\nappears to account for lower temperature emission from the cool core, pushing\nthe primary component to kT~15.3 keV. We see no convincing need to invoke an IC\ncomponent to describe the spectrum of the Bullet cluster, and instead argue\nthat it is dominated at all energies by emission from purely thermal gas. The\nconservatively derived 90% upper limit on the IC flux of 1.1e-12 erg/s/cm^2\n(50-100 keV), implying a lower limit on B>0.2{\\mu}G, is barely consistent with\ndetected fluxes previously reported.

The relative\neffect of mergers on spin magnitude is qualitatively different for minor and\nmajor mergers: mergers (and diffuse accretion) generally increase the magnitude\nof the angular momentum, but the most massive major mergers also give rise to a\npopulation of objects with less spin left. Without mergers secular accretion\nbuilds up the spin of galaxies but not that of haloes. It also (re)aligns\ngalaxies with their filament.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 20:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The neutrino luminosities of the stellar core\nof massive stars become larger as they get closer to the time of the core\ncollapse. As emitted neutrinos escape freely from the core, the core mass is\nsignificantly reduced when the neutrino luminosity is large. If a star is near\nthe Eddington luminosity when the neutrino luminosity is large, the star can\nexceed the Eddington luminosity because of the core neutrino mass loss. We\nsuggest that the stellar surface mass-loss rates due to the core neutrino\nemission can be higher than 1e-4 Msun/yr from ~ 1 year before the core\ncollapse. The mass-loss rates can exceed 1e-2 Msun/yr in ~ 10 days before the\ncore collapse. This mass-loss mechanism may be able to explain the enhanced\nmass loss observed in some supernova progenitors shortly before their\nexplosion. Even if the star is not close enough to the Eddington luminosity to\nenhance mass loss, the star can still expand because of the reduced\ngravitational force. This mechanism can be activated in Wolf-Rayet stars and it\ncan make hydrogen-poor, as well as hydrogen-rich, dense circumstellar media\nobserved in some supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 20:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-17"}

While each of these two types of dynamics has\nindividually been studied in the past, much less is known about the connection\nbetween the two. How does user information posting and seeking behavior\ninteract with the evolution of the underlying social network structure?\n  Here, we study ways in which network structure reacts to users posting and\nsharing content. We examine the complete dynamics of the Twitter information\nnetwork, where users post and reshare information while they also create and\ndestroy connections. We find that the dynamics of network structure can be\ncharacterized by steady rates of change, interrupted by sudden bursts.\nInformation diffusion in the form of cascades of post re-sharing often creates\nsuch sudden bursts of new connections, which significantly change users' local\nnetwork structure. These bursts transform users' networks of followers to\nbecome structurally more cohesive as well as more homogenous in terms of\nfollower interests. We also explore the effect of the information content on\nthe dynamics of the network and find evidence that the appearance of new topics\nand real-world events can lead to significant changes in edge creations and\ndeletions. Lastly, we develop a model that quantifies the dynamics of the\nnetwork and the occurrence of these bursts as a function of the information\nspreading through the network. The model can successfully predict which\ninformation diffusion events will lead to bursts in network dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 20:06:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-13"}

The goal\nis to have a publicly accessible experimentation platform for the verification\nof Scade programs.\n  The choice of SMT is determined by the fact that it offers more expressive\nlogics than propositional logic, yet their solvers have been shown to perform\nvery well. The expressiveness of SMT logics allows us to implement symbolic\nmodel checking thus avoiding the expansion of the complete state space of the\nmodels during the verification.\n  In order to reduce the complexity we transform the Scade programs into SMT\ninstances in two steps. First they are reduced to programs of a synchronous\ndata flow language Lama. This language has simpler semantics than Scade while\nstill preserving some of the programmer's abstractions. Next we interpret such\na Lama program as a system of quantifier free first-order formulas.\n  The remaining abstractions in Lama can be used to simplify these systems.\nThis in turn could lead to speeding up the verification process and allowing\nmore properties to be verifiable.\n  We implemented these transformations successfully in a software using\nHaskell.

Because it is data-oblivious and deterministic, Zig-zag Sort can be\nimplemented as a simple O(n log n)-size sorting network, thereby providing a\nsolution to an open problem posed by Incerpi and Sedgewick in 1985. In\naddition, Zig-zag Sort is a variant of Shellsort, and is, in fact, the first\ndeterministic Shellsort variant running in O(n log n) time. The existence of\nsuch an algorithm was posed as an open problem by Plaxton et al. in 1992 and\nalso by Sedgewick in 1996. More relevant for today, however, is the fact that\nthe existence of a simple data-oblivious deterministic sorting algorithm\nrunning in O(n log n) time simplifies the inner-loop computation in several\nproposed oblivious-RAM simulation methods (which utilize AKS sorting networks),\nand this, in turn, implies simplified mechanisms for privacy-preserving data\noutsourcing in several cloud computing applications. We provide both\nconstructive and non-constructive implementations of Zig-zag Sort, based on the\nexistence of a circuit known as an epsilon-halver, such that the constant\nfactors in our constructive implementations are orders of magnitude smaller\nthan those for constructive variants of the AKS sorting network, which are also\nbased on the use of epsilon-halvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 23:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-19"}

Core teams form by a\nPoisson process and produce a Poisson distribution of team sizes in which\nlarger teams are exceedingly rare. The second mode employs extended teams,\nwhich started as core teams, but subsequently accumulated new members\nproportional to the past productivity of their members. Given time, this mode\ngives rise to a power-law tail of large teams (10-1000 members), which features\nin many fields today. Based on this model we construct an analytical functional\nform that allows the contribution of different modes of authorship to be\ndetermined directly from the data and is applicable to any field. The model\nalso offers a solid foundation for studying other social aspects of science,\nsuch as productivity and collaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 01:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-13"}

This argument is refuted in two basic\nways: (i) it is noted that the Maudlin experiment cannot be meaningfully recast\nwith absorbers described by quantum states; instead the author replaces it with\nan ordinary which-way experiment; and (ii) the extant rebuttals to the Maudlin\nchallenge in its original form are not in fact subject to the alleged flaws\nthat Lewis ascribes to them.

As an example, the semiconductor technologies\nare used to highlight the complexities especially with respect to energy and\nwater consumption. The need for specific representations and metric to\nseparately assess products and technologies is discussed. It is highlighted\nthat applying product-oriented approaches would result in abandoning or\ndisfavoring of new technologies that could otherwise help toward a better\nworld. Second, several believed-untouchable hot spots are highlighted to\nemphasize on their importance and footprint. The list includes, but not limited\nto, i) User Computer-Interfaces (UCIs), especially screens and displays, ii)\nNetwork-Computer Interlaces (NCIs), such as electronic and optical ports, and\niii) electricity power interfaces. In addition, considering cross-regional\nsocial and economic impacts, and also taking into account the marketing nature\nof the need for many ICT's product and services in both forms of hardware and\nsoftware, the complexity of End of Life (EoL) stage of ICT products,\ntechnologies, and services is explored. Finally, the impact of smart management\nand intelligence, and in general software, in ICT solutions and products is\nhighlighted. In particular, it is observed that, even using the same\ntechnology, the significance of software could be highly variable depending on\nthe level of intelligence and awareness deployed. With examples from an\ninterconnected network of data centers managed using Dynamic Voltage and\nFrequency Scaling (DVFS) technology and smart cooling systems, it is shown that\nthe unadjusted assessments could be highly uncertain, and even inconsistent, in\ncalculating the management component's significance on the ICT impacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 03:05:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 20:23:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 31 May 2014 03:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-03"}

To\nconcurrently process large-scale data, MapReduce with an open source\nimplementation named Hadoop is proposed. In practical Hadoop systems one kind\nof issue that vitally impacts the overall performance is know as the\nNP-complete minimum make span problem. One main solution is to assign tasks on\ndata local nodes to avoid link occupation since network bandwidth is a scarce\nresource. Many methodologies for enhancing data locality are proposed such as\nthe HDS and state-of-the-art scheduler BAR. However, all of them either ignore\nallocating tasks in a global view or disregard available bandwidth as the basis\nfor scheduling. In this paper we propose a heuristic bandwidth-aware task\nscheduler BASS to combine Hadoop with SDN. It is not only able to guarantee\ndata locality in a global view but also can efficiently assign tasks in an\noptimized way. Both examples and experiments demonstrate that BASS has the best\nperformance in terms of job completion time.

The present planetary ephemerides (DE,\nINPOP, EPM) are mainly based on such observations. However, the data used by\nthe planetary ephemerides are not the direct raw tracking data, but\nmeasurements deduced after the analysis of raw data made by the space agencies\nand the access to such processed measurements remains difficult in terms of\navailability.\n  The first part of the study deals with the analysis of the Mars Global\nSurveyor (MGS) tracking data. The tracking observations containing one-, two-,\nand three-way Doppler and two-way range are then used to reconstruct MGS orbit\nprecisely. As a supplementary exploitation of MGS, we derived the solar corona\nmodel and estimated the average electron density along the line of sight\nseparately for slow and fast wind regions. Fitting the planetary ephemerides,\nincluding additional data which were corrected for the solar corona\nperturbations, noticeably improves the extrapolation capability of the\nplanetary ephemerides and the estimation of the asteroid masses (Verma et al.,\n2013).

We designed two in silico experiments that compared\nexisting and virtual sunflower cultivars (Helianthus annuus L.) in a target\npopulation of cropping environments by simulating a range of indicators of crop\nperformance. Optimization methods were then used to search for GEM combinations\nthat matched desired crop specifications. Computational experiments showed that\nthe fit of particular cultivars in specific environments is gradually\nincreasing with the knowledge of pedo-climatic conditions. At the regional\nscale, tuning the choice of cultivar impacted crop performance the same\nmagnitude as the effect of yearly genetic progress made by breeding. When\nconsidering virtual genetic material, designed by recombining plant traits,\ncultivar choice had a greater positive impact on crop performance and\nstability. Results suggested that breeding for key traits conferring plant\nplasticity improved cultivar global adaptation capacity whereas increasing\ngenetic diversity allowed to choose cultivars with distinctive traits that were\nmore adapted to specific conditions. Consequently, breeding genetic material\nthat is both plastic and diverse may improve yield stability of agricultural\nsystems exposed to climatic variability. We argue that process-based modeling\ncould help enhancing spatial management of cultivated genetic diversity and\ncould be integrated in functional breeding approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 06:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-13"}

Indeed, it\nencounters strong constraints in terms of numerics in the small Stokes number\nlimit, which can lead to a degeneracy of the accuracy of standard numerical\nmethods. These constraints are: 1/as the resulting sound speed is inversely\nproportional to the Stokes number, it is highly CFL-constraining, and 2/the\nsystem tends to an advection-diffusion limit equation on the number density\nthat has to be properly approximated by the designed scheme used for the whole\nrange of Stokes numbers.

However, the intrinsic multimode spectral-temporal\nstructure of pulsed PDC often poses a severe hindrance for the direct\nimplementation of the heralding of pure single-photon states or, for example,\ncontinuous-variable entanglement distillation experiments. To get rid of\nmultimode effects narrowband frequency filtering is frequently applied to\nachieve a single-mode behavior.\n  A rigorous theoretical description to accurately describe the effects of\nfiltering on PDC, however, is still missing. To date, the theoretical models of\nfiltered PDC are rooted in the discrete-variable domain and only account for\nfiltering in the low gain regime, where only a few photon pairs are emitted at\nany single point in time. In this paper we extend these theoretical\ndescriptions and put forward a simple model, which is able to accurately\ndescribe the effects of filtering on PDC in the continuous-variable domain.\n  This developed straightforward theoretical framework enables us to accurately\nquantify the trade-off between suppression of higher-order modes, reduced\npurity and lowered Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement, when narrowband\nfilters are applied to multimode type-II PDC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 11:12:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Aug 2014 17:56:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-19"}

Characterizing the\ncomposition and thermal and dynamical structure of the outflow provides\nconstraints that are essential for understanding AGB evolution, including the\nrate of mass loss and isotopic ratios.\n  We modeled the CO emission from the wind of the low mass-loss rate\noxygen-rich AGB star W Hya using data obtained by the HIFI, PACS, and SPIRE\ninstruments onboard the Herschel Space Observatory and ground-based telescopes.\n$^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO lines are used to constrain the intrinsic\n$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio from resolved HIFI lines.\n  The acceleration of the outflow up to about 5.5 km/s is quite slow and can be\nrepresented by a beta-type velocity law with index 5. Beyond this point,\nacceleration up the terminal velocity of 7 km/s is faster. Using the J=10-9,\n9-8, and 6-5 transitions, we find an intrinsic $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of\n$18\\pm10$ for W Hya, where the error bar is mostly due to uncertainties in the\n$^{12}$CO abundance and the stellar flux around 4.6 $\\mu$m. To match the\nlow-excitation CO lines, these molecules need to be photo-dissociated at about\n500 stellar radii. The radial dust emission intensity profile measured by PACS\nimages at 70 $\\mu$m shows substantially stronger emission than our model\npredicts beyond 20 arcsec.\n  The initial slow acceleration of the wind implies inefficient wind driving in\nthe lower part of the envelope.

The reason behind this limitation is the high\nbandwidth needed by the sensor, which becomes also an issue for the distributed\nsystem TCP/IP communications. Since traffic volume is too high, 3D data has to\nbe compressed before it can be sent over the network. The solution consists in\nselfcoding the Kinect data into RGB images and then using a standard multimedia\ncodec to compress color maps. Information from different sources is collected\ninto a central client computer, where point clouds are transformed to\nreconstruct the scene in 3D.

BLE is described as a new\nprotocol in the official Bluetooth 4.0 specification. To design\nenergy-efficient devices, the protocol provides a number of parameters that\nneed to be optimized within an energy, latency and throughput design space. To\nminimize power consumption, the protocol parameters have to be optimized for a\ngiven application. Therefore, an energy-model that can predict the energy\nconsumption of a BLE-based wireless device for different parameter value\nsettings, is needed. As BLE differs from the original Bluetooth significantly,\nmodels for Bluetooth cannot be easily applied to the BLE protocol. Since the\nlast one year, there have been a couple of proposals on energy models for BLE.\nHowever, none of them can model all the operating modes of the protocol. This\npaper presents a precise energy model of the BLE protocol, that allows the\ncomputation of a device's power consumption in all possible operating modes. To\nthe best of our knowledge, our proposed model is not only one of the most\naccurate ones known so far (because it accounts for all protocol parameters),\nbut it is also the only one that models all the operating modes of BLE.\nFurthermore, we present a sensitivity analysis of the different parameters on\nthe energy consumption and evaluate the accuracy of the model using both\ndiscrete event simulation and actual measurements. Based on this model,\nguidelines for system designers are presented, that help choosing the right\nparameters for optimizing the energy consumption for a given application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 13:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-13"}

We demonstrate this model's ability to\nefficiently and accurately find community structure in synthetic bipartite\nnetworks with known structure and in real-world bipartite networks with unknown\nstructure, and we characterize its performance in practical contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 13:54:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 21:38:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-14"}

A polynomial- time algorithm is designed for partial price\ndifferentiation scheme that can compute the optimal partial differentiation\nprices. The willingness of the users to pay is also considered while designing\nprice differentiation schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 15:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-13"}

A maximum likelihood fit is performed\nto find the best-fit shower parameters. A related reconstruction algorithm has\nalready been shown to provide significant improvements over traditional\nreconstruction for both the CAT and H.E.S.S. experiments. We demonstrate a\nsignificant improvement to the template generation step of the procedure, by\nthe use of a full Monte Carlo air shower simulation in combination with a\nray-tracing optics simulation to more accurately model the expected camera\nimages. This reconstruction step is combined with an MVA-based background\nrejection.\n  Examples are shown of the performance of the ImPACT analysis on both\nsimulated and measured (from a strong VHE source) gamma-ray data from the\nH.E.S.S. array, demonstrating an improvement in sensitivity of more than a\nfactor two in observation time over traditional image moments-fitting methods,\nwith comparable performance to previous likelihood fitting analyses.
