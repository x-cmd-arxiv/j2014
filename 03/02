The prediction of the\nabsolute flux and energy spectrum of the emitted reactor neutrinos hinges upon\na series of seminal papers based on measurements performed in the 1970s and\n1980s. The steadily improving reactor neutrino measurement techniques and\nrecent re-considerations of the agreement between the predicted and observed\nreactor neutrino flux motivates revisiting the underlying beta spectra\nmeasurements. A method is proposed to use an accelerator proton beam delivered\nto an engineered target to yield a neutron field tailored to reproduce the\nneutron energy spectrum present in the core of an operating nuclear reactor.\nFoils of the primary reactor fissionable isotopes placed in this tailored\nneutron flux will ultimately emit beta particles from the resultant fission\nproducts. Measurement of these beta particles in a time projection chamber with\na perpendicular magnetic field provides a distinctive set of systematic\nconsiderations for comparison to the original seminal beta spectra\nmeasurements. Ancillary measurements such as gamma-ray emission and\npost-irradiation radiochemical analysis will further constrain the absolute\nnormalization of beta emissions per fission.

We have applied the model to the atmospheres of the hot Jupiters HD\n209458b and HD 189733b.

We find that the distribution of molecules with altitude and\nlongitude in the atmospheres of these two hot Jupiters is complex because of\nthe interplay of the various physical and chemical processes at work. Much of\nthe distribution of molecules is driven by the strong zonal wind and the\nlimited extent of vertical transport, resulting in an important homogenisation\nof the chemical composition with longitude. In general, molecular abundances\nare quenched horizontally to values typical of the hottest dayside regions, and\nthus the composition in the cooler nightside regions is highly contaminated by\nthat of warmer dayside regions. As a consequence, the abundance of methane\nremains low, even below the predictions of previous one-dimensional models,\nwhich is likely to be in conflict with the high CH4 content inferred from\nobservations of the dayside of HD 209458b. Another consequence of the important\nlongitudinal homogenisation of the abundances is that the variability of the\nchemical composition has little effect on the way the emission spectrum is\nmodified with phase and on the changes in the transmission spectrum from the\ntransit ingress to the egress, these variations in the spectra being mainly due\nto changes in the temperature rather than in the composition between the\ndifferent sides of the planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Mar 2014 19:28:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 11:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

This phase has the remarkable property of being more rigid than any\nknown material. It can therefore sustain large shear stresses, supporting\ntorsional oscillations of large amplitude. The torsional oscillations could\nlead to observable electromagnetic signals if strange stars have a crystalline\ncolor superconducting crust. Indeed, considering a simple model of strange star\nwith a bare quark matter surface, it turns out that a positive charge is\nlocalized in a narrow shell about ten Fermi thick beneath the star surface. The\nelectrons needed to neutralize the positive charge of quarks spill in the star\nexterior forming an electromagnetically bounded atmosphere hundreds of Fermi\nthick. When a torsional oscillation is excited, for example by a stellar\nglitch, the positive charge oscillates with typical kHz frequencies, for a\ncrust thickness of about one-tenth of the stellar radius, to hundreds of Hz,\nfor a crust thickness of about nine-tenths of the stellar radius. Higher\nfrequencies, of the order of few GHz, can be reached if the star crust is of\nthe order of few centimeters thick.

The novelty of the paper is that we reformulate the\ngoverning equations into a nonlinear hyperbolic conservation law plus source\nterms. A second-order fractional-step algorithm is used to solve the\nreformulated equations. In the first step of the fractional-step algorithm, we\nsolve the homogeneous hyperbolic shallow-water equations by the\nwave-propagation finite volume method. The resulting intermediate solution is\nthen used as the initial condition for the initial-boundary value problem in\nthe second step.

In the philosophy of science and physics\ncommunities the orthodox position states that the physical world is\nindeterministic: quantum events would have no causes but happen by irreducible\nchance. Arguably the clearest theorem that leads to this conclusion is Bell's\ntheorem. The commonly accepted 'solution' to the theorem is 'indeterminism', in\nagreement with the Copenhagen interpretation. Here it is recalled that\nindeterminism is not really a physical but rather a philosophical hypothesis,\nand that it has counterintuitive and far-reaching implications. At the same\ntime another solution to Bell's theorem exists, often termed 'superdeterminism'\nor 'total determinism'. Superdeterminism appears to be a philosophical position\nthat is centuries and probably millennia old: it is for instance Spinoza's\ndeterminism. If Bell's theorem has both indeterministic and deterministic\nsolutions, choosing between determinism and indeterminism is a philosophical\nquestion, not a matter of physical experimentation, as is widely believed. If\nit is impossible to use physics for deciding between both positions, it is\nlegitimate to ask which philosophical theories are of help. Here it is argued\nthat probability theory - more precisely the interpretation of probability - is\ninstrumental for advancing the debate. It appears that the hypothesis of\ndeterminism allows to answer a series of precise questions from probability\ntheory, while indeterminism remains silent for these questions. From this point\nof view determinism appears to be the most reasonable assumption, after all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Mar 2014 01:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-04"}

We\nexplain the paradoxical radiative transfer of the H$_2$O ($1_{10}-1_{01}$)\nline. Despite discouragingly high optical depth caused by the large Einstein A\ncoefficient, the subcritical excitation in the cold, rarefied H$_2$ causes the\nline brightness to scale linearly with column density. Thus the water line can\nprovide information on the chemical and dynamical processes in the darkest\nregion in the center of a cold, dense cloud. The inverse P-Cygni profile of the\nobserved water line generally indicates a contracting cloud. This profile is\nreproduced with a dynamical model of slow contraction from unstable\nquasi-static hydrodynamic equilibrium (an unstable Bonnor-Ebert sphere).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Mar 2014 03:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

For this purpose, designing a linear network\nerror correction MDS code based on the existing results for each information\nrate is an efficient solution. In order to solve the problem more efficiently,\nwe present the concept of variable-rate linear network error correction MDS\ncodes, that is, these linear network error correction MDS codes of different\nrates have the same local encoding kernel at each internal node.

In our biological model, three morphological\nstages were defined: (a) mammary gland tissue from pregnant mice, (b)\npreneoplastic nodules, and (c) neoplastic tissue. It was found that neoplastic\ntissues could be distinguished from normal and prenoeplastic tissue. Spin-spin\nand spin-lattice relaxation times and the diffusion coefficient of water\nprotons are increased in the neoplastic tissue relative to mammary gland tissue\nfrom pregnant mice and preneoplastic nodule tissue. These results suggested\nthat one can use a pulsed NMR method to detect and even predict breast cancer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Mar 2014 04:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}
