To identify and model\nthe physical processes responsible for the generation of magnetic fields in\nmassive stars, it is important to establish whether magnetic massive stars are\nfound in very young star-forming regions or whether they are formed in close\ninteracting binary systems.\n  In the framework of our ESO Large Program, we carried out low-resolution\nspectropolarimetric observations with FORS2 in 2013 April of the three most\nmassive central stars in the Trifid nebula, HD164492A, HD164492C, and\nHD164492D. These observations indicated a strong longitudinal magnetic field of\nabout 500-600G in the poorly studied component HD164492C. To confirm this\ndetection, we used HARPS in spectropolarimetric mode on two consecutive nights\nin 2013 June.\n  Our HARPS observations confirmed the longitudinal magnetic field in\nHD164492C.

Long-term monitoring using\nhigh-resolution spectropolarimetry is necessary to separate the contribution of\neach component to the magnetic signal. Given the location of the system\nHD164492C in one of the youngest star formation regions, this system can be\nconsidered as a Rosetta Stone for our understanding of the origin of magnetic\nfields in massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2014 17:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

Approaches which\ncan proactively detect computing core failures and take action to relocate the\ncomputing core's job onto reliable cores can make a significant step towards\nautomating fault tolerance.\n  Method: This paper describes an experimental investigation into the use of\nmulti-agent approaches for fault tolerance.

The approaches are\ninvestigated for single core failure scenarios that can occur in the execution\nof parallel reduction algorithms on computer clusters.

Udpda are a simple computation model that\naccept exactly the unary regular languages, but can be exponentially more\nsuccinct than finite-state automata. We complete the complexity landscape for\nudpda by showing that emptiness (and thus universality) is P-hard, equivalence\nand compressed membership problems are P-complete, and inclusion is\ncoNP-complete. Our upper bounds are based on a translation theorem between\nudpda and straight-line programs over the binary alphabet (SLPs). We show that\nthe characteristic sequence of any udpda can be represented as a pair of\nSLPs---one for the prefix, one for the lasso---that have size linear in the\nsize of the udpda and can be computed in polynomial time. Hence, decision\nproblems on udpda are reduced to decision problems on SLPs. Conversely, any SLP\ncan be converted in logarithmic space into a udpda, and this forms the basis\nfor our lower bound proofs. We show coNP-hardness of the ordered matching\nproblem for SLPs, from which we derive coNP-hardness for inclusion. In\naddition, we complete the complexity landscape for unary nondeterministic\npushdown automata by showing that the universality problem is $\\Pi_2 \\mathrm\nP$-hard, using a new class of integer expressions.

An image results from a sequence of projections\nof the convolution of the density function with the unknown microscopy\ncorrection function that we also learn from the data. We invoke a novel design\nof experiment, involving imaging at multiple values of the parameter that\ncontrols the sub-surface depth from which information about the density\nstructure is carried, to result in the image. Real-life material density\nfunctions are characterised by high density contrasts and typically are highly\ndiscontinuous, implying that they exhibit correlation structures that do not\nvary smoothly. In the absence of training data, modelling such correlation\nstructures of real material density functions is not possible. So we discretise\nthe material sample and treat values of the density function at chosen\nlocations inside it as independent and distribution-free parameters. Resolution\nof the available image dictates the discretisation length of the model; three\nmodels pertaining to distinct resolution classes are developed.

Our\nfocus is on the applicability of these approaches to isolated quantum systems\nsuch as ultra-cold atoms in engineered optical potentials. For two lattices\nconnected by a junction, we find that the current and particle number\nfluctuations from the microcanonical approach compare well with the values\npredicted by the Landauer formalism and FCS assuming a binomial distribution.\nHowever, we demonstrate that well-defined reservoirs (i.e., particles in\nFermi-Dirac distributions) are not present for a substantial duration of the\nquasi-steady state. Thus, the Landauer assumption of reservoirs and/or\ninelastic effects is not necessary for establishing a quasi-steady state.\nMaintaining such a state indefinitely requires an infinite system, and in this\nlimit well-defined Fermi-Dirac distributions can occur. A Kubo approach -- in\nthe spirit of the microcanonical picture -- bridges the gap between the two\nformalisms, giving explicit analytical expressions for the formation of the\nsteady state.

For accurate\ncoefficients and therefore forecasts, tides at the buoys must be accounted for.\nIn this study, five methods for coefficient estimation are compared, each of\nwhich accounts for tides differently. The first three subtract off a tidal\nprediction based on (1) a localized harmonic analysis involving 29 days of data\nimmediately preceding the tsunami event, (2) 68 pre-existing harmonic\nconstituents specific to each buoy, and (3) an empirical orthogonal function\nfit to the previous 25 hrs of data. Method (4) is a Kalman smoother that uses\nmethod (1) as its input. These four methods estimate source coefficients after\ndetiding. Method (5) estimates the coefficients simultaneously with a\ntwo-component harmonic model that accounts for the tides. The five methods are\nevaluated using archived data from eleven DART buoys, to which selected\nartificial tsunami signals are superimposed. These buoys represent a full range\nof observed tidal conditions and background BP noise in the Pacific and\nAtlantic, and the artificial signals have a variety of patterns and induce\nvarying signal-to-noise ratios. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of least\nsquares estimates of sources coefficients using varying amounts of data are\nused to compare the five detiding methods. The RMSE varies over two orders of\nmagnitude between detiding methods, generally decreasing in the order listed,\nwith method (5) yielding the most accurate estimate of source coefficient.

To understand technology$\\text{'}$s influence on\nEnglish communication, four different corpora were analyzed and compared:\nWriting from Books using the 1-grams database from the Google Books project,\nTwitter, IRC Chat, and transcribed Talking. Multi-word confusion matrices\nrevealed that Talking has the most similarity when compared to the other modes\nof communication, while 1-grams were the least similar form of communication\nanalyzed. Based on the analysis of word usage, word usage frequency\ndistributions, and word class usage, among other things, Talking is also the\nmost similar to Twitter and IRC Chat. This suggests that communicating using\nTwitter and IRC Chat evolved from Talking rather than Writing. When we\ncommunicate online, even though we are writing, we do not Tweet or Chat how we\nwrite books; we Tweet and Chat how we Speak.

Turbulence is amenable to analysis with linear theory if\nit is subject to rapid distortions, i.e., motions occurring on a time scale\nthat is short compared to the time scale for non-linear interactions. Such an\napproach could prove useful for understanding aspects of astrophysical\nturbulence, which is often subject to rapid distortions, such as supernova\nexplosions or the free-fall associated with gravitational instability. As a\nproof of principle, a particularly simple problem is considered here: the\nevolution of vorticity due to a planar rarefaction in an ideal gas. Vorticity\ncan either grow or decay in the wake of a rarefaction front, and there are two\ncompeting effects that determine which outcome occurs: entropy fluctuations\ncouple to the mean pressure gradient to produce vorticity via baroclinic\neffects, whereas vorticity is damped due to the conservation of angular\nmomentum as the fluid expands. In the limit of purely entropic fluctuations in\nthe ambient fluid, a strong rarefaction generates vorticity with a turbulent\nMach number on the order of the root-mean square of the ambient entropy\nfluctuations. The analytical results are shown to compare well with results\nfrom two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations. Analytical solutions are\nalso derived in the linear regime of Reynolds-averaged turbulence models. This\nhighlights an inconsistency in standard turbulence models that prevents them\nfrom accurately capturing the physics of rarefaction-turbulence interaction.\nFinally, dimensional analysis of the equations indicates that rapid distortion\nof turbulence can give rise to two distinct regimes in the turbulent spectrum:\na distortion range at large scales where linear distortion effects dominate,\nand an inertial range at small scales where non-linear effects dominate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2014 20:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We introduce a two-zone model consisting of an acceleration zone (the\nshocks) and a radiation zone (the plasma downstream the shocks). The\nacceleration in the shocks, which is an unavoidable consequence of the\nefficient proton acceleration, requires efficient transport from the radiation\nback to the acceleration zone. On the other hand, stochastic acceleration in\nthe radiation zone can enhance the secondary spectra of muons and kaons\nsignificantly if there is a sufficiently large turbulent region. Overall, it is\nplausible that neutrino spectra can be enhanced by up to a factor of two at the\npeak by stochastic acceleration, that an additional spectral peaks appears from\nshock acceleration of the secondary muons and pions, and that the neutrino\nproduction from kaon decays is enhanced.

A special\nfeature of spin liquids is that symmetries can be fractionalized, and different\npatterns of symmetry fractionalization imply distinct phases. The symmetry\nfractionalization pattern for the kagome spin liquid remains to be determined.\nA popular approach to studying spin liquids is to decompose the physical spin\ninto partons obeying either bose (Schwinger bosons) or fermi (Abrikosov\nfermions) statstics, which are then treated within the mean-field theory. A\nlongstanding question has been whether these two approaches are truly distinct,\nor describe the same phase in complementary ways. Here we show that all 8 $Z_2$\nspin liquid phases in Schwinger-boson mean-field (SBMF) construction can also\nbe described in terms of Abrikosov fermions, unifying pairs of theories that\nseem rather distinct. The key idea is that for $Z_2$ spin liquid states that\nadmit a SBMF description on kagome lattice, the symmetry fractionalization of\nvisions is uniquely fixed. Two promising candidate states for kagome Heisenberg\nmodel, Sachdev's $Q_{1}=Q_{2}$ SBMF state and Lu-Ran-Lee's $Z_2[0,\\pi]\\beta$\nAbrikosov fermion state, are found to describe the same symmetric spin liquid\nphase.

A critical goal of this modeling is\ndisentangling vignetted and unvignetted backgrounds through their different\nspatial distributions. Employing either maximum likelihood or Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo, we can derive probability distribution functions for the source\nand background parameters together, or we can fit and subtract the background,\nleaving the description of the source non-parametric. We calibrate and\ndemonstrate this method against a variety of simulated images, and then apply\nit to Chandra observations of the hot gaseous halo around the elliptical galaxy\nNGC 720. We are able to follow the X-ray emission below a tenth of the\nbackground, and to infer a hot gas mass within 35 kpc of 4-5x10^9 Msun, with\nsome indication that the profile continues to at least 50 kpc and that it\nsteepens as the radius increases. We derive much stronger constraints on the\nsurface brightness profile than previous studies, which employed the spectral\nmethod, and we show that the density profiles inferred from these studies are\nin conflict with the observed surface brightness profile.

The large magnitude gap is a\nconsequence of the extreme merger ratio within fossil systems and therefore it\nis an evolutionary effect.

The graphlet kernel of Shervashidze et\nal. [32] uses induced sub-graphs of k nodes (christened as graphlets by Przulj\n[28]) as motifs in the vector representation, and computes the kernel via a dot\nproduct between these vectors. One can easily show that this is a valid kernel\nbetween graphs. However, such a vector representation suffers from a few\ndrawbacks.

In this paper we present analysis of candidate\nmassive young stellar objects (YSOs), i.e., {\\it in situ, current} massive star\nformation (MSF) in the Bridge using {\\it Spitzer} mid-IR and complementary\noptical and near-IR photometry. While we definitely find YSOs in the Bridge,\nthe most massive are $\\sim10 M_\\odot$, $\\ll45 M_\\odot$ found in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC). The intensity of MSF in the Bridge also appears\ndecreasing, as the most massive YSOs are less massive than those formed in the\npast. To investigate environmental effects on MSF, we have compared properties\nof massive YSOs in the Bridge to those in the LMC. First, YSOs in the Bridge\nare apparently less embedded than in the LMC: 81% of Bridge YSOs show optical\ncounterparts, compared to only 56% of LMC sources with the same range of mass,\ncircumstellar dust mass, and line-of-sight extinction. Circumstellar envelopes\nare evidently more porous or clumpy in the Bridge's low-metallicity\nenvironment. Second, we have used whole samples of YSOs in the LMC and the\nBridge to estimate the probability of finding YSOs at a given \\hi\\ column\ndensity, N(HI). We found that the LMC has $\\sim3\\times$ higher probability than\nthe Bridge for N(HI) $>10\\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, but the trend reverses at\nlower N(HI). Investigating whether this lower efficiency relative to HI is due\nto less efficient molecular cloud formation, or less efficient cloud collapse,\nor both, will require sensitive molecular gas observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2014 22:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

However,\nthere is a need for tools to map new data onto existing transportation\ninfrastructure. In this work, we propose a system that leverages this data to\nidentify patterns in road usage. First, we develop an algorithm to mine\nbillions of calls and learn location transition probabilities of callers. These\ntransition probabilities are then upscaled with demographic data to estimate\norigin-destination (OD) flows of residents between any two intersections of a\ncity. Next, we implement a distributed incremental traffic assignment algorithm\nto route these flows on road networks and estimate congestion and level of\nservice for each roadway. From this assignment, we construct a bipartite usage\nnetwork by connecting census tracts to the roads used by their inhabitants.\nComparing the topologies of the physical road network and bipartite usage\nnetwork allows us to classify each road's role in a city's transportation\nnetwork and detect causes of local bottlenecks. Finally, we demonstrate an\ninteractive, web-based visualization platform that allows researchers,\npolicymakers, and drivers to explore road congestion and usage in a new\ndimension. To demonstrate the flexibility of this system, we perform these\nanalyses in multiple cities across the globe with diverse geographical and\nsociodemographic qualities. This platform provides a foundation to build\ncongestion mitigation solutions and generate new insights into urban mobility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2014 23:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

Building upon recent successes in mathematical\nmodeling of the human glucose-insulin system, we show that both food intake and\ninsulin therapy likely demand increasingly precise control over insulin\nsensitivity if oscillations at a healthy average glucose concentration are to\nbe maintained.

The inner boundary of the\nsimulation domain is carefully chosen so that the fiducial Bondi radius is\nresolved and the accretion rate of the black hole is determined\nself-consistently. In analogy to previous works, we assume that the specific\nangular momentum of the galaxy is low. It is well-known that when the accretion\nrates are high and low, the central AGNs will be in cold and hot accretion\nmodes, which correspond to the radiative and kinetic feedback modes,\nrespectively. The emitted spectrum from the hot accretion flows is harder than\nthat from the cold accretion flows, which could result in a higher Compton\ntemperature accompanied by a more efficient radiative heating, according to\nprevious theoretical works. Such a difference of the Compton temperature\nbetween the two feedback modes, the focus of this study, has been neglected in\nprevious works. Significant differences in the kinetic feedback mode are found\nas a result of the stronger Compton heating and accretion becomes more chaotic.\nMore importantly, if we constrain models to correctly predict black hole growth\nand AGN duty cycle after cosmological evolution, we find that the favored model\nparameters are constrained: mechanical feedback efficiency diminishes with\ndecreasing luminosity (the maximum efficiency being $\\simeq 10^{-3.5}$) and\nX-ray Compton temperature increases with decreasing luminosity, although models\nwith fixed mechanical efficiency and Compton temperature can be found that are\nsatisfactory as well.

From a\npractical view, we wish to gain the most information through as little\nmeasurements as possible for the multi-photon entanglements. The low rank\nmatrix recovery (LRMR) provides such a possibility to resolve all the issues of\nthe measurement matrix based on less data. In this paper, we would like to\nverify that whether the LRMR works for six qubits and eight photons in\ncomparison to the data given by Pan's group, i.e. we input a fraction of the\ndata to calculate all of others. Through exploring their density matrix,\nfidelity and visibility, we find that the results remain consistent with the\ndata provided by Pan's group, which allows us to confirm that the LRMR can\nsimplify experimental measure- ments for more photons.

This view has been challenged\nby the recent discovery of several stars with mass above 150 Msun in the R136\nregion of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Current models predict that when stars of\nthis mass leave the main sequence, their expansion is insufficient to allow\ncommon envelope evolution to efficiently reduce the orbital separation. The\nresulting black-hole--black-hole binary remains too wide to be able to coalesce\nwithin a Hubble time. If this assessment is correct, isolated very massive\nbinaries do not evolve to be gravitational-wave sources. However, other\nformation channels exist. For example, the high multiplicity of massive stars,\nand their common formation in relatively dense stellar associations, opens up\ndynamical channels for massive black hole mergers (e.g., via Kozai cycles or\nrepeated binary-single interactions). We identify key physical factors that\nshape the population of very massive black-hole--black-hole binaries.

As direct classification on such manifolds can be difficult, in this\npaper we propose to represent each manifold point as a vector of similarities\nto class representers, via a recently introduced form of Bregman matrix\ndivergence known as the Stein divergence.

While embedding into tangent spaces allows the use of existing\nEuclidean-based learning algorithms, manifold shape is only approximated which\ncan cause loss of discriminatory information.

By contrast, CHONS clusters (beta=1.4, T=19 K) combine nicely\nwith magnesium silicate (beta=2, T=18.7 K) to give a spectrum which falls well\nwithin the observational error bars (total emission cross-section at 250 mum:\n8.6 10^{-26} cm^{2} per H atom). Only 15 % of all Galactic carbon atoms are\nneeded for this purpose. The CHONS particles that were considered and described\nhave a disordered (amorphous) structure but include a sizable fraction of\naromatic rings, although they are much less graphitized than a-C:H/HAC. They\ncan be seen as one embodiment of ``astronomical graphite\" deduced earlier on\nfrom the then available astronomical observations. Grain heating by H atom\ncapture is proposed as a contributor to the observed residual emissions that do\nnot follow the dust/HI correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 08:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Our goal\nis to analyze all these data simultaneously with the new dedicated series of\nour own spectral and photometric observations from observatories widely\nseparated in longitude. We obtained new series of UBV observations at three\nobservatories separated in local time to obtain complete light curves of Y Cyg\nfor its orbital period close to 3 days.

Our analyses provide the\nmost accurate so far published value of the apsidal period of 47.805 +/- 0.030\nyrs and the following physical elements: M1=17.72+/-0.35$ Msun, M2=17.73+/-0.30\nMsun, R1=5.785+/-0.091 Rsun, and R2=5.816+/-0.063 Rsun. The disentangling thus\nresulted in the masses, which are somewhat higher than all previous\ndeterminations and virtually the same for both stars, while the light curve\nimplies a slighly higher radius and luminosity for star 2. The above empirical\nvalues imply the logarithm of the internal structure constant log k2 = -1.937.\nA comparison with Claret's stellar interior models implies an age close to 2\nmillions yrs for both stars.

We further\nestimate the instantaneous free magnetic-energy and relative magnetic-helicity\nbudgets of the entire quiet Sun, as well as the respective budgets over an\nentire solar cycle. Derived instantaneous free magnetic energy budgets and, to\na lesser extent, relative magnetic helicity budgets over the entire quiet Sun\nare comparable to the respective budgets of a sizeable active region, while\ntotal budgets within a solar cycle are found higher than previously reported.\nFree-energy budgets are comparable to the energy needed to power fine-scale\nstructures residing at the network, such as mottles and spicules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 10:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

For comparison we determine the\nUV slope of the objects, and use it to estimate their SFR_UV99 by correcting\nthe UV luminosity following Meurer et al. (1999). A comparison between SFR\nobtained through SED-fitting (SFR_fit) and the SFR_UV99 shows that the latter\nare underestimated by a factor 2-10, regardless of the assumed SFH. Other SFR\nindicators (radio, far-IR, X-ray, recombination lines) coherently indicate SFRs\na factor of 2-4 larger than SFR_UV99 and in closer agreement with SFR_fit. This\ndiscrepancy is due to the solar metallicity implied by the usual beta-A1600\nconversion factor.

Expansion is arrested when matter reaches a minimum density and\nsubsequent emission of light from the outer region leads to compression and\nrarefaction of the inner bodily mass so as to create nine celestial spheres,\nwith an imperfect residual core.

The equations which\ndescribe the coupling of light and matter are solved numerically, subject to\ninitial conditions and critical criteria consistent with the text.

Years later, Hardy proposed a test for nonlocality\nwithout inequality, which is a kind of \"something-versus-nothing\" argument.\nHardy's test for $n$ particles induces an $n$-partite Bell's inequality with\ntwo dichotomic local measurements for each observer, which has been shown to be\nviolated by all entangled pure states. Our first result is to show that the\nBell-Hardy inequality arising form Hardy's nonlocality test is tight for an\narbitrary number of parties, i.e., it defines a facet of the Bell polytope in\nthe given scenario. On the other hand quantum theory is not that nonlocal since\nit forbids signaling and even not as nonlocal as allowed by non-signaling\nconditions, i.e., quantum mechanical predictions form a strict subset of the so\ncalled non-signaling polytope. In the scenario of each observer measuring two\ndichotomic observables, Fritz established a duality between the Bell polytope\nand the non-signaling polytope: tight Bell's inequalities, the facets of the\nBell polytope, are in a one-to-one correspondence with extremal non-signaling\nboxes, the vertices of the non-signaling polytope.

However, geochemical evidence requiring\na terrestrial magma ocean is scarce. Here we present evidence for at least two\nseparate magma ocean outgassing episodes on Earth based on the ratio of\nprimordial 3He to 22Ne in the present-day mantle. We demonstrate that the\ndepleted mantle 3He/22Ne ratio is at least 10 while a more primitive mantle\nreservoir has a 3He/22Ne ratio of 2.3 to 3. The 3He/22Ne ratios of the mantle\nreservoirs are higher than possible sources of terrestrial volatiles, including\nthe solar nebula ratio of 1.5. Therefore, a planetary process must have raised\nthe mantle's 3He/22Ne ratio. We show that long-term plate tectonic cycling is\nincapable of raising the mantle 3He/22Ne ratio and may even lower it. However,\ningassing of a gravitationally accreted nebular atmosphere into a magma ocean\non the proto-Earth explains the 3He/22Ne and 20Ne/22Ne ratios of the primitive\nmantle reservoir. Increasing the mantle 3He/22Ne ratio to a value of 10 in the\ndepleted mantle requires at least two episodes of atmospheric blow-off and\nmagma ocean outgassing associated with giant impacts during subsequent\nterrestrial accretion. The preservation of a low 3He/22Ne ratio in a primitive\nreservoir sampled by plumes suggests that the later giant impacts, including\nthe Moon-forming giant impact, did not generate a whole mantle magma ocean.\nAtmospheric loss episodes associated with giant impacts provide an explanation\nfor Earth's subchondritic C/H, N/H, and Cl/F elemental ratios while preserving\nchondritic isotopic ratios. If so, a significant proportion of terrestrial\nwater and potentially other major volatiles were accreted prior to the last\ngiant impact, otherwise the fractionated elemental ratios would have been\noverprinted by the late veneer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 15:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-02"}

The dependence of\nseveral parameters on initial rotation is studied. These parameters include\nmass, luminosity, temperature, lifetimes, equatorial velocity, surface\nabundances, and rates of period change. Several key results are obtained: i)\nmass-luminosity (M-L) relations depend on rotation, particularly during the\nblue loop phase; ii) luminosity increases between crossings of the IS. Hence,\nCepheid M-L relations at fixed initial rotation rate depend on crossing number\n(faster rotation yields greater luminosity difference between crossings); iii)\nthe Cepheid mass discrepancy problem vanishes when rotation and crossing number\nare taken into account, without a need for high core overshooting values or\nenhanced mass loss; iv) rotation creates dispersion around average parameters\npredicted at fixed mass and metallicity.

We show that the\ncombined pollution of AGB stars with mass ranging between 3 to 6 M$_\\odot$ may\naccount for most of the features of the s-process overabundance in M4 and M22.\nIn these stars, the s process is a mixture of two different neutron-capture\nnucleosynthesis episodes.

The second is due to the\n22Ne(a,n)25Mg reaction and takes place in the convective zones generated by\nthermal pulses. The production of the heaviest s elements (from Ba to Pb)\nrequires the first neutron burst, while the second produces large\noverabundances of light s (Sr, Y, Zr). The first mainly operates in the\nless-massive AGB stars, while the second dominates in the more-massive. From\nthe heavy-s/light-s ratio, we derive that the pollution phase should last for\n$150\\pm 50$ Myr, a period short enough compared to the formation timescale of\nthe Globular Cluster system, but long enough to explain why the s-process\npollution is observed in a few cases only.

The data was reduced using the Comprehensive Reduction Utility for\nSHARC-II (CRUSH). The flux density map was analyzed using the GaussClumps\nalgorithm, within which 75 cores has been identified. We used the Spitzer c2d\ncatalogs to separate the cores into 63 starless cores and 12 protostellar\ncores. By locating Jeans instabilities, 55 prestellar cores (a subcategory of\nstarless cores) were also identified. The excitation temperatures, which were\nderived from FCRAO ${}^{12}$CO data, help to improve the accuracy of the masses\nof the cores. We adopted a Monte Carlo approach to analyze the CMF with two\ntypes of functional forms; power law and log-normal. The whole and prestellar\nCMF are both well fitted by a log-normal distribution, with $\\mu\n=-1.18\\pm0.10,\\ \\sigma =0.58\\pm0.05$ and $\\mu =1.40\\pm0.10,\\ \\sigma\n=0.50\\pm0.05$ respectively. This finding suggests that turbulence influences\nthe evolution of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 15:56:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Mar 2014 05:18:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 11:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 9 Apr 2014 17:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-10"}

However, this rapid\nemergence of high-z galaxies, barely ~ 200 Myr after the transition from\nPopulation III star formation to Population II, appears to be in conflict with\nthe standard view of how the early Universe evolved. This problem has much in\ncommon with the better known (and probably related) premature appearance of\nsupermassive black holes at z ~ 6. It is difficult to understand how ~ 10^9\nsolar-mass black holes could have appeared so quickly after the big bang\nwithout invoking non-standard accretion physics and the formation of massive\nseeds, neither of which is seen in the local Universe. In earlier work, we\nshowed that the appearance of high-z quasars could instead be understood more\nreasonably in the context of the R_h=ct Universe, which does not suffer from\nthe same time compression issues as LCDM does at early epochs. Here, we build\non that work by demonstrating that the evolutionary growth of primordial\ngalaxies was consistent with the current view of how the first stars formed,\nbut only with the timeline afforded by the R_h=ct cosmology. We also show that\nthe growth of high-z quasars was mutually consistent with that of the earliest\ngalaxies, though it is not yet clear whether the former grew from 5-20\nsolar-mass seeds created in Population III or Population II supernova\nexplosions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2014 20:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

In this paper, we propose a multichannel\nobstructed link detection method based on the RSS variation on difference\nchannels. Multichannel detection is proved to be very effective in multipath\nenvironments compared to the single channel detection. We also propose a new\nlocalization method termed as robust weighted least square (RWLS) method. RWLS\nfirst use spatial property to eliminate the interference links and then employ\nWLS method to localize the target. Since the spatial detection relies on the\nunknown position of the target. A coarse position estimation of target is also\npresented. RWLS is robust to interference links and has low computation\ncomplexity.
