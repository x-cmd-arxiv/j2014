In general, such complexity is seen to increase with the\ncomplexity of the organism, with a concomitant increase of the accuracy and\nspecificity of the cellular processes. The question thus arises how the\ncomplexification of systems - modeled here by simple interacting birth-death\ntype processes - can lead to a reduction of the noise - described by the\nvariance of the number of molecules. To gain understanding of this issue, we\ninvestigated the difference between a single system containing molecules that\nare produced and degraded, and the same system - with the same average number\nof molecules - connected to a buffer. We modeled these systems using Ito\nstochastic differential equations in discrete time, as they allow\nstraightforward analytical developments. In general, when the molecules in the\nsystem and the buffer are positively correlated, the variance on the number of\nmolecules in the system is found to decrease compared to the equivalent system\nwithout a buffer. Only buffers that are too noisy by themselves tend to\nincrease the noise in the main system. We tested this result on two model\ncases, in which the system and the buffer contain proteins in their active and\ninactive state, or protein monomers and homodimers. We found that in the second\ntest case, where the interconversion terms are non-linear in the number of\nmolecules, the noise reduction is much more pronounced; it reaches up to 20%\nreduction of the Fano factor with the parameter values tested in numerical\nsimulations on an unperturbed birth-death model. We extended our analysis to\ntwo arbitrary interconnected systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 16:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

A statistical Pearson's coefficients\nanalysis is used to study the correlation between the column densities and the\nintensity of the IR emission. This analysis provides evidence that the\n2$\\times$2 square degree field under consideration is characterized by the\npresence of a gas component not accounted for by the standard tracers, possibly\nassociated with warm H$_{2}$ and cold HI.

Previous approaches\nfor protecting networks from DoS attacks are reactive in that they wait for an\nattack to be launched before taking appropriate measures to protect the\nnetwork. This leaves the door open for other attacks that use more\nsophisticated methods to mask their traffic. A secure overlay services (SOS)\narchitecture has been proposed to provide reliable communication between\nclients and a target under DoS attacks. The SOS architecture employs a set of\noverlay nodes arranged in three hierarchical layers that controls access to the\ntarget. We propose an architecture called secure overlay services (SOS) that\nproactively prevents denial of service (DoS) attacks, which works toward\nsupporting emergency services, or similar types of communication. The\narchitecture uses a combination of secure overlay tunneling, routing via\nconsistent hashing, and filtering. We reduce the probability of successful\nattacks by: 1) performing intensive filtering near protected network edges,\npushing the attack point into the core of the network, where high-speed routers\ncan handle the volume of attack traffic and 2) introducing randomness and\nanonymity into the forwarding architecture, making it difficult for an attacker\nto target nodes along the path to a specific SOSprotected destination. Using\nsimple analytical models, we evaluate the likelihood that an attacker can\nsuccessfully launch a DoS attack against an SOS protected network. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that such an architecture reduces the likelihood of a successful\nattack to minuscule levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 17:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

However, some objects contain components with very different spectral\nenergy distributions (SED; i.e. different temperatures), which produces strong\nchromatic effects on the interferograms that have to be managed with care by\nimage reconstruction algorithms. For example, the gray approximation for the\nimage reconstruction process results in a degraded image if the total (u,\nv)-coverage given by the spectral supersynthesis is used. The relative flux\ncontribution of the central object and an extended structure changes with\nwavelength for different temperatures. For young stellar objects, the known\ncharacteristics of the central object (i.e., stellar SED), or even the fit of\nthe spectral index and the relative flux ratio, can be used to model the\ncentral star while reconstructing the image of the extended structure\nseparately. Methods. We present a new method, called SPARCO (semi-parametric\nalgorithm for the image reconstruction of chromatic objects), which describes\nthe spectral characteristics of both the central object and the extended\nstructure to consider them properly when reconstructing the image of the\nsurrounding environment. We adapted two image-reconstruction codes (Macim,\nSqueeze, and MiRA) to implement this new prescription.

By using a variational approach, and by\nchoosing an appropriate trial wave function, we reformulate the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation with spherical symmetry as Newton's equation of\nmotion for a particle in an effective potential, which is determined by the\nzero point kinetic energy, the gravitational energy, and the particles\ninteraction energy, respectively. The velocity of the condensate is\nproportional to the radial distance, with a time dependent proportionality\nfunction. The equation of motion of the collapsing dark matter condensate is\nstudied by using both analytical and numerical methods. The collapse of the\ncondensate ends with the formation of a stable configuration, corresponding to\nthe minimum of the effective potential. The radius and the mass of the\nresulting dark matter object are obtained, as well as the collapse time of the\ncondensate.

We impose the feedback loop by balancing radiative cooling with\nturbulent heating. In addition to heating the plasma, turbulence also mixes it,\nsuppressing the formation of cold gas at small scales. In this regard, the\neffect of turbulence is analogous to thermal conduction. For uniform plasma in\nthermal balance (turbulent heating balancing radiative cooling), cold gas\ncondenses only if the cooling time is shorter than the mixing time. This\ncondition requires the turbulent kinetic energy to be $\\gtrsim$ the plasma\ninternal energy; such high velocities in cool cores are ruled out by\nobservations. The results with realistic magnetic fields and thermal conduction\nare qualitatively similar to the hydrodynamic simulations.

Specifically, we use the \"position-dependent\npower spectrum,\" i.e., the power spectrum measured in smaller subvolumes of the\nsurvey (or simulation box), and correlate it with the mean overdensity of the\ncorresponding subvolume. This correlation directly measures an integral of the\nbispectrum dominated by the squeezed configurations.

We use multiwavelength COSMOS photometry, HST-ACS I-band\nimaging and optical zCOSMOS spectroscopy to derive the main global properties\nof EELGs, such as sizes, masses, SFRs, reliable metallicities from both\n\"direct\" and \"strong-line\" methods. The EELGs are compact (R_50 ~ 1.3 kpc),\nlow-mass (log(M*/Msol)~7-10) galaxies forming stars at unusually high specific\nSFR (log(sSFR/yr) up to ~ -7) compared to main sequence SFGs of the same\nstellar mass and redshift. At UV wavelengths, the EELGs are luminous and show\nhigh surface brightness and include strong Ly$\\alpha$ emitters, as revealed by\nGALEX spectroscopy. We show that zCOSMOS EELGs are high-ionization,\nlow-metallicity systems, with median 12+log(O/H)=8.16, including a handful of\nextremely metal-deficient galaxies (<10% solar). While ~80% of the EELGs show\nnon-axisymmetric morphologies, including clumpy and tadpole galaxies, we find\nthat ~29% of them show additional low surface-brightness features, which\nstrongly suggest recent or ongoing interactions. As star-forming dwarfs in the\nlocal Universe, EELGs are most often found in relative isolation. While only\nvery few EELGs belong to compact groups, almost one third of them are found in\nspectroscopically confirmed loose pairs or triplets. We conclude that EELGs are\ngalaxies caught in a transient and probably early period of their evolution,\nwhere they are efficiently building-up a significant fraction of their\npresent-day stellar mass in an ongoing galaxy-wide starburst. Therefore, the\nEELGs constitute an ideal benchmark for comparison studies between low- and\nhigh-redshift low-mass star-forming galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 21:35:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2015 12:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-17"}

The question of how closely the effects of\ngenetic variation on protein levels mirror those on mRNA levels remains open.\nHere, we addressed this question by using ribosome profiling to examine how\ngenetic differences between two strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae affect\ntranslation. Strain differences in translation were observed for hundreds of\ngenes. Allele specific measurements in the diploid hybrid between the two\nstrains revealed roughly half as many cis-acting effects on translation as were\nobserved for mRNA levels. In both the parents and the hybrid, most effects on\ntranslation were of small magnitude, such that the direction of an mRNA\ndifference was typically reflected in a concordant footprint difference. The\nrelative importance of cis and trans acting variation on footprint levels was\nsimilar to that for mRNA levels. There was a tendency for translation to cause\nlarger footprint differences than expected given the respective mRNA\ndifferences. This is in contrast to translational differences between yeast\nspecies that have been reported to more often oppose than reinforce mRNA\ndifferences. Finally, we catalogued instances of premature translation\ntermination in the two yeast strains and also found several instances where\nerroneous reference gene annotations lead to apparent nonsense mutations that\nin fact reside outside of the translated gene body.

In four\ndimensions, the geometry is selfdual conformal geometry and the gauge theory is\nselfdual Yang-Mills theory, while the lower-dimensional structures are\nnondegenerate (i.e., non-null) reductions of this. Any solution of the gauge\ntheory on a $k$-dimensional geometry, such that the gauge group $H$ acts\ntransitively on an $\\ell$-manifold, determines a $(k+\\ell)$-dimensional\ngeometry ($k+\\ell\\leqslant4$) fibering over the $k$-dimensional geometry with\n$H$ as a structure group.

Together with the application of a\nhyperbolically reduced basis, this reduces the computational effort\nconsiderably and helps cope with the infamous curse of dimensionality. The\napplication of the fast algorithm is limited to the case of the potential being\nsignificantly smoother than the solution. The error analysis is based on a\nbinary tree representation of the three-term recurrence relation for the\none-dimensional Hermite functions. The fast algorithm constitutes an efficient\ntool for schemes involving the action of a matrix due to spectral\ndiscretization on a vector, and it is also applicable in the context of\nspectral approximations for linear problems other than the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 09:09:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Aug 2014 12:50:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 May 2015 06:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-14"}

Turbulence creates large density inhomogeneities, allowing\nradiation to penetrate deeply into the clouds. As a result, [CI] emitting gas\nis found throughout the cloud, rather than being concentrated at the edges. We\nexamine how well we can use [CI] emission to trace the structure of the cloud,\nand show that the integrated intensity of the 609 micron line traces column\ndensity accurately over a wide range of visual extinctions. For extinctions\ngreater than a few, [CI] and 13CO both perform well, but [CI] becomes a\nsuperior tracer of column densities for visual extinctions A_V <= 3\n  We have also studied the distribution of [CI] excitation temperatures in the\ngas, and show that these are typically smaller than the kinetic temperature,\nindicating that most of the carbon atoms are not in local thermodynamic\nequilibrium. We discuss how best to determine T_ex from observations of the\n[CI] lines, and how to use these values to estimate the column density of\nneutral atomic carbon. We show that even in the best case, we tend to\nsystematically underestimate the atomic carbon content of the gas. Our results\nsuggest that observationally-derived estimates of the atomic carbon content of\nreal GMCs could be in error by as much as a factor of two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 11:12:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 2015 21:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In\nparticular, our findings fully agree with previous results in the literature\nthat calculate transport using linear response theory (zero-bias) or the master\nequation (high bias). Our $I-V$ curves reveal a characteristic slope given by\n$I=(G_{0}/2)V$ in linear response regime, where $G_0$ is the ballistic\nconductance $e^{2}/h$ as predicted in Phys. Rev.

A\nmajor reason in favor of our conclusion is that any definition of signalling or\nof non-signalling invariably requires a reference to epistemic agents, and what\nthese agents can actually measure and report; otherwise, the non-signalling\ntheorem would equal a general \"no-influence\" theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 14:39:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-30"}

We show that the $0-1$ loss, sigmoid loss, ramp loss and\nprobit loss satisfy this condition though none of the standard convex loss\nfunctions satisfy it. We also prove that, by choosing a sufficiently large\nvalue of a parameter in the loss function, the sigmoid loss, ramp loss and\nprobit loss can be made tolerant to non-uniform label noise also if we can\nassume the classes to be separable under noise-free data distribution.

We aim to constrain the mass profile, M(r), and\ndynamical status of the $z \\sim 0.8$ LCDCS 0504 cluster of galaxies\ncharacterized by prominent giant gravitational arcs near its center. Our\nanalysis is based on deep X-ray, optical, and infrared imaging, as well as\noptical spectroscopy. We model the mass distribution of the cluster with three\ndifferent mass density profiles, whose parameters are constrained by the strong\nlensing features of the inner cluster region, by the X-ray emission from the\nintra-cluster medium, and by the kinematics of 71 cluster members. We obtain\nconsistent M(r) determinations from three methods (dispersion-kurtosis,\ncaustics and MAMPOSSt), out to the cluster virial radius and beyond. The mass\nprofile inferred by the strong lensing analysis in the central cluster region\nis slightly above, but still consistent with, the kinematics estimate. On the\nother hand, the X-ray based M(r) is significantly below both the kinematics and\nstrong lensing estimates. Theoretical predictions from $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology\nfor the concentration--mass relation are in agreement with our observational\nresults, when taking into account the uncertainties in both the observational\nand theoretical estimates. There appears to be a central deficit in the\nintra-cluster gas mass fraction compared to nearby clusters. Despite the\nrelaxed appearance of this cluster, the determinations of its mass profile by\ndifferent probes show substantial discrepancies, the origin of which remains to\nbe determined. The extension of a similar dynamical analysis to other clusters\nof the DAFT/FADA survey will allow to shed light on the possible systematics\nthat affect the determination of mass profiles of high-z clusters, possibly\nrelated to our incomplete understanding of intracluster baryon physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 15:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

(2008) had identified as a candidate system for containing two\nclassical Cepheids in orbit. Our spectroscopic data clearly demonstrate binary\nmotion of the Cepheids in a 413-day eccentric orbit, rendering this eclipsing\nbinary system the first ever known to consist of two classical Cepheid\nvariables. After disentangling the four different radial velocity variations in\nthe system we present the orbital solution and the individual pulsational\nradial velocity curves of the Cepheids. We show that both Cepheids are\nextremely likely to be first overtone pulsators and determine their respective\ndynamical masses, which turn out to be equal to within 1.5 %. Since the\nsecondary eclipse is not observed in the orbital light curve we cannot derive\nthe individual radii of the Cepheids, but the sum of their radii derived from\nthe photometry is consistent with overtone pulsation for both variables.\n  The existence of two equal-mass Cepheids in a binary system having different\npulsation periods (1.96 and 2.48 days, respectively) may pose an interesting\nchallenge to stellar evolution and pulsation theories, and a more detailed\nstudy of this system using additional datasets should yield deeper insight\nabout the physics of stellar evolution of Cepheid variables. Future analysis of\nthe system using additional near-infrared photometry might also lead to a\nbetter understanding of the systematic uncertainties in current Baade-Wesselink\ntechniques of distance determinations to Cepheid variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Mar 2014 15:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

The\nmagnetic response of such systems results both, frombulk contributions and from\nconfinement effects that can be particularly strong in ballistic quantum dots.\nFirst we provide a comprehensive study of the magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$ of\nbulk graphene in a magnetic field for the different regimes arising from the\nrelative magnitudes of the energy scales involved, i.e. temperature, Landau\nlevel spacing and chemical potential. We show that for finite temperature or\nchemical potential, $\\chi$ is not divergent although the diamagnetic\ncontribution $\\chi_{0}$ from the filled valance band exhibits the well-known\n$-B^{-1/2}$ dependence. We further derive oscillatory modulations of $\\chi$,\ncorresponding to de Haas-van Alphen oscillations of conventional\ntwo-dimensional electron gases. These oscillations can be large in graphene,\nthereby compensating the diamagnetic contribution $\\chi_{0}$ and yielding a net\nparamagnetic susceptibility for certain energy and magnetic field regimes.\nSecond, we predict and analyze corresponding strong, confinement-induced\nsusceptibility oscillations in graphene-based quantum dots with amplitudes\ndistincly exceeding the corresponding bulk susceptibility. Within a\nsemiclassical approach we derive generic expressions for orbital magnetism of\ngraphene quantum dots with regular classical dynamics. Graphene-specific\nfeatures can be traced back to pseudospin interference along the underlying\nperiodic orbits. We demonstrate the quality of the semiclassical approximation\nby comparison with quantum mechanical results for two exemplary mesoscopic\nsystems, a graphene disk with infinite mass-type edges and a rectangular\ngraphene structure with armchair and zigzag edges, using numerical\ntight-binding calculations in the latter case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 20:17:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 16:16:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 08:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

Most studies have relied on\nindividual analysts who map and identify craters and interpret crater\nstatistics. However, little work has been done to determine how the counts vary\nas a function of technique, terrain, or between researchers. Furthermore,\nseveral novel internet-based projects ask volunteers with little to no training\nto identify craters, and it was unclear how their results compare against the\ntypical professional researcher. To better understand the variation among\nexperts and to compare with volunteers, eight professional researchers have\nidentified impact features in two separate regions of the moon. Small craters\n(diameters ranging from 10 m to 500 m) were measured on a lunar mare region and\nlarger craters (100s m to a few km in diameter) were measured on both lunar\nhighlands and maria. Volunteer data were collected for the small craters on the\nmare. Our comparison shows that the level of agreement among experts depends on\ncrater diameter, number of craters per diameter bin, and terrain type, with\ndifferences of up to $\\sim\\pm45%$. We also found artifacts near the minimum\ncrater diameter that was studied. These results indicate that caution must be\nused in most cases when interpreting small variations in crater size-frequency\ndistributions and for craters $\\le10$ pixels across. Because of the natural\nvariability found, projects that emphasize many people identifying craters on\nthe same area and using a consensus result are likely to yield the most\nconsistent and robust information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 20:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-07"}
