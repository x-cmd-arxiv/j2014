The dijets are modeled as external sources in the\nenergy-momentum conservation equations for hydrodynamics, which are solved on\nan event-by-event basis within the ideal fluid approximation. We focus our\ninvestigation at mid-rapidity and solve the hydrodynamic equations imposing\nboost invariance. Differential anisotropic flow coefficients for $p_T \\gtrsim\n1$ GeV are found to be significantly enhanced if the dijets deposit on average\nmore than 12 GeV in the QGP (or more than 6 GeV per jet). Because this\njet-induced extra anisotropic flow is not related to the fluctuations of the\ninitial geometry of the collision, the correlation between the $v_2$ and $v_3$\ncoefficients and their corresponding eccentricities is considerably weakened.\nIn addition, we argue that the extra amount of direct flow induced by dijets\nmay be quantified by comparing the azimuthal dependence of dihadron\ncorrelations in dijet events with the corresponding quantity obtained in events\nwithout dijets. This comparison could be used to give a rough estimate of the\nmagnitude of the effective coupling between the jets and the medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2014 16:03:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-10"}

We analyze a model of trait evolution under mutations and genetic\ndrift in a single-peak fitness seascape.

From an\ninformation-theoretic point of view, this function measures the\nmacro-evolutionary entropy in a population ensemble, which determines the\npredictability of the evolutionary process.

In contrast, in the disc\ninstability paradigm, giant planet formation is believed to be independent of\ncore formation: massive self-gravitating gas fragments cool radiatively and\ncollapse as a whole. We show that giant planet formation in the disc\ninstability model may be also enhanced by core formation for reasons physically\nvery similar to the CA paradigm. In the model explored here, efficient grain\nsedimentation within an initial fragment (rather than the disc) leads to the\nformation of a core composed of heavy elements. We find that massive\natmospheres form around cores and undergo collapse as a critical core mass is\nexceeded, analogous to CA theory. The critical mass of the core to initiate\nsuch a collapse depends on the fragment mass and metallicity, as well as core\nluminosity, but ranges from less than 1 to as much as $\\sim80$ Earth masses.

For a proportion of events the relation derived\nbetween the starting height (frequency) of type III radio bursts and the\nelectron beam velocity spectral index (deduced from X-rays) is used to infer\nthe spatial properties (height and size) of the electron beam acceleration\nregion. Both quantities can be related to the distance travelled before an\nelectron beam becomes unstable to Langmuir waves. To obtain a list of suitable\nevents we considered the RHESSI catalogue of X-ray flares and the Phoenix 2\ncatalogue of type III radio bursts. From the 200 events that showed both type\nIII and X-ray signatures, we selected 30 events which had simultaneous emission\nin both wavelengths, good signal to noise in the X-ray domain and > 20 seconds\nduration. We find that > 50 % of the selected events show a good correlation\nbetween the starting frequencies of the groups of type III bursts and the hard\nX-ray spectral indices. A low-high-low trend for the starting frequency of type\nIII bursts is frequently observed. Assuming a background electron density model\nand the thick target approximation for X-ray observations, this leads to a\ncorrelation between starting heights of the type III emission and the beam\nelectron spectral index. Using this correlation we infer the altitude and\nvertical extents of the flare acceleration regions. We find heights from 183 Mm\ndown to 25 Mm while the sizes range from 13 Mm to 2 Mm. These values agree with\nprevious work that places an extended flare acceleration region high in the\ncorona. We analyse the assumptions required and explore possible extensions to\nour assumed model. We discuss these results with respect to the acceleration\nheights and sizes derived from X-ray observations alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2014 19:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

Once the additional phase shift for two photons reaches pi, such\nan ultra-strong nonlinearity could even enable the direct implementation of\nhigh-fidelity quantum logic operations.

Both PMUs\nand state estimators are prone to false data injection attacks. Thus, it is\ncrucial to have a mechanism for fast and accurate detection of an agent\nmaliciously tampering with the data---for both preventing attacks that may lead\nto blackouts, and for routine monitoring and control tasks of current and\nfuture grids. We propose a decentralized false data injection detection scheme\nbased on Markov graph of the bus phase angles. We utilize the Conditional\nCovariance Test (CCT) to learn the structure of the grid. Using the DC power\nflow model, we show that under normal circumstances, and because of\nwalk-summability of the grid graph, the Markov graph of the voltage angles can\nbe determined by the power grid graph. Therefore, a discrepancy between\ncalculated Markov graph and learned structure should trigger the alarm. Local\ngrid topology is available online from the protection system and we exploit it\nto check for mismatch. Should a mismatch be detected, we use correlation\nanomaly score to detect the set of attacked nodes.

Furthermore, the origin of three\ngenerations of neutrinos(assuming they are Majorana fermions) can be naturally\nexplained as three distinguishable ways to form a pair of (local) complex\nfermions out of four Majorana zero modes. Finally, we compute the neutrino mass\nmixing matrix and mass ratios of the three mass eigenstates from a first\nprinciple at leading order(in the absence of $CP$ violation and charged lepton\ncorrections). We obtain $\\theta_{12} =31.7^\\circ$, $\\theta_{23}=45^\\circ$,\n$\\theta_{13}=0^\\circ$ and $m_1/m_3=m_2/m_3=3/\\sqrt{5}$.

The\nproperties of the oscillation frequency power spectrum can be tied to mass and\nradius through solar-scaled asteroseismic relations. Stellar properties derived\nusing these scaling relations need verification over a range of metallicities.\nBecause the age and mass of halo stars are well-constrained by astrophysical\npriors, they provide an independent, empirical check on asteroseismic mass\nestimates in the low-metallicity regime.

The resulting asymmetry is\nstationary, it does not orbit the star. The debris is concentrated in a clump\nat the collision-point, with a more diffuse structure on the opposite side. The\nasymmetry lasts for typically around 1000 orbital periods of the progenitor,\nwhich can be several Myr at distances of ~50 AU. We describe how the appearance\nof the asymmetric disc depends on the mass and eccentricity of the progenitor,\nas well as viewing orientation. The wavelength of observation, which determines\nthe grain sizes probed, is also important.

Solutions of these equations have been typically worked out assuming\nthat either the time (in the core-collapse supernova environment) or space (in\nthe early universe) homogeneity in the initial conditions is preserved through\nthe evolution. In these cases one can gauge away the homogeneous variable and\nreduce the dimensionality of the problem. In this paper we investigate if small\ndeviations from an initial postulated homogeneity can be amplified by the\ninteracting neutrino gas, leading to a new flavor instability. To this end, we\nconsider a simple two flavor isotropic neutrino gas evolving in time, and\ninitially composed by only $\\nu_e$ and $\\bar\\nu_e$ with equal densities. In the\nhomogeneous case, this system shows a bimodal instability in the inverted mass\nhierarchy scheme, leading to the well studied flavor pendulum behavior. This\nwould lead to periodic pair conversions $\\nu_e \\bar\\nu_e \\leftrightarrow \\nu_x\n\\bar\\nu_x$. To break space homogeneity, we introduce small amplitude\nspace-dependent perturbations in the matter potential. By Fourier transforming\nthe equations of motion with respect to the space coordinate, we then\nnumerically solve a set of coupled equations for the different Fourier modes.\nWe find that even for arbitrarily tiny inhomogeneities, the system evolution\nruns away from the stable pendulum behavior: the different modes are excited\nand the space-averaged ensemble evolves towards flavor equilibrium.

Among several sparsity models,\ntree-structured sparsity provides a flexible framework for extraction of\ncross-correlated information from different sources and for enforcing group\nsparsity at multiple granularities. However, the existing algorithm only solves\nan approximated version of the cost functional and the resulting solution is\nnot necessarily sparse at group levels. This paper reformulates the\ntree-structured sparse model for multimodal classification task. An accelerated\nproximal algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem, which is an\nefficient tool for feature-level fusion among either homogeneous or\nheterogeneous sources of information. In addition, a (fuzzy-set-theoretic)\npossibilistic scheme is proposed to weight the available modalities, based on\ntheir respective reliability, in a joint optimization problem for finding the\nsparsity codes. This approach provides a general framework for quality-based\nfusion that offers added robustness to several sparsity-based multimodal\nclassification algorithms. To demonstrate their efficacy, the proposed methods\nare evaluated on three different applications - multiview face recognition,\nmultimodal face recognition, and target classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2014 00:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-04"}

Multiple systems are widely agreed to result from the collapse and\nfragmentation of cloud cores, despite the inhibiting influence of magnetic\nfields. Surveys of Class 0 protostars with mm interferometers have revealed a\nvery high multiplicity frequency of about 2/3, even though there are\nobservational difficulties in resolving close protobinaries, thus supporting\nthe possibility that all stars could be born in multiple systems. Near-infrared\nadaptive optics observations of Class I protostars show a lower binary\nfrequency relative to the Class 0 phase, a declining trend that continues\nthrough the Class II/III stages to the field population. This loss of\ncompanions is a natural consequence of dynamical interplay in small multiple\nsystems, leading to ejection of members. We discuss observational consequences\nof this dynamical evolution, and its influence on circumstellar disks, and we\nreview the evolution of circumbinary disks and their role in defining binary\nmass ratios. Special attention is paid to eclipsing PMS binaries, which allow\nfor observational tests of evolutionary models of early stellar evolution. Many\nstars are born in clusters and small groups, and we discuss how interactions in\ndense stellar environments can significantly alter the distribution of binary\nseparations through dissolution of wider binaries. The binaries and multiples\nwe find in the field are the survivors of these internal and external\ndestructive processes, and we provide a detailed overview of the multiplicity\nstatistics of the field, which form a boundary condition for all models of\nbinary evolution.

Today, they are increasingly created and used with mobile\ntext entry methods, such as touchscreens and mobile keyboards, in addition to\ntraditional physical keyboards. This raises a foundational question for usable\nsecurity: whether text entry methods affect password generation and password\nsecurity. This paper presents results from a between-group study with 63\nparticipants, in which each group generated passwords for multiple virtual\naccounts using a different text entry method. Participants were also asked to\nrecall their passwords afterwards. We applied analysis of structures and\nprobabilities, with standard and recent security metrics and also performed\ncracking attacks on the collected data. The results show a significant effect\nof text entry methods on passwords. In particular, one of the experimental\ngroups created passwords with significantly more lowercase letters per password\nthan the control group ($t(60) = 2.99, p = 0.004$). The choices for character\ntypes in each group were also significantly different ($p=0.048, FET$). Our\ncracking attacks consequently expose significantly different resistance across\ngroups ($p=0.031, FET$) and text entry method vulnerabilities. Our findings\ncontribute to the understanding of password security in the context of usable\ninterfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2014 01:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-11"}

Several applications such as finding\npatient-disease cohorts in health care analysis, finding user-genre groups in\nrecommendation systems and community detection problems can benefit from\nco-clustering technique that utilizes the predictive power of the data to\ngenerate co-clusters for improved data analysis.\n  In this paper, we present the novel idea of Predictive Overlapping\nCo-Clustering (POCC) as an optimization problem for a more effective and\nimproved predictive analysis. Our algorithm generates optimal co-clusters by\nmaximizing predictive power of the co-clusters subject to the constraints on\nthe number of row and column clusters. In this paper precision, recall and\nf-measure have been used as evaluation measures of the resulting co-clusters.\nResults of our algorithm has been compared with two other well-known techniques\n- K-means and Spectral co-clustering, over four real data set namely, Leukemia,\nInternet-Ads, Ovarian cancer and MovieLens data set. The results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and utility of our algorithm POCC in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2014 07:07:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 20:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

To this end, many algorithms have been developed to classify\nmulti-label data in an effective manner. However, they usually do not consider\nthe pairwise relations indicated by sample labels, which actually play\nimportant roles in multi-label classification. Inspired by this, we naturally\nextend the traditional pairwise constraints to the multi-label scenario via a\nflexible thresholding scheme. Moreover, to improve the generalization ability\nof the classifier, we adopt a boosting-like strategy to construct a multi-label\nensemble from a group of base classifiers. To achieve these goals, this paper\npresents a novel multi-label classification framework named Variable Pairwise\nConstraint projection for Multi-label Ensemble (VPCME). Specifically, we take\nadvantage of the variable pairwise constraint projection to learn a\nlower-dimensional data representation, which preserves the correlations between\nsamples and labels. Thereafter, the base classifiers are trained in the new\ndata space. For the boosting-like strategy, we employ both the variable\npairwise constraints and the bootstrap steps to diversify the base classifiers.\nEmpirical studies have shown the superiority of the proposed method in\ncomparison with other approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2014 07:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-11"}

This is motivated by a new integro-differential\nrepresentation for nonlinear operators with a comparison principle which we\nalso introduce. In the simple case that the original domain is an infinite\nstrip with almost periodic Neumann data, this leads to an almost periodic\nhomogenization problem involving a fully nonlinear integro-differential\noperator on the Neumann boundary. This method gives a new proof-- which was\nleft as an open question in the earlier work of Barles- Da Lio- Lions-\nSouganidis (2008)- of the result obtained recently by Choi-Kim-Lee (2013), and\nwe anticipate that it will generalize to other contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2014 15:53:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Sep 2014 06:47:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 00:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-24"}

The method uses combination of sample\ndomain filtering and resampling to refine the sample domain and two feature\nsubset evaluation methods to select reliable features. This method utilizes\nboth feature space and sample domain in two phases. The first phase filters and\nresamples the sample domain and the second phase adopts a hybrid procedure by\ninformation gain, wrapper subset evaluation and genetic search to find the\noptimal feature space. Experiments carried out on different types of datasets\nfrom UCI Repository of Machine Learning databases and the results show a rise\nin the average performance of five classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic,\nMultilayer Perceptron, Best First Decision Tree and JRIP) simultaneously and\nthe classification error for these classifiers decreases considerably.
