This workflow runs\nthe ESO public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the Gaia-ESO Survey,\nperforms automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction and\nnormalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of the\nrotational velocities. The quality control is performed using the output\nparameters from the ESO pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and by\nthe analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.\n  Using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observed\nmultiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both GIRAFFE and UVES,\nand observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision and\nthe accuracy of the radial velocities. The statistical error on the radial\nvelocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zero\npoint of the wavelength calibration.

Our proof is strongly based on their\nresults, but it also makes use of sharp tools from the theory of homogeneous\nRicci solitons.

Certain logarithmic corrections to the quartic\nscaling of the minimum source strength with respect to the degree of\nsuperresolution characterize the signal-dominated regime, while the scaling is\npurely quadratic in the background-dominated regime.

In view of the extraordinary importance of the rGO starting material for\nthe current molecular graphene technology, the natural rGO deposits turns out\nto be quite challenging, making it highly necessary to prove the reliability of\nthe proposed rGO concept of shungite.

Contrary to what is commonly assumed, the NSEs are not the weak-field\n(WF), non-relativistic (NR) limit of the semi-classical Einstein equation (SCE)\n(this nomenclature is preferred over the `M\\/oller-Rosenfeld equation') based\non GR+QFT. The wave-function in the NSEs makes sense only as that for a mean\nfield describing a system of $N$ particles as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, not that\nof a single or finite many particles. From GR+QFT the gravitational\nself-interaction leads to mass renormalization, not to a non-linear term in the\nevolution equations of some AQTs. The WF-NR limit of the gravitational\ninteraction in GR+QFT involves no dynamics. To see the contrast, we give a\nderivation of the equation (i) governing the many-body wave function from\nGR+QFT and (ii) for the non-relativistic limit of quantum electrodynamics\n(QED). They have the same structure, being linear, and very different from\nNSEs. Adding to this our earlier consideration that for gravitational\ndecoherence the master equations based on GR+QFT lead to decoherence in the\nenergy basis and not in the position basis, despite some AQTs desiring it for\nthe `collapse of the wave function', we conclude that the origins and\nconsequences of NSEs are very different, and should be clearly demarcated from\nthose of the SCE equation, the only legitimate representative of semiclassical\ngravity, based on GR+QFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 19:36:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2014 13:25:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 27 Jul 2014 14:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We examine how the\nstellar ages and abundance patterns of galaxies evolve over time as a function\nof stellar mass from 10^{9.6}-10^{11.8} Msun. Galaxy spectra are stacked in\nbins of mass and redshift, and modeled over a wavelength range from 4000 A to\n5500 A. Full spectrum stellar population synthesis modeling provides estimates\nof the age and the abundances of the elements Fe, Mg, C, N, and Ca. We find\nnegligible evolution in elemental abundances at fixed stellar mass over roughly\n7 Gyr of cosmic time. In addition, the increase in stellar ages with time for\nmassive galaxies is consistent with passive evolution since z = 0.7. Taken\ntogether, these results favor a scenario in which the inner ~ 0.3-3 R_e of\nmassive quiescent galaxies have been passively evolving over the last half of\ncosmic time. Interestingly, the derived stellar ages are considerably younger\nthan the age of the universe at all epochs, consistent with an equivalent\nsingle-burst star formation epoch of z < 1.5.

Superbursts are attributed to the thermonuclear burning\nof carbon, and are approximately 1000 times more energetic than the regular\nshort Type I bursts. This allows us to study detailed spectra for over 11 ks,\ncompared to at most 100 s for regular bursts. A feature is present in the\nsuperburst spectra around 6.4 keV that is well fit with an emission line and an\nabsorption edge, suggestive of reflection of the superburst off the accretion\ndisk. The line and edge parameters evolve over time: the edge energy decreases\nfrom 9.4 keV at the peak to 8.1 keV in the tail, and both features become\nweaker in the tail. This is only the second superburst for which this has been\ndetected, and shows that this behavior is present even without strong radius\nexpansion. Furthermore, we find the persistent flux to almost double during the\nsuperburst, and return to the pre-superburst level in the tail.

In a first\napplication, the erosion of globular cluster systems (GCSs) in elliptical\ngalaxies is investigated.

An established method to measure the\nspin of black holes is via the study of relativistic reflection features from\nthe inner accretion disk. Owing to their greater distances, there has hitherto\nbeen no significant detection of relativistic reflection features in a\nmoderate-redshift quasar.

His fate has never been fully resolved and several articles\nhave been written that explore the mystery itself. His demise intrigues us\nstill today because of his seminal work, published the previous year, that\nestablished symmetric solutions to the Dirac equation that describe a fermionic\nparticle that is its own anti-particle. This work has long had a significant\nimpact in neutrino physics, where this fundamental question regarding the\nparticle remains unanswered. But the formalism he developed has found many uses\nas there are now a number of candidate spin-1/2 neutral particles that may be\ntruly neutral with no quantum number to distinguish them from their\nanti-particles. If such particles exist, they will influence many areas of\nnuclear and particle physics. Most notably the process of neutrinoless double\nbeta decay can only exist if neutrinos are massive Majorana particles. Hence,\nmany efforts to search for this process are underway. Majorana's influence\ndoesn't stop with particle physics, however, even though that was his original\nconsideration. The equations he derived also arise in solid state physics where\nthey describe electronic states in materials with superconducting order. Of\nspecial interest here is the class of solutions of the Majorana equation in one\nand two spatial dimensions at exactly zero energy. These Majorana zero modes\nare endowed with some remarkable physical properties that may lead to advances\nin quantum computing and, in fact, there is evidence that they have been\nexperimentally observed. This review first summarizes the basics of Majorana's\ntheory and its implications. It then provides an overview of the rich\nexperimental programs trying to find a fermion that is its own anti-particle in\nnuclear, particle, and solid state physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 20:54:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 21:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-12"}

We developed an automated method, GALtoICL,\nbased on the software GALAPAGOS to obtain a refined version of typical BCG+ICL\nmaps. We applied this method to our test case MACS J1206.2-0847, a massive\ncluster located at z=0.44, that is part of the CLASH sample. Using deep\nmulti-band SUBARU images, we extracted the surface brightness (SB) profile of\nthe BCG+ICL and we studied the ICL morphology, color, and contribution to f*\nout to R500. We repeated the same analysis using a different definition of the\nICL, SBlimit method, i.e. a SB cut-off level, to compare the results. The most\npeculiar feature of the ICL in MACS1206 is its asymmetric radial distribution,\nwith an excess in the SE direction and extending towards the 2nd brightest\ncluster galaxy which is a Post Starburst galaxy. This suggests an interaction\nbetween the BCG and this galaxy that dates back to t <= 1.5 Gyr. The BCG+ICL\nstellar content is 8% of M_(*,500) and the (de-) projected baryon fraction in\nstars is f*=0.0177 (0.0116), in excellent agreement with recent results. The\nSBlimit method provides systematically higher ICL fractions and this effect is\nlarger at lower SB limits. This is due to the light from the outer envelopes of\nmember galaxies that contaminate the ICL. Though more time consuming, the\nGALtoICL method provides safer ICL detections that are almost free of this\ncontamination. This is one of the few ICL study at redshift z > 0.3.

The sizes\nof the corresponding basins of attraction are found to depend strongly on the\nfull evolution of the dissipation. In order to predict the behaviour of the\nsystem, it is essential to understand how the sizes of the basins of attraction\nfor constant dissipation depend on the damping coefficient. For values of the\nparameters in the perturbation regime, we characterise analytically the\nconditions under which the attractors exist and study numerically how the sizes\nof their basins of attraction depend on the damping coefficient. Away from the\nperturbation regime, a numerical study of the attractors and the corresponding\nbasins of attraction for different constant values of the damping coefficient\nproduces a much more involved scenario: changing the magnitude of the\ndissipation causes some attractors to disappear either leaving no trace or\nproducing new attractors by bifurcation, such as period doubling and\nsaddle-node bifurcation. For an initially non-constant damping coefficient,\nboth increasing and decreasing to some finite final value, we numerically\nobserve that, when the damping coefficient varies slowly from a finite initial\nvalue to a different final value, without changing the set of attractors, the\nslower the variation the closer the sizes of the basins of attraction are to\nthose they have for constant damping coefficient fixed at the initial value. If\nduring the variation of the damping coefficient attractors appear or disappear,\nremarkable additional phenomena may occur. For instance, a fixed point\nasymptotically may attract the entire phase space, up to a zero measure set,\neven though no attractor with such a property exists for any value of the\ndamping coefficient between the extreme values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 22:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-29"}

Both tasks are\ngeneralizations of the two-party zero-error channel-coding problem, where a\nsender and a receiver want to perfectly communicate messages through a one-way\nclassical noisy channel. If the two parties are allowed to share entanglement,\nthere are several positive results that show the existence of channels for\nwhich they can communicate strictly more than what they could do with classical\nresources. In the first task, one sender wants to communicate a common message\nto multiple receivers. We show that if the number of receivers is greater than\na certain threshold then entanglement does not allow for an improvement in the\ncommunication for any finite number of uses of the channel. On the other hand,\nwhen the number of receivers is fixed, we exhibit a class of channels for which\nentanglement gives an advantage. The second problem we consider features\nmultiple collaborating senders and one receiver. Classically, cooperation among\nthe senders might allow them to communicate on average more messages than the\nsum of their individual possibilities. We show that whenever a channel allows\nsingle-sender entanglement-assisted advantage, then the gain extends also to\nthe multi-sender case.

This paper presents\nthe first set of solutions that can pick the best combination of coding rate\nand object chunking/slicing options as the load dynamically changes.

(2) We relate the delay optimal values for chunking level and\ncode rate to the queue backlogs via an approximate queueing analysis.

Our trace-driven simulation results show that\nTOFEC's adaptation mechanism converges to an appropriate code that provides the\noptimal throughput-delay trade-off without reducing system capacity. Compared\nto a non-adaptive strategy optimized for throughput, TOFEC delivers $2.5\\times$\nlower latency under light workloads; compared to a non-adaptive strategy\noptimized for latency, TOFEC can scale to support over $3\\times$ as many\nrequests.

Because the signal of such features can be\nquite small in deep solar layers and be buried in systematics or noise, the\ntrue meridional velocity profile has remained elusive. We perform time-distance\nhelioseismology measurements on several years worth of GONG Doppler data. A\nspherical harmonic decomposition technique is applied to a subset of acoustic\nmodes to measure travel-time differences to try to obtain signatures of\nmeridional flows throughout the solar convection zone.

State-of-the-art methods assume that the trait evolves according to a\ncontinuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) and work well for small state spaces. The\ncomputations slow down considerably for larger state spaces (e.g. space of\ncodons), because current methodology relies on exponentiating CTMC\ninfinitesimal rate matrices -- an operation whose computational complexity\ngrows as the size of the CTMC state space cubed. In this work, we introduce a\nnew approach, based on a CTMC technique called uniformization, that does not\nuse matrix exponentiation for phylogenetic stochastic mapping. Our method is\nbased on a new Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that targets the\ndistribution of trait histories conditional on the trait data observed at the\ntips of the tree. The computational complexity of our MCMC method grows as the\nsize of the CTMC state space squared. Moreover, in contrast to competing matrix\nexponentiation methods, if the rate matrix is sparse, we can leverage this\nsparsity and increase the computational efficiency of our algorithm further.\nUsing simulated data, we illustrate advantages of our MCMC algorithm and\ninvestigate how large the state space needs to be for our method to outperform\nmatrix exponentiation approaches. We show that even on the moderately large\nstate space of codons our MCMC method can be significantly faster than\ncurrently used matrix exponentiation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 05:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-21"}

A major challenge in\nnetwork virtualization is how to map multiple virtual networks onto specific\nnodes and links in the shared substrate network, known as virtual network\nembedding problem. Due to its NPhardness, many heuristic approaches have been\nproposed. In this thesis, we propose hybrid VN embedding algorithms that map\nmultiple VN requests with node and link constraints with K-core decomposition\nusing path splitting. Based on network pruning, a virtual network is decomposed\nto core network and edge network. The mapping process is divided into two\nphases: core network mapping and edge network mapping. Path splitting enables\nbetter resource utilization by allowing the substrate to accept more VN\nrequests. It splits the available bandwidth of the path into small bandwidth to\nsatisfy the resource constraints. The proposed algorithm improves the\nperformance of the algorithm by splitting the path into small bandwidth.

In the Gaussian many-to-one X channel,\ncommunication links exist between all transmitters and one of the receivers,\nalong with a communication link between each transmitter and its corresponding\nreceiver. As per the X channel assumption, transmission of messages is allowed\non all the links of the channel. This communication model is different from the\ncorresponding many-to-one interference channel (IC). Transmission strategies\nwhich involve using Gaussian codebooks and treating interference from a subset\nof transmitters as noise are formulated for the above channel. Sum-rate is used\nas the criterion of optimality for evaluating the strategies. Initially, a $3\n\\times 3$ many-to-one X channel is considered and three transmission strategies\nare analyzed. The first two strategies are shown to achieve sum-rate capacity\nunder certain channel conditions.

The ferroelectric\npolarization in DyMn2O5 is claimed to have two anti-parallel components: one\n(PDM) from the symmetric exchange striction between the Dy3+-Mn4+ interactions\nand the other (PMM) from the symmetric exchange striction between the Mn3+-Mn4+\ninteractions. We investigate the evolutions of the two components upon a\npartial substitution of Mn3+ by nonmagnetic Al3+ in order to tailor the Mn-Mn\ninteractions and then to modulate component PMM in DyMn2-x/2Alx/2O5.

The Dy3+-Mn4+ interactions and the polarization component PDM\ncan sustain against the substitution until a level as high as x=0.2.

Most existing methods attempt to explain each principal\ncomponent (PC) in terms of a small number of variables by generating\napproximate PCs with few non-zero loadings. Although useful when just a few\nvariables dominate the population PCs, these methods are often inadequate for\ncharacterizing the PCs of high-dimensional genomic data. For genomic data,\nreproducible and biologically meaningful PC interpretation requires methods\nbased on the combined signal of functionally related sets of genes. While gene\nset testing methods have been widely used in supervised settings to quantify\nthe association of groups of genes with clinical outcomes, these methods have\nseen only limited application for testing the enrichment of gene sets relative\nto sample PCs. Results: We describe a novel approach, principal component gene\nset enrichment (PCGSE), for computing the statistical association between gene\nsets and the PCs of genomic data. The PCGSE method performs a two-stage\ncompetitive gene set test using the correlation between each gene and each PC\nas the gene-level test statistic with flexible choice of both the gene set test\nstatistic and the method used to compute the null distribution of the gene set\nstatistic.

Here\nwe present a powerful new observational diagnostic to discriminate between\nprogenitor types and constrain the ambient medium density of SNRs solely using\nFe K-shell X-ray emission. We analyze all extant Suzaku observations of SNRs\nand detect Fe K alpha emission from 23 young or middle-aged remnants, including\nfive first detections (IC 443, G292.0+1.8, G337.2-0.7, N49, and N63A). The Fe K\nalpha centroids clearly separate progenitor types, with the Fe-rich ejecta in\nType Ia remnants being significantly less ionized than in core-collapse SNRs.\nWithin each progenitor group, the Fe K alpha luminosity and centroid are well\ncorrelated, with more luminous objects having more highly ionized Fe. Our\nresults indicate that there is a strong connection between explosion type and\nambient medium density, and suggest that Type Ia supernova progenitors do not\nsubstantially modify their surroundings at radii of up to several parsecs. We\nalso detect a K-shell radiative recombination continuum of Fe in W49B and IC\n443, implying a strong circumstellar interaction in the early evolutionary\nphases of these core-collapse remnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 14:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

This lack of any characteristic scale and such\nelaborated behaviours find their origin in the theory of complex systems. There\nare several mechanisms which generate scale invariance but maximum entropy\nmodels are able to explain both scale invariance and collective behaviours. The\nstudy of the structure and collective modes of financial markets attracts more\nand more attention. It has been shown that some agent based models are able to\nreproduce some stylized facts. Despite their partial success, there is still\nthe problem of rules design. In this work, we used a statistical inverse\napproach to model the structure and co-movements in financial markets. Inverse\nmodels restrict the number of assumptions. We found that a pairwise maximum\nentropy model is consistent with the data and is able to describe the complex\nstructure of financial systems. We considered the existence of a critical state\nwhich is linked to how the market processes information, how it responds to\nexogenous inputs and how its structure changes. The considered data sets did\nnot reveal a persistent critical state but rather oscillations between order\nand disorder. In this framework, we also showed that the collective modes are\nmostly dominated by pairwise co-movements and that univariate models are not\ngood candidates to model crashes. The analysis also suggests a genuine adaptive\nprocess since both the maximum variance of the log-likelihood and the accuracy\nof the predictive scheme vary through time. This approach may provide some clue\nto crash precursors and may provide highlights on how a shock spreads in a\nfinancial network and if it will lead to a crash.

Numerical examples are provided.Moreover, the fact that\nunder such hypotheses, Gr{\\\"o}bner bases can be computed stably has many\napplications. Firstly, the mapping sending $(f\\_1,\\dots,f\\_s)$ to the reduced\nGr{\\\"o}bner basis of the ideal they span is differentiable, and its\ndifferential can be given explicitly. Secondly, these hypotheses allows to\nperform lifting on the Grobner bases, from $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k \\mathbb{Z}$ to\n$\\mathbb{Z}/p^{k+k'} \\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}.$ Finally, asking for the same\nhypotheses on the highest-degree homogeneous components of the entry\npolynomials allows to extend our strategy to the affine case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 12:37:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2015 17:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-28"}

Recall that the codomain of a\n$(\\sigma,\\varepsilon)$-quadratic form is the group $\\overline{K} :=\nK/K_{\\sigma,\\varepsilon}$, where $K$ is the underlying division ring of the\nvector space on which the form is defined and $K_{\\sigma,\\varepsilon} :=\n\\{t-t^\\sigma\\varepsilon\\}_{t\\in K}$. Generalized pseudo-quadratic forms are\ndefined in the same way as $(\\sigma,\\varepsilon)$-quadratic forms but for\nreplacing $\\overline{K}$ with a quotient $\\overline{K}/\\overline{R}$ for a\nsubgroup $\\overline{R}$ of $\\overline{K}$ such that\n$\\lambda^\\sigma\\overline{R}\\lambda = \\overline{R}$ for any $\\lambda\\in K$. In\nparticular, every non-trivial generalized pseudo-quadratic form admits a unique\nsesquilinearization, characterized by the same property as the\nsesquilinearization of a pseudo-quadratic form.

By exploiting this theorem we also obtain an\nelementary proof of the following well known fact: an embedding $e$ as above is\ndominant if and only if either $e(S) = S_q$ for a pseudo-quadratic form $q$ or\n$\\mathrm{char}(K)\\neq 2$ and $e(S) = S_f$ for an alternating form $f$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 09:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-25"}

In 1980 there was no known\nimpact structure, which could be responsible for this extinction. It was not\nuntil 1991 that an international group of researchers proposed that a circular\nstructure between 180 and 200 km, buried under Tertiary deposits in the Yucatan\nPeninsula in Mexico, was the crater formed by the impact proposed by the group\nof Alvarez (Hildebrand et al., 1991). It is very probable that an impact of\nthis magnitude have had large effects on the surface and in the environment. To\nstudy these effects, it is necessary to estimate the characteristics that the\nimpactor had. The literature often mentions the nature of the impactor, and has\nbeen proposed both an asteroid and a comet, and even a comet shower that\nproduced periodic extinctions. However, the physical parameters of the impactor\nare not limited, so the aim of this study is to estimate the most relevant\nfeatures of this one such as the size, mass and kinetic energy. We found that\nthe kinetic energy of the impactor is in the range from 1.3e24 J to 5.8e25 J.\nThe mass is in the range of 1.0e15 kg to 4.6e17 kg. Finally, the diameter of\nthe object is in the range of 10.6 km to 80.9 km. Based on the mass of the\nimpactor and iridium abundance in different types of meteorites, we calculate\nthe concentration of iridium, which should be observed in the K/Pg layer. When\ncompared with the measurements, we concluded that the best estimation is that\nthe impactor was a comet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 19:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-26"}

In this paper we investigate what affects the level of participation\nof users in the political discussion. Specifically, are users more likely to be\nactive when they are surrounded by like-minded individuals, or, alternatively,\nwhen their environment is heterogeneous, and so their messages might be carried\nto people with differing views. To answer this question, we analyzed the\nactivity of about 200K Twitter users who expressed explicit support for one of\nthe candidates of the 2012 US presidential election. We quantified the level of\npolitical activity (PA) of users by the fraction of political tweets in their\nposts, and analyzed the relationship between PA and measures of the users'\npolitical environment. These measures were designed to assess the\nlikemindedness, e.g., the fraction of users with similar political views, of\ntheir virtual and geographic environments. Our results showed that high PA is\nusually obtained by users in politically balanced virtual environment. This is\nin line with the disagreement theory of political science that states that a\nuser's PA is invigorated by the disagreement with their peers. Our results also\nshow that users surrounded by politically like-minded virtual peers tend to\nhave low PA. This observation contradicts the echo chamber amplification theory\nthat states that a person tends to be more politically active when surrounded\nby like-minded people. Finally, we observe that the likemindedness of the\ngeographical environment does not affect PA. We thus conclude that PA of users\nis independent of the likemindedness of their geographical environment and is\ncorrelated with likemindedness of their virtual environment. The exact form of\ncorrelation manifests the phenomenon of disagreement and, in a majority of\nsettings, contradicts the echo chamber amplification theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Mar 2014 16:08:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 2014 14:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-18"}
