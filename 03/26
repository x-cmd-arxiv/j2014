During its evolution into the dual-synchronous\nstate, the equilibrium tidal figures of Pluto and Charon would have also\nevolved as angular momentum was transferred from Pluto's spin to Charon's\norbit. The rate of tidal evolution is controlled by Pluto's interior physical\nand thermal state. We examine three interior models for Pluto: an\nundifferentiated rock/ice mixture, differentiated with ice above rock, and\ndifferentiated with an ocean. For the undifferentiated case without an ocean,\nthe Pluto-Charon binary does not evolve to its current state unless its\ninternal temperature $T_i>200$ K, which would likely lead to strong tidal\nheating, melting, and differentiation. Without an ocean, Pluto's interior\ntemperature must be higher than 240 K for Charon to evolve on a time scale less\nthan the age of the solar system. Further tidal heating would likely create an\nocean. If New Horizons finds evidence of ancient tidally-driven tectonic\nactivity on either body, the most likely explanation is that Pluto had an\ninternal ocean during Charon's orbital evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 19:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

We then produce maps of Hi, CO-free molecular gas, and CO, and\ninvestigate the following aspects: i) The spatial distribution of the warm,\ncold, and molecular gas, finding the well-known layered structure, with\nmolecular gas surrounded by cold Hi, surrounded by warm Hi. ii) The velocity of\nthe various components, with atomic gas generally flowing towards the molecular\ngas, and that this motion is reflected in the frequently observed bimodal shape\nof the Hi profiles. This conclusion is tentative, because we do not include\nfeedback. iii) The production of Hi self-absorption (HISA) profiles, and the\ncorrelation of HISA with molecular gas. We test the suggestion of using the\nsecond derivative of the brightness temperature Hi profile to trace HISA and\nmolecular gas, finding limitations. On a scale of ~parsecs, some agreement is\nobtained between this technique and actual HISA, as well as a correlation\nbetween HISA and N(mol). It quickly deteriorates towards sub-parsec scales. iv)\nThe N-PDFs of the actual Hi gas and those recovered from the Hi line profiles,\nwith the latter having a cutoff at column densities where the gas becomes\noptically thick, thus missing the contribution from the HISA-producing gas. We\nfind that the power-law tail typical of gravitational contraction is only\nobserved in the molecular gas, and that, before the power-law tail develops in\nthe total gas density PDF, no CO is yet present, reinforcing the notion that\ngravitational contraction is needed to produce this component.

Of course, vibrational\ndynamics in liquids and crystals are quite different and it is not expected\nthat the results obtained on a model crystal should be valid for liquids.\nHowever, these considerations provide a benchmark to which the results of the\nprevious molecular dynamics simulations can be compared. Thus, assuming that\nvibrations are plane waves, we derive analytical expressions for the atomic\nlevel stress correlation functions in the classical limit and analyze them.\nThese results provide, in particular, a recipe for analysis of the atomic level\nstress correlation functions in Fourier space and extraction of the wavevector\nand frequency dependent information. We also evaluate the energies of the\natomic level stresses. Obtained energies are significantly smaller than the\nenergies that were obtained in MD simulations of liquids previously. This\nresult suggests that the average energies of the atomic level stresses in\nliquids and glasses are largely determined by the structural disorder. We\ndiscuss this result in the context of equipartition of the atomic level stress\nenergies. Analysis of the previously published data suggests that it is\npossible to speak about configurational and vibrational contributions to the\naverage energies of the atomic level stresses in a glass state. However, this\nseparation in a liquid state is problematic. We also consider peak broadening\nin the pair distribution function with increase of distance.

The first\none is related to the Higgs and Z resonances and the LSP is mostly Bino. The\nsecond one is achieved for a mass larger than 90 GeV and the LSP behaves as the\nwell-tempered neutralino. An advantage of the triplet contribution is that the\nwell-tempered neutralino can be a Bino-Triplino mixture, relieving the problem\nof achieving M_2 ~ M_1 in unified scenarios. The dark matter constraints\nstrongly affect the Higgs phenomenology, reducing the potential enhancements of\nthe diphoton and of the Z + photon channels by 20% at most. These enhancements\nare however larger than the MSSM ones. In the near future, complementarity of\ndark matter direct searches and collider experiments will be crucial to probe\nmost of the parameter space where the neutralino is the dark matter candidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 17:52:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Aug 2014 11:55:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We show that\nit is relevant to consider a spectral optimal design problem corresponding to\nan average of the classical observability inequality over random initial data,\nwhere the unknown ranges over the set of all possible measurable subsets of\n$\\Omega$ of fixed measure. We prove that, under appropriate sufficient spectral\nassumptions, this optimal design problem has a unique solution, depending only\non a finite number of modes, and that the optimal domain is semi-analytic and\nthus has a finite number of connected components.

As Albert Einstein\nwas once quoted to say: 'Everything must be made as simple as possible, but not\none bit simpler'. The simplicity of an idea brings versatility of that idea\ninto a broader domain, while its complexity describes the foundation upon which\nthe idea stands. One of the well-known and powerful examples of such balance is\nin the Boolean algebra and its impact on the birth of digital electronics and\ndigital information age. The simplicity of using only two numbers of '0' and\n'1' in describing an arbitrary quantity made the fields of digital electronics\nand digital signal processing powerful and ubiquitous. Here, inspired by the\nsimplicity of digital electrical systems we propose to apply an analogous idea\nto the field of metamaterials, namely, to develop the notion of digital\nmetamaterials. Specifically, we investigate how one can synthesize an\nelectromagnetic metamaterial with desired materials parameters, e.g., with a\ndesired permittivity, using only two elemental materials, which we call\n'metamaterial bits' with two distinct permittivity functions, as building\nblocks. We demonstrate, analytically and numerically, how proper spatial\nmixtures of such metamaterial bits leads to 'metamaterial bytes' with material\nparameters different from the parameters of metamaterial bits. We also explore\nthe role of relative spatial orders of such digital materials bits in\nconstructing different parameters for the digital material bytes. We then apply\nthis methodology to several design examples such as flat graded-index digital\nlens, cylindrical scatterers, digital constructs for epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)\nsupercoupling, and digital hyperlens, highlighting the power and simplicity of\nthis methodology and algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 20:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In this work, time-resolved pump-probe x-ray\nphoto-emission electron microscopy is used to observe magnetic signal\ntransmission along a chain of nanomagnets. We resolve successive error-free\nswitching events in a single nanomagnet chain at speeds on the order of 100 ps\nper nanomagnet, consistent with predictions based on micromagnetic modeling.\nErrors which disrupt transmission are also observed.

While the symmetry\nfractionalization must be consistent with the fusion and braiding rules of the\nanyons, not all ostensibly consistent symmetry fractionalizations can be\nrealized in 2D systems. Instead, certain `anomalous' SETs can only occur on the\nsurface of a 3D symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase. In this paper we\ndescribe a procedure for determining whether an SET of a discrete, onsite,\nunitary symmetry group $G$ is anomalous or not. The basic idea is to gauge the\nsymmetry and expose the anomaly as an obstruction to a consistent topological\ntheory combining both the original anyons and the gauge fluxes. Utilizing a\nresult of Etingof, Nikshych, and Ostrik, we point out that a class of\nobstructions are captured by the fourth cohomology group $H^4( G, \\,U(1))$,\nwhich also precisely labels the set of 3D SPT phases, with symmetry group $G$.\nWe thus establish a general bulk-boundary correspondence between the anomalous\nSET and the 3d bulk SPT whose surface termination realizes it. We illustrate\nthis idea using the chiral spin liquid ($U(1)_2$) topological order with a\nreduced symmetry $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\subset SO(3)$, which can\nact on the semion quasiparticle in an anomalous way. We construct exactly\nsolved 3d SPT models realizing the anomalous surface terminations, and\ndemonstrate that they are non-trivial by computing three loop braiding\nstatistics. Possible extensions to anti-unitary symmetries are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 20:22:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2015 14:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

The method of\nperturbed angular correlation of gamma rays (PAC) has been applied over the\npast decade to study impurity diffusion through measurement of nuclear\nquadrupole interactions (NQI) at nuclei of 111In/Cd probe atoms. Extensive\nmeasurements have been made on highly-ordered compounds having the L12 crystal\nstructure, including In3R, Sn3R, Ga3R, Al3R and Pd3R phases (R= rare-earth\nelement). Measurements in thermal equilibrium at high temperature served to\ndetermine lattice locations of 111In parent probe-atoms, through characteristic\nNQIs, and to measure diffusional jump-frequencies of 111Cd daughter\nprobe-atoms, through relaxation of the NQI. This paper summarizes results of\nthe jump-frequency measurements and relates them to the conventional\ndiffusivity. ... A change in diffusion mechanism was proposed in 2009 to\nexplain jump-frequency systematics for In3R phases. An alternative explanation\nis proposed in the present paper based on site-preferences of 111Cd daughter\nprobes newly observed along the parallel Pd3R series. The diffusivity can be\nexpressed as the product of a jump-frequency such as measured in these studies\nand a correlation factor for diffusion that depends on the diffusion mechanism.\nThe correlation factor can be modeled for the L12 structure and diffusion\nsublattice of interest using a five-frequency model originally proposed for\nmetals. Although the correlation factor is an essential parameter for the\ndiffusion of impurities, it has never been measured. It is suggested that\nvalues of the correlation factor can be determined feasibly by combining\nresults of jump-frequency measurements such as the present ones with\ndiffusivity measurements made for the same host-impurity systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Mar 2014 21:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-27"}

(2) When do physics majors\ndevelop expert-like beliefs? and (3) How do students' beliefs impact their\nlearning of physics? We report that in typical physics classes, students'\nbeliefs deteriorate or at best stay the same. There are a few types of\ninterventions, including an explicit focus on model-building and/or developing\nexpert- like beliefs that lead to significant improvements in beliefs. Further,\nsmall courses and those for elementary education and non-science majors also\nresult in improved beliefs. However, because the available data oversamples\ncertain types of classes, it is unclear whether these improvements are actually\ndue to the interventions, or due to the small class size, or student population\ntypical of the kinds of classes in which these interventions are most often\nused. Physics majors tend to enter their undergraduate education with more\nexpert-like beliefs than non-majors and these beliefs remain relatively stable\nthroughout their undergraduate careers. Thus, typical physics courses appear to\nbe selecting students who already have strong beliefs, rather than supporting\nstudents in developing strong beliefs. There is a small correlation between\nstudents' incoming beliefs about physics and their gains on conceptual\nmechanics surveys. This suggests that students with more expert-like incoming\nbeliefs may learn more in their physics courses, but this finding should be\nfurther explored and replicated.

Most prior theoretical results in compressed sensing and\nrelated inverse problems apply to idealized settings where the noise is i.i.d.,\nand do not account for signal-dependent noise and physical sensing constraints.\nPrior results on Poisson compressed sensing with signal-dependent noise and\nphysical constraints provided upper bounds on mean squared error performance\nfor a specific class of estimators.

This work provides minimax lower bounds on mean-squared error for\nsparse Poisson inverse problems under physical constraints. Our lower bounds\nare complemented by minimax upper bounds. Our upper and lower bounds reveal\nthat due to the interplay between the Poisson noise model, the sparsity\nconstraint and the physical constraints: (i) the mean-squared error does not\ndepend on the sample size $n$ other than to ensure the sensing matrix satisfies\nRIP-like conditions and the intensity $T$ of the input signal plays a critical\nrole; and (ii) the mean-squared error has two distinct regimes, a low-intensity\nand a high-intensity regime and the transition point from the low-intensity to\nhigh-intensity regime depends on the input signal $f^*$.

Recent\nwork has considered addressing his challenge by using coherently controlled\nadiabatic evolutions in the place of classically controlled evolution. An\nimportant question remains: what is the relative power of controlled adiabatic\nevolution to traditional adiabatic evolutions? We address this by showing that\ncoherent control and measurement provides a way to average different adiabatic\nevolutions in ways that cause their diabatic errors to cancel, allowing for\nadiabatic evolutions to combine the best characteristics of existing adiabatic\noptimizations strategies that are mutually exclusive in conventional adiabatic\nQIP. This result shows that coherent control and measurement can provide\nadvantages for adiabatic state preparation. We also provide upper bounds on the\ncomplexity of simulating such evolutions on a circuit based quantum computer\nand provide sufficiency conditions for the equivalence of controlled adiabatic\nevolutions to adiabatic quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 00:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Particular attention are given to functions with random Gaussian\nor Gamma parameters. We first demonstrate that the traditional Hermite\n(Laguerre) polynomials chaos expansion suffers from the \\textit{instability} in\nthe sense that an \\textit{unfeasible} number of points, which is relevant to\nthe dimension of the approximation space, is needed to guarantee the stability\nin the least square framework. We then propose to use the Hermite/Laguerre {\\em\nfunctions} (rather than polynomials) as bases in the expansion. The\ncorresponding design points are obtained by mapping the uniformly distributed\nrandom points in bounded intervals to the unbounded domain, which involved a\nmapping parameter $L$. By using the Hermite/Laguerre {\\em functions} and a\nproper mapping parameter, the stability can be significantly improved even if\nthe number of design points scales \\textit{linearly} (up to a logarithmic\nfactor) with the dimension of the approximation space. Apart from the\nstability, another important issue is the rate of convergence. To speed up the\nconvergence, an effective scaling factor is introduced, and a principle for\nchoosing quasi-optimal scaling factor is discussed.

The key feature of the approach is that the conductivity\nafter the change is parameterized as a linear combination of the initial state\nand the change. This allows for modeling independently the spatial\ncharacteristics of the background conductivity and the change of the\nconductivity - by separate regularization functionals. The approach also allows\nin a straightforward way the restriction of the conductivity change to a\nlocalized region of interest inside the domain.

Its noise and sensitivity performance were\nexcellent, but the rate of cosmic ray impacts on the HFI detectors was\nunexpectedly high. Furthermore, collisions of cosmic rays with the focal plane\nproduced transient signals in the data (glitches) with a wide range of\ncharacteristics. A study of cosmic ray impacts on the HFI detector modules has\nbeen undertaken to categorize and characterize the glitches, to correct the HFI\ntime-ordered data, and understand the residual effects on Planck maps and data\nproducts. This paper presents an evaluation of the physical origins of glitches\nobserved by the HFI detectors. In order to better understand the glitches\nobserved by HFI in flight, several ground-based experiments were conducted with\nflight-spare HFI bolometer modules. The experiments were conducted between 2010\nand 2013 with HFI test bolometers in different configurations using varying\nparticles and impact energies. The bolometer modules were exposed to 23 MeV\nprotons from the Orsay IPN TANDEM accelerator, and to $^{241}$Am and $^{244}$Cm\n$\\alpha$-particle and $^{55}$Fe radioactive X-ray sources. The calibration data\nfrom the HFI ground-based preflight tests were used to further characterize the\nglitches and compare glitch rates with statistical expectations under\nlaboratory conditions. Test results provide strong evidence that the dominant\nfamily of glitches observed in flight are due to cosmic ray absorption by the\nsilicon die substrate on which the HFI detectors reside. Glitch energy is\npropagated to the thermistor by ballistic phonons, while there is also a\nthermal diffusion contribution. The implications of these results for future\nsatellite missions, especially those in the far-infrared to sub-millimetre and\nmillimetre regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 09:01:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 10:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

The presence of an infrared excess at >3-5 microns over the\nexpectation of a theoretical steady state accretion disk is ubiquitous in our\nsample. The strength of the infrared excess is not correlated with orbital\nperiod, but shows a statistically significant correlation (but shallow trend)\nwith system inclination that might be partially (but not completely) linked to\nthe increasing view of the cooler outer accretion disk and disk rim at higher\ninclinations. We discuss the possible origin of the infrared excess in terms of\nemission from bremsstrahlung or circumbinary dust, with either mechanism\nfacilitated by the mass outflows (e.g., disk wind/corona, accretion stream\noverflow, and so on) present in novalikes. Our comparison of the relative\nadvantages and disadvantages of either mechanism for explaining the\nobservations suggests that the situation is rather ambiguous, largely\ncircumstantial, and in need of stricter observational constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 09:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

It is believed that a hydromagnetic dynamo is responsible for\nproducing this large-scale field, although this dynamo process is not well\nunderstood.\n  Within the framework of mean-field dynamo theory, our aim is to investigate\nhow competing mechanisms for poloidal field regeneration (namely a time delayed\nBabcock-Leighton surface alpha-effect and an interface-type alpha-effect), can\nlead to the modulation of magnetic activity in a deep-seated solar dynamo\nmodel.\n  We solve the standard alpha-omega dynamo equations in one spatial dimension,\nincluding source terms corresponding to both of the the competing alpha-effects\nin the evolution equation for the poloidal field. This system is solved using\ntwo different methods. In addition to solving the one-dimensional partial\ndifferential equations directly, using numerical techniques, we also use a\nlocal approximation to reduce the governing equations to a set of coupled\nordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are studied using a combination\nof analytical and numerical methods.\n  In the ODE model, it is straightforward to find parameters such that a series\nof bifurcations can be identified as the time delay is increased, with the\ndynamo transitioning from periodic states to chaotic states via multiply\nperiodic solutions. Similar transitions can be observed in the full model, with\nthe chaotically modulated solutions exhibiting solar-like behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 09:46:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

This is the first large-scale\nevaluation of any symmetry detection technique that we are aware of.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 11:53:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Oct 2014 17:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

From a mobile observatory at the\nFrauenberg near Marburg (Hesse) he measured the astronomical longitude\ndifference between C.F. Gau{\\ss}'s observatory at G\\\"ottingen and F.G.B.\nNicolai's observatory at Mannheim within an error of 0.4\". To achieve this\nprecision he first used a series of light signals for synchronizing the\nobservatory clocks and, second, he very carefully corrected for the varying\nreaction time of the observers. By comparing these astronomical results with\nthe geodetic--determined longitude differences he had recently measured for the\ntriangulation of Kurhessen, he was able to extract a combined value of the\ndeflection of the vertical in longitude of G\\\"ottingen and Mannheim. His\nresults closely agree with modern vertical deflection data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 11:54:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-27"}

The IPN satellites provide accurate times of the bursts\nand sky localizations that vary significantly from degree scale to hundreds of\nsquare degrees. We search for both a well-modeled binary coalescence signal,\nthe favored progenitor model for short GRBs, and for generic, unmodeled\ngravitational wave bursts. Both searches use the event time and sky\nlocalization to improve the gravitational-wave search sensitivity as compared\nto corresponding all-time, all-sky searches. We find no evidence of a\ngravitational-wave signal associated with any of the IPN GRBs in the sample,\nnor do we find evidence for a population of weak gravitational-wave signals\nassociated with the GRBs. For all IPN-detected GRBs, for which a sufficient\nduration of quality gravitational-wave data is available, we place lower bounds\non the distance to the source in accordance with an optimistic assumption of\ngravitational-wave emission energy of $10^{-2}M_{\\odot}c^2$ at 150 Hz, and find\na median of 13 Mpc. For the 27 short-hard GRBs we place 90% confidence\nexclusion distances to two source models: a binary neutron star coalescence,\nwith a median distance of 12Mpc, or the coalescence of a neutron star and black\nhole, with a median distance of 22 Mpc. Finally, we combine this search with\npreviously published results to provide a population statement for GRB searches\nin first-generation LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors, and a\nresulting examination of prospects for the advanced gravitational-wave\ndetectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 11:54:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 14:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-09"}

Our work does\nnot provide high-level network abstractions (address pools, VPN maps, etc.),\ninstead it focuses on providing a clean low level interface that supports the\ndevelopment of these higher layer abstractions. The goal of tinyNBI is to allow\nconfiguration of all existing OpenFlow abstractions without having to deal with\nthe unique personalities of each version of OpenFlow or their level of support\nin target switches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 12:15:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-27"}

To increase the detection rate of jets in LLAGN, we analyze\nsubarcsecond resolution data of three low-ionization nuclear emission regions.\nThis yields the detection of extended jet-like radio structures in NGC\\,1097\nand NGC\\,2911 and the first resolved parsec-scale jet of NGC\\,4594 (Sombrero).\nThe three sources belong to a sample of nearby LLAGN for which\nhigh-spatial-resolution spectral energy distribution of their core emission is\navailable.

Rev. B 84, 201308(R) (2011), an isolated Majorana\nstate bound to one edge of a long enough Kitaev chain in the topological phase\nand connected to a quantum dot, results in a robust transmittance of $1/2$ at\nzero-bias. In this work, we show that the removal of such a hallmark can be\nachieved by using a metallic surface hosting two adatoms in a scenario where\nthere is a lack of symmetry in the Fano effect, which is feasible by coupling\nthe Kitaev chain to one of these adatoms. Thus in order to detect this feature\nexperimentally, one should apply the following two-stage procedure: (i) first,\nattached to the adatoms, one has to lock AFM tips in opposite gate voltages\n(symmetric detuning of the levels) and measure by an STM tip, the zero-bias\nconductance; (ii) thereafter, the measurement of the conductance is repeated\nwith the gates swapped. For the absolute value of the detuning away from the\nFermi energy and in the case of strong coupling tip-host, this approach reveals\nin the transmittance, a persistent dip placed at zero-bias and immune to the\naforementioned permutation, but characterized by an amplitude that fluctuates\nslightly around $1/2$. However, in the case of a tip acting as a probe, the\nadatom decoupled from the Kitaev chain becomes completely inert and no\nfluctuation is observed. Therefore, the STM tip must be considered in the same\nfooting as the \"host+adatoms\" system. As a result, we have found that despite\nthe small difference between these two Majorana dips, the zero-bias\ntransmittance as a function of the symmetric detuning yields two distinct\nbehaviors, in which one of them is unpredictable by the standard Fano's theory.\nTherefore, to access such a non trivial pattern of Fano interference, the\nhypothesis of the STM tip acting as a probe should be discarded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 14:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-27"}

We\nfind a linear amplification of epicyclic oscillations in these disks that\ndepends on the effective cooling time, i.e. an overstability. The growth rates\nof the overstability vanish for both extreme cases, e.g. infinite cooling time\nand instantaneous cooling, i.e. the adiabatic and fully isothermal cases.\nHowever, for thermal relaxation times $\\tau$ on the order of the orbital\nfrequency, $\\tau\\Omega \\sim 1$, modes grow at a rate proportional to the square\nof the Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency. The overstability is based on epicyclic\nmotions, with the thermal relaxation causing gas to heat while radially\ndisplaced inwards, and cool while radially displaced outwards. This causes the\ngas to have a lower density when moving outwards compared to when it moves\ninwards, so it feels the outwards directed pressure force more strongly on that\nleg of the journey. We suggest the term ``Convective Overstability\" for the\nphenomenon that has already been numerically studied in the non-linear regime\nin the context of amplifying vortices in disks, under the name ``Subcritical\nBaroclinic Instability\". The point of the present paper is to make clear that\nvortex formation in three-dimensional disks is neither subcritical, i.e. does\nnot need a finite perturbation, nor is it baroclinic in the sense of\ngeophysical fluid dynamics, which requires on vertical shear. We find that\nConvective Overstability is a linear instability that will operate under a wide\nrange of physical conditions for circumstellar disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 15:50:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Apr 2014 09:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

S. Skardal, A. Karma, and J. G. Restrepo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 108103\n(2012)] and ionic model simulations. We find that, close to the alternans\nbifurcation, SDA is manifested as a smooth wavy modulation of the amplitudes of\nboth repolarization and calcium transient (CaT) alternans, similarly to the\nwell-studied case of voltage-driven alternans. In contrast, further away from\nthe bifurcation, the amplitude of CaT alternans jumps discontinuously at the\nnodes separating out-of-phase regions, while the amplitude of repolarization\nalternans remains smooth. We show that node motion of discontinuous SDA\npatterns is strongly hysteretic even in homogeneous tissue due to the novel\nphenomenon of \"unidirectional pinning\": node movement can only be induced\ntowards, but not away from, the pacing site in response to a change of pacing\nrate or physiological parameter. In addition, we show that the wavelength of\ndiscontinuous SDA patterns scales linearly with the conduction velocity\nrestitution length scale, in contrast to the wavelength of smooth patterns that\nscales sub-linearly with this length scale. Those results are also shown to be\nrobust against cell-to-cell fluctuations owing to the property that\nunidirectional node motion collapses multiple jumps accumulating in nodal\nregions into a single jump. Amplitude equation predictions are in good overall\nagreement with ionic model simulations. Finally, we briefly discuss\nphysiological implications of our findings. In particular, we suggest that due\nto the tendency of conduction blocks to form near nodes, the presence of\nunidirectional pinning makes calcium-driven alternans potentially more\narrhythmogenic than voltage-driven alternans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 15:59:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Apr 2014 08:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-08-22"}

To answer this question, we\nmust consider whether the value of objects is inherent, is a product of social\ninteraction, or involves other mechanisms. Economic theory predicts that there\nis an optimal price for any market transaction, and can be observed during\nauctions or other bidding processes. However, there are also social, cultural,\nand cognitive components to the assignation of value, which can be observed in\nboth human and non-human Primate societies. While behaviors related to these\nfactors are embedded in market interactions, they also involve a biological\nsubstrate for the assignation of value (valuation). To synthesize this\ndiversity of perspectives, we will propose that the process of valuation can be\nmodeled computationally and conceived of as a set of interrelated cultural\nevolutionary, cognitive, and neural processes. To do this, contextual geometric\nstructures (CGS) will be placed in an agent-based context (minimal and\ncompositional markets). Objects in the form of computational propositions can\nbe acquired and exchanged, which will determine the value of both singletons\nand linked propositions.

In each case, we evaluate the number of e-folds, scalar as\nwell as tensor power spectra, scalar spectral index and important observational\nparameter, i.e., tensor-scalar ratio in terms of inflatons. The graphical\nbehavior of this parameter shows that the model remains incompatible with WMAP7\nand Planck observational data in each case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 11:04:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jun 2014 05:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-03"}
