We model the pericentre passage of a dust-enshrouded star during which\nthe dusty envelope becomes stretched by tidal forces and is affected by the\ninteraction with the surrounding medium. In particular, we explore under which\nconditions these encounters can lead to periods of enhanced accretion activity.\nWe discuss different scenarios for such a dusty source. To this end, we\nemployed a modification of the Swift integration package. Elements of the cloud\nwere modelled as numerical particles that represent the dust component that\ninteracts with the optically thin gaseous environment. We determine the\nfraction of the total mass of the dust component that is diverted from the\noriginal path during the passages through the pericentre at $\\sim 10^3$\nSchwarzschild radii and find that the main part of the dust ($\\gtrsim 90\\%$ of\nits mass) is significantly affected upon the first crossing.

Encounter of a core-less cloud with a\nsupermassive black hole is, most likely, a non-repeating event: the cloud is\ndestroyed.

Infrared excesses\nat 24 micron were also found to derive from the immediate vicinity of younger,\nhot WDs, most of which are still central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN). The\nincidence of CSPN with this excess is 18%. The Helix CSPN, with a 24 micron\nexcess, has been suggested to have a disk formed from collisions of Kuiper\nbelt-like objects (KBOs). In this paper, we have analyzed an additional sample\nof CSPN to look for similar infrared excesses. These CSPN are all members of\nthe PG 1159 class and were chosen because their immediate progenitors are known\nto often have dusty environments consistent with large dusty disks. We find\nthat, overall, PG 1159 stars do not present such disks more often than other\nCSPN, although the statistics (5 objects) are poor. We then consider the entire\nsample of CSPN with infrared excesses, and compare it to the infrared\nproperties of old WDs, as well as cooler post-AGB stars. We conclude with the\nsuggestion that the infrared properties of CSPN more plausibly derive from\nAGB-formed disks rather than disks formed via the collision of KBOs, although\nthe latter scenario cannot be ruled out. We finally remark that there seems to\nbe an association between CSPN with a 24 micron excess and confirmed or\npossible binarity of the central star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Mar 2014 20:24:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We find weak spatial correlations between\nthe remnant's emission features on large scales, but several cases of good\noptical/X-ray correlations on small scales for features which have brightened\ndue to recent interaction with the reverse shock.

To explain this behavior, we propose a\ninhomogeneous model for Cas A's ejecta consisting of small, dense optically\nemitting knots (n ~ 10^(2-3)/cm^(3)) and a much lower density (n ~ 0.1 -\n1/cm^(3)) diffuse X-ray emitting component often spatially associated with\noptical emission knots. The X-ray emitting component is sometimes linked to\noptical clumps through shock induced mass ablation generating trailing material\nleading to spatially offset X-ray/optical emissions. A range of ejecta\ndensities can also explain the observed X-ray/optical time delays since the\nremnant's 5000 km/s reverse shock heats dense ejecta clumps to temperatures\naround 3x10^4 K relatively quickly which then become optically bright while\nmore diffuse ejecta become X-ray bright on longer timescales.

These assumptions are needed due to the scarcity of\nobservational constraints on the relevant physical processes which occur when\nthe SMBH is being fed via mass accretion in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). In\nsearch for these constraints, our group -- AGN Integral Field Spectroscopy\n(AGNIFS) -- has been mapping the gas kinematics as well as the stellar\npopulation properties of the inner few hundred parsecs of a sample of nearby\nAGN hosts. In this contribution, I report results obtained so far which show\ngas inflows along nuclear spirals and compact disks in the inner tens to\nhundreds of pc in nearby AGN hosts which seem to be the sources of fuel to the\nAGN.

Due to the\nprojection of transiting exomoon orbits onto the celestial plane, satellites\nappear more often at larger separations from their planet. After about a dozen\nrandomly sampled observations, a photometric orbital sampling effect (OSE)\nstarts to appear in the phase-folded transit light curve, indicative of the\nmoons' radii and planetary distances. Two additional outcomes of the OSE emerge\nin the planet's transit timing variations (TTV-OSE) and transit duration\nvariations (TDV-OSE), both of which permit measurements of a moon's mass.

E \\textbf{76}, 015102 (2007)]; however, this was limited\nto the case whereby the network was assumed to have only two communities, and\nit is evident that the modularity should be calculated in general with $q(\\geq\n2)$ communities. Here, we calculate the modularity for $q$ communities by\nevaluating the ground state energy of the $q$-state Potts Hamiltonian, based on\nreplica symmetric solutions assuming that the mean degree is large. We found\nthat the modularity is proportional to $\\langle \\sqrt{k} \\rangle / \\langle k\n\\rangle$ regardless of $q$ and that only the coefficient depends on $q$. In\nparticular, when the degree distribution follows a power law, the modularity is\nproportional to $\\langle k \\rangle^{-1/2}$. Our analytical results are\nconfirmed by comparison with numerical simulations. Therefore, our results can\nbe used as reference values for real-world networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 04:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

First, our setting includes the partial\ninformation structure of large-population system which is practical from real\napplication standpoint. Specially, two cases of partial information structure\nare considered here: the partial filtration case (see Section 2, 3) where the\navailable information to agents is the filtration generated by an observable\ncomponent of underlying Brownian motion; the noisy observation case (Section 4)\nwhere the individual agent can access an additive white-noise observation on\nits own state.

Drosophila dorsal closure (DC) has emerged as\na model system for studying the interplay between tissue mechanics and cellular\nactivity. Thereby, the amnioserosa (AS) generates one of the major forces that\ndrive DC through the apical contraction of its constituent cells. We combined\nquantitation of live data, genetic and mechanical perturbation and cell\nbiology, to investigate how mechanical properties and contraction rate emerge\nfrom cytoskeletal activity. We found that a decrease in Myosin phosphorylation\ninduces a fluidization of AS cells which become more compliant. Conversely, an\nincrease in Myosin phosphorylation and an increase in actin linear\npolymerization induce a solidification of cells. Contrary to expectation, these\ntwo perturbations have an opposite effect on the strain rate of cells during\nDC. While an increase in actin polymerization increases the contraction rate of\nAS cells, an increase in Myosin phosphorylation gives rise to cells that\ncontract very slowly. The quantification of how the perturbation induced by\nlaser ablation decays throughout the tissue revealed that the tissue in these\ntwo mutant backgrounds reacts very differently. We suggest that the differences\nin the strain rate of cells in situations where Myosin activity or actin\npolymerization is increased arise from changes in how the contractile forces\nare transmitted and coordinated across the tissue through ECadherin mediated\nadhesion.

Here we present direct\nimaging of spin waves in individual chains of ferromagnetically coupled $S=2$\nFe atoms, assembled one by one on a Cu$_2$N surface using a scanning tunnelling\nmicroscope. We are able to map the spin dynamics of these designer nanomagnets\nwith atomic resolution, in two complementary ways.

Second,\nwe observe slow stochastic switching between two opposite magnetisation states,\nwhose rate varies strongly depending on the location of the tip along the\nchain. Our observations, combined with model calculations, reveal that switches\nof the chain are initiated by a spin wave excited state which has its antinodes\nat the edges of the chain, followed by a domain wall shifting through the chain\nfrom one end to the other. This approach opens the way towards atomic scale\nimaging of other types of spin excitations, such as spinons and fractional\nend-states, in engineered spin chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 09:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

The derived analytical spectrum match perfectly the exact\ndiagonalization numerical solutions of the inhomogeneous TC model in the\nparameter regime where the qubits transition frequencies are far off-resonance\nwith the field frequency and the interaction strengths reach the ultra-strong\ncoupling regime. The two-qubit TC model is quasi-exactly solvable because part\nof the spectra can be determined exactly in the homogeneous coupling case with\ntwo identical qubits or with symmetric(asymmetric) detuning.

Starting from a\nperturbative solution to a generalised Hopfield model for the medium described\nby an $n=n(t)$ we provide estimates for the number of photons generated by the\ntime-dependent spacetime. The simplest example is that of a uniformly varying\n$\\eta(t)$ that therefore describes the Robertson-Walker metric, i.e. a\ncosmological expansion. The number of photon pairs generated in experimentally\nfeasible conditions appears to be extremely small. However, large photon\nproduction can be obtained by periodically modulating the medium and thus\nresorting to a resonant enhancement similar to that observed in the dynamical\nCasimir effect. Curiously, the spacetime metric in this case closely resembles\nthat of a gravitational wave. Motivated by this analogy we show that a periodic\ngravitational wave can indeed act as an amplifier for photons.

It claims that for a\nBanach algebra A, the intersection of the Jacobson radical of A** with A is\nprecisely the radical of A (this is claimed for either of the Arens products on\nA** - in itself a reasonable claim, because A is always contained in the\ntopological centre of A**, so a fixed a in A lies in the radical of A** with\nthe first Arens product, if and only if it lies in the radical of A** when that\nBanach space is given the second Arens product, if and only if ab is\nquasinilpotent for every b in A**).

Therefore, we conclude that this distribution inspired by\nSchr\\\"odinger's idea can not be used to construct an appropriate quantum\nequilibrium thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 14:11:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 09:44:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2015 17:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-10"}

Guarding against erasures\ninvolves redundancy in data representation. Mathematically this may be achieved\nby redundancy through the use of frames. One way to measure the robustness of a\nframe against erasures is to examine the worst case condition number of the\nframe with a certain number of vectors erased from the frame. The term {\\em\nnumerically erasure-robust frames (NERFs)} was introduced in \\cite{FicMix12} to\ngive a more precise characterization of erasure robustness of frames. In the\npaper the authors established that random frames whose entries are drawn\nindependently from the standard normal distribution can be robust against up to\napproximately 15\\% erasures, and asked whether there exist frames that are\nrobust against erasures of more than 50\\%.

Due to this effect, the synaptic weights have oscillating\nequilibrium values, which prevents the neuronal population from relaxing into a\nstationary macroscopic state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 14:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-14"}

However, many geophysical or climate models contains non-additive\nparameters such as those arising from physical parametrization of sub-grid\nscale processes, in which case the state augmentation technique may become\nineffective since its inference about parameters from partially observed states\nbased on the cross covariance between states and parameters is inadequate if\nstates and parameters are not linearly correlated.

The tunnel junction is embedded in a\nquarter wavelength resonator containing a dense SQUID array providing it with a\ncharacteristic impedance in the kOhms range and a resonant frequency tunable in\nthe 4-6 GHz range. Such high impedance gives rise to a sizeable Coulomb\nblockade on the tunnel junction (roughly 30% reduction in the differential\nconductance) and allows an efficient measurement of the spectral density of the\ncurrent fluctuations at the resonator frequency. The observed blockade of\nshot-noise is found in agreement with an extension of the dynamical Coulomb\nblockade theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Mar 2014 15:27:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Oct 2014 10:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-24"}

The physical components of such systems introduce safety\nrequirements, the achievement of which asks for the correct monitoring and\ncontrol from the discrete controllers. However, due to denial-of-service\nsecurity attack, the expected information from the controllers is not received\nand as a consequence the physical systems may fail to behave as expected. This\npaper proposes a formal framework for expressing denial-of-service security\nattack in hybrid systems. As a virtue, a physical system is able to plan for\nreasonable behavior in case the ideal control fails due to unreliable\ncommunication, in such a way that the safety of the system upon\ndenial-of-service is still guaranteed. In the context of the modeling language,\nwe develop an inference system for verifying safety of hybrid systems, without\nputting any assumptions on how the environments behave.

However, important\nphysiological information can be extracted from the way different brain regions\nare functionally coupled. In this study, we propose a novel approach that fuses\nspectral coherencebased connectivity between different brain regions as a\npossibly viable biometric feature. The proposed approach is tested on a large\ndataset of subjects (N=108) during eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting\nstate conditions. The obtained recognition performances show that using brain\nconnectivity leads to higher distinctiveness with respect to power-spectrum\nmeasurements, in both the experimental conditions. Notably, a 100% recognition\naccuracy is obtained in EC and EO when integrating functional connectivity\nbetween regions in the frontal lobe, while a lower 97.41% is obtained in EC\n(96.26% in EO) when fusing power spectrum information from centro-parietal\nregions.

A NuCAD, like a CAD, is a decomposition of\nn-dimensional real space into cylindrical cells. But unlike a CAD, the cells in\na NuCAD need not be arranged cylindrically. It is in this sense that NuCADs are\nnot uniformly cylindrical. However, NuCADs--- like CADs --- carry a tree-like\nstructure that relates different cells.
