However, synaptic polarities in this diagram, and\nthus, circuit functions are largely unknown. Here, we deciphered the likely\npolarities of 7 pre-motor neurons implicated in the control of worm's\nlocomotion, using a combination of experimental and computational tools. We\nperformed single and multiple laser ablations in the locomotor interneuron\ncircuit and recorded times the worms spent in forward and backward locomotion.\nWe constructed a theoretical model of the locomotor circuit and searched its\nall possible synaptic polarity combinations and sensory input patterns in order\nto find the best match to the timing data. The optimal solution is when either\nall or most of the interneurons are inhibitory and forward interneurons receive\nthe strongest input, which suggests that inhibition governs the dynamics of the\nlocomotor interneuron circuit. From the five pre-motor interneurons, only AVB\nand AVD are equally likely to be excitatory, i.e. they have probably similar\nnumber of inhibitory and excitatory connections to distant targets. The method\nused here has a general character and thus can be also applied to other neural\nsystems consisting of small functional networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 16:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-21"}

Hence an attractive feature of the Ph-A representation is\nthat it requires far fewer meshpoints than for the wave function itself. In\n1930 Milne developed an equation for the phase and the amplitude functions (W.\nE. Milne, Phys. Rev. 35, 863 (1930)), and in 1962 Seaton andPeach (M. J. Seaton\nand G. Peach, Proc. Phys.

Since the zero'th order term of the\niteration is identical to the WKB approximation, there is a close relationship\nbetween the Ph-A and the WKB representations of a wave function. The objective\nof the present study is to show that a spectral Chebyshev expansion method to\nsolve Seaton and Peach's iteration scheme is feasible, and requires very few\nmeshpoints for the whole radial interval. Hence this method provides an\neconomical and accurate way to calculate wave functions out to large distances.\nIn a numerical example for which the potential decreased slowly with distance\nas 1/r^3, the whole radial range of [0-2000] covered with 301 mesh points (and\nChbyshev basis functions).

A common approach used in the engineering literature to obtain the\nMAP state path is to discretize the dynamics and obtain the MAP state path for\nthe discretized system. In this paper, we prove that if the trapezoidal scheme\nis used for discretization, then the discretized MAP state path estimation\nconverges hypographically to the continuous-discrete MAP state path estimation\nas the discretization gets finer. However, if the stochastic Euler scheme is\nused instead, then the discretized estimation converges to the minimum energy\nestimation. The minimum energy estimates are, in turn, proved to be the state\npaths associated with the MAP noise paths, which in some cases differ from the\nMAP state paths.

Optical rogue\nwaves, in the form of pulses of high energy appearing much often than expected\nin a Gaussian distribution, are observed in the chaotic regime of the mode P2,\nbut not of P1. These high energy pulses appear in an unpredictable way, but it\nis observed that their separation (if measured in number of round trips) can\ntake only some definite values, which received the name of \"magic numbers\".

Recent stellar evolution\nmodels also predict pair instability supernovae (PISNe) from very massive stars\nat fairly high metallicities (i.e. Z~0.004). We provide supernova (SN) models\nand synthetic light curves for two progenitor models, a 150 Msun red-supergiant\nand a 250 Msun yellow-supergiant at a metallicity of Z=0.001, for which the\nevolution from the main sequence to collapse, and the initiation of the PISN\nitself, has been previously computed in a realistic and self-consistent way. We\nare using the radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA to describe the SN evolution\nof both models over a time frame of about 500 days. We describe the\nshock-breakout phases of both SNe which are characterized by a higher\nluminosity, a longer duration and a lower effective temperature than those of\nordinary SNeIIP. We derive the bolometric as well as the U, B, V, R and I light\ncurves of our PISN models, which show a long-lasting plateau phase with maxima\nat Mbol=-19.3 mag and -21.3 mag for our lower and higher mass model,\nrespectively. We also describe the photospheric composition and velocity as\nfunction of time. We conclude that the light curve of the explosion of our\ninitially 150 Msun star resembles those of relatively bright SNeIIP, whereas\nits photospheric velocity at early times is smaller. Its 56Ni mass of 0.04 Msun\nalso falls well into the range found in ordinary core collapse SNe. The light\ncurve and photospheric velocity of our 250 Msun models has a striking\nresemblance with that of the superluminous SN2007bi, strengthening its\ninterpretation as PISN.

We consider\ncompletely-positive quantum mechanical semigroups described by a Lindblad\nmaster equation. To prove the norm bound, we follow an approach which has its\nroots in the study of classical rate equations. We use interpolation theorems\nfor non-commutative $L_p$ spaces to obtain a general hypercontractive\ninequality from a particular $p \\rightarrow q$-norm bound.

The most established paradigm for studying brain\nmechanisms underlying conscious perception is to keep the physical sensory\ninputs constant and identify brain activities that correlate with the changing\ncontent of conscious awareness. However, such a contrast based on conscious\ncontent alone would not only reveal brain activities directly contributing to\nconscious perception, but also include brain activities that precede or follow\nit. To address this issue, we devised a paradigm whereby we collected,\ntrial-by-trial, measures of objective performance, subjective awareness, and\nthe confidence level of subjective awareness. Using magnetoencephalography\nrecordings in healthy human volunteers, we dissociated brain activities\nunderlying these different cognitive phenomena. Our results provide strong\nevidence that widely distributed slow cortical potentials (SCPs) correlate with\nsubjective awareness, even after the effects of objective performance and\nconfidence were both removed. The SCP correlate of conscious perception\nmanifests strongly in its waveform, phase, and power. In contrast, objective\nperformance and confidence were both contributed by relatively transient brain\nactivity.

We find that this leads to models in good agreement with recent\ndata. On the other hand, there are attempts in the literature to deviate from\nthis paradigm by invoking other symmetries and corrections. In particular: in a\nsuite of recent papers, several authors have made the claim that standard\nEinstein gravity with a cosmological constant and a massless scalar carries\nconformal symmetry. They further claim that such a theory carries another\nhidden symmetry; a global SO(1,1) symmetry. By deforming around the global\nSO(1,1) symmetry, they are able to produce a range of inflationary models with\nasymptotically flat potentials, whose flatness is claimed to be protected by\nthese symmetries. These models tend to give rise to B-modes with small\namplitude. Here we explain that these authors are merely introducing a\nredundancy into the description, not an actual conformal symmetry. Furthermore,\nwe explain that the only real (global) symmetry in these models is not at all\nhidden, but is completely manifest when expressed in the Einstein frame; it is\nin fact the shift symmetry of a scalar field. When analyzed systematically as\nan effective field theory, deformations do not generally produce asymptotically\nflat potentials and small B-modes, but other types of potentials with B-modes\nof appreciable amplitude. Such simple models typically also produce the\nobserved red spectral index, Gaussian fluctuations, etc. In short: simple\nmodels of inflation, organized by expanding around a shift symmetry, are in\nexcellent agreement with recent data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 19:56:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2015 21:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

We provide a manifest correspondence from the physical\nphenomena, the induced fractional quantum number and the zero energy mode\ndegeneracy, to the mathematical concept of cocycles that appears in the group\ncohomology classification of SPTs, thus achieving a concrete physical\nmaterialization of the cocycles. The aforementioned edge properties are\nformulated in terms of a long wavelength continuum field theory involving\nscalar chiral bosons, as well as in terms of Matrix Product Operators and\ndiscrete quantum lattice models. Our lattice approach yields a regularization\nwith anomalous non-onsite symmetry for the field theory description.

Observationally, for\nexoplanets with known mass and radius it is possible to estimate the bulk\ncomposition via internal structure models. We first determine the reduction\nfactor of the ISM grain opacity f_opa that leads to gas accretion rates\nconsistent with grain evolution models. We then compare the bulk composition of\nsynthetic low-mass and giant planets at different f_opa with observations. For\nf_opa=1 (full ISM opacity) the synthetic low-mass planets have too small radii,\ni.e., too low envelope masses compared to observations. At f_opa=0.003, the\nvalue calibrated with the grain evolution models, synthetic and actual planets\noccupy similar mass-radius loci. The mean enrichment of giant planets relative\nto the host star as a function of planet mass M can be approximated as\nZ_p/Z_star = beta*(M/M_Jup)^alpha. We find alpha=-0.7 independent of f_opa in\nsynthetic populations in agreement with the observational result (-0.71+-0.10).\nThe absolute enrichment level decreases from beta=8.5 at f_opa=1 to 3.5 at\nf_opa=0. At f_opa=0.003 one finds beta=7.2 which is similar to the\nobservational result (6.3+-1.0). We thus find observational hints that the\nopacity in protoplanetary atmospheres is much smaller than in the ISM even if\nthe specific value of the grain opacity cannot be constrained here. The result\nfor the enrichment of giant planets helps to distinguish core accretion and\ngravitational instability. In the simplest picture of core accretion where\nfirst a critical core forms and afterwards only gas is added, alpha=-1. If a\ncore accretes all planetesimals inside the feeding zone, alpha=-2/3. The\nobservational result lies between these values, pointing to core accretion as\nthe formation mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 20:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

We\npresent imaging at 19, 25, 31, and 37 {\\mu}m of the region containing these\nthree LBVs, obtained with SOFIA using FORCAST. We argue that the Pistol and\nG0.120-0.048 are identical ``twins\" that exhibit contrasting nebulae due to the\nexternal influence of their different environments. Our images reveal the\nasymmetric, compressed shell of hot dust surrounding the Pistol Star and\nprovide the first detection of the thermal emission from the symmetric, hot\ndust envelope surrounding G0.120-0.048. Dust and gas composing the Pistol\nnebula are primarily heated and ionized by the nearby Quintuplet Cluster stars.\nThe northern region of the Pistol nebula is decelerated due to the interaction\nwith the high-velocity (2000 km/s) winds from adjacent Wolf-Rayet Carbon (WC)\nstars. With the DustEM code we determine that the Pistol nebula is composed of\na distribution of very small, transiently-heated grains (10-~35 {\\AA}) and that\nit exhibits a gradient of decreasing grain size from the south to the north due\nto differential sputtering by the winds from the WC stars. Dust in the\nG0.120-0.048 nebula is primarily heated by the central star; however, the\nnebular gas is ionized externally by the Arches Cluster. Unlike the Pistol\nnebula, the G0.120-0.048 nebula is freely expanding into the surrounding\nmedium. Given independent dust and gas mass estimates we find that the Pistol\nand G0.120-0.048 nebulae exhibit similar gas-to-dust mass ratios of ~310 and\n~290, respectively. Both nebulae share identical size scales (~ 0.7 pc) which\nsuggests that they have similar dynamical timescales of ~10^5 yrs, assuming a\nshell expansion velocity of v_exp 60 km/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 21:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

This development has been partially driven by\nindividuals posting and storing data about themselves and friends using online\nsocial networks or collecting their data for self-tracking purposes\n(quantified-self movement). Across the sciences, researchers conduct studies\ncollecting data with an unprecedented resolution and scale. Using computational\npower combined with mathematical models, such rich datasets can be mined to\ninfer underlying patterns, thereby providing insights into human nature. Much\nof the data collected is sensitive. It is private in the sense that most\nindividuals would feel uncomfortable sharing their collected personal data\npublicly. For this reason, the need for solutions to ensure the privacy of the\nindividuals generating data has grown alongside the data collection efforts.\nOut of all the massive data collection efforts, this paper focuses on efforts\ndirectly instrumenting human behavior, and notes that -- in many cases -- the\nprivacy of participants is not sufficiently addressed. For example, study\npurposes are often not explicit, informed consent is ill-defined, and security\nand sharing protocols are only partially disclosed. This paper provides a\nsurvey of the work related to addressing privacy issues in research studies\nthat collect detailed sensor data on human behavior. Reflections on the key\nproblems and recommendations for future work are included. We hope the overview\nof the privacy-related practices in massive data collection studies can be used\nas a frame of reference for practitioners in the field. Although focused on\ndata collection in an academic context, we believe that many of the challenges\nand solutions we identify are also relevant and useful for other domains where\nmassive data collection takes place, including businesses and governments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 21:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-24"}

The method relies on a small number of\ndetections of the peak frequency in the postmerger phase for binaries of\ndifferent (relatively low) masses, in the most likely range of expected\ndetections. From such observations, one can construct the derivative of the\npeak frequency versus the binary mass, in this mass range. Through a detailed\nstudy of binary neutron star mergers for a large sample of equations of state,\nwe show that one can extrapolate the above information to the highest possible\nmass (the threshold mass for black hole formation in a binary neutron star\nmerger). In turn, this allows for an empirical determination of the maximum\nmass of cold, nonrotating neutron stars to within 0.1 M_sun, while the\ncorresponding radius is determined to within a few percent. Combining this with\nthe determination of the radius of cold, nonrotating neutron stars of 1.6 M_sun\n(to within a few percent, as was demonstrated in Bauswein et al., PRD, 86,\n063001, 2012), allows for a clear distinction of a particular candidate\nequation of state among a large set of other candidates. Our method is\nparticularly appealing because it reveals simultaneously the moderate and very\nhigh-density parts of the equation of state, enabling the distinction of\nmass-radius relations even if they are similar at typical neutron star masses.\nFurthermore, our method also allows to deduce the maximum central energy\ndensity and maximum central rest-mass density of cold, nonrotating neutron\nstars with an accuracy of a few per cent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 21:24:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jun 2014 09:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

We propose a cutting surface procedure based on multiple\ndiagonal perturbations to derive strong convex quadratic relaxations for\nnonconvex quadratic problem with separable constraints. Our resulting\nrelaxation does not use significantly more variables than the original problem,\nin contrast to many other relaxations based on lifting. The corresponding\nseparation problem is a highly structured semidefinite program (SDP) with\nconvex but non-smooth objective.

First, our\nseparation algorithm is at least an order of magnitude faster than interior\npoint methods for SDPs on problems up to a few hundred variables.

The system has\nbeen proposed as a model of hair initiation in the epidermal cells of plant\nroots. Specifically the model captures the kinetics of a small G-protein ROP,\nwhich can occur in active and inactive forms, and whose activation is believed\nto be mediated by a gradient of the plant hormone auxin. Here the model is made\nmore realistic with the inclusion of a transverse co-ordinate.

Transverse stability computations, confirmed by\nnumerical simulation show that, apart from a boundary stripe, these 1D\nsolutions typically undergo a transverse instability into spots.

The parameter values\nstudied lead to a natural singularly perturbed, so-called semi-strong\ninteraction regime. This scaling enables an analytical explanation of the\ninitial instability, by describing the dispersion relation of a certain\nnon-local eigenvalue problem. The analytical results are found to agree\nfavourably with the numerics.

First, the FUV-NUV color distribution of\nstars in the Kepler field consists of 2 distinct peaks. Second, curiously, for\nstars with spectral types G or later the mean FUV-NUV color becomes much bluer,\ncontrary to expectation. we have found in two samples of mid-F through K type\nstars that ~14-18% of them exhibit FUV-excesses relative to their NUV fluxes\nand spectral types.

Previous studies indicate the\nprimacy of intimate DNA contacts made by the specifically bound enzyme in\ncoordinating the two synchronized cuts. We propose that collective electronic\nbehavior in the DNA helix generates coherent oscillations, quantized through\nboundary conditions imposed by the endonuclease, that provide the energy\nrequired to break two phosphodiester bonds. Such quanta may be preserved in the\npresence of thermal noise and electromagnetic interference through decoherence\nshielding, the specific complex's exclusion of water and ions surrounding the\nhelix. Clamping energy imparted by the enzyme decoherence shield is comparable\nwith zero-point modes of the dipole-dipole oscillations in the DNA recognition\nsequence. The palindromic mirror symmetry of this sequence should conserve\nparity during the process. Experimental data corroborate that symmetric\nbond-breaking ceases when the symmetry of the endonuclease complex is violated,\nor when environmental parameters are perturbed far from biological optima.\nPersistent correlation between states in DNA sequence across spatial\nseparations of any length--a characteristic signature of quantum\nentanglement--may be explained by such a physical mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 01:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-24"}

Determining the Lee-Yang zeros is not\nonly fundamentally important for conceptual completeness of thermodynamics and\nstatistical physics but also technically useful for studying many-body systems.\nHowever, Lee-Yang zeros have never been observed in experiments, due to the\nintrinsic difficulty that Lee-Yang zeros would occur only at complex values of\nmagnetic field, which are unphysical.

Complete,\ncombinatorial motion planning approaches are theoretically well-rooted with\ncompleteness guarantees but they are hard to implement. Sampling-based and\nheuristic methods are easy to implement and quite simple to customize but they\nlack completeness guarantees. Can the best of both worlds be ever achieved,\nparticularly for mission critical applications such as robotic surgery, space\nexplorations, and handling hazardous material? In this paper, we answer\naffirmatively to that question.

Our algorithm encloses the roadmap with a\nchain of tiny boxes each of which contains a piece of the roadmap and whose\nconnectivity captures the roadmap connectivity. It starts by enclosing the\nentire space with a box. In each iteration, remaining boxes are shrunk on all\nsides and then split into smaller sized boxes. Those boxes that are empty are\ndetected in the shrink phase and removed. The algorithm terminates when all\nremaining boxes are smaller than a resolution that can be either given as input\nor automatically computed using root separation lower bounds. Shrink operation\nis cast as a polynomial optimization with semialgebraic constraints, which is\nin turn transformed into a (series of) semidefinite programs (SDP) using the\nLasserre's approach. NUROA's success is due to fast SDP solvers. NUROA\ncorrectly captured the connectivity of multiple curves/skeletons whereas\ncompetitors such as IBEX and Realpaver failed in some cases.

The proposed\napproach allows us to penalize the non-local variations, jointly for the\ndifferent components, through various $\\ell_{1,p}$ matrix norms with $p \\ge 1$.\nTo facilitate the choice of the hyper-parameters, we adopt a constrained convex\noptimization approach in which we minimize the data fidelity term subject to a\nconstraint involving the ST-NLTV regularization.

These values are\nexpected to bracket realistic rotation velocity distributions in stellar\npopulations. The new rotating models for massive stars are more luminous and\nhotter due to a larger convective core and enhanced surface abundances. This\nresults in pronounced changes in the integrated spectral energy distribution of\na population containing massive stars. The changes are most significant at the\nshortest wavelengths where an increase of the ionizing luminosity by up to a\nfactor of 5 is predicted. We also show that high equivalent widths of\nrecombination lines may not necessarily indicate a very young age but can be\nachieved at ages as late as 10 Myr.

For more than a\ncentury, this condition has played a relevant role in the theory of partial\ndifferential equations, as a shape assumption aimed to ensure the existence of\na solution for the classical Dirichlet problem on $S$. In a completely\ndifferent setting, this paper is devoted to analyze some statistical\napplications of the Poincar\\'{e} cone property (when defined in a slightly\nstronger version). First, we show that this condition can be seen as a sort of\ngeneralized convexity: while it is considerably less restrictive than\nconvexity, it still retains some ``convex flavour.'' In particular, when\nimposed to a probability support $S$, this property allows the estimation of\n$S$ from a random sample of points, using the ``hull principle'' much in the\nsame way as a convex support is estimated using the convex hull of the sample\npoints. The statistical properties of such hull estimator (consistency,\nconvergence rates, boundary estimation) are considered in detail. Second, it is\nshown that the class of sets fulfilling the Poincar\\'{e} property is a\n$P$-Glivenko-Cantelli class for any absolutely continuous distribution $P$ on\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$. This has some independent interest in the theory of empirical\nprocesses, since it extends the classical analogous result, established for\nconvex sets, to a much larger class. Third, an algorithm to approximate the\ncone-convex hull of a finite sample of points is proposed and some practical\nillustrations are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 13:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-24"}

High frequency quasiperiodic\noscillations (kHz QPOs), observed at frequencies matching orbital frequencies\nat tens of gravitational radii, offer a unique probe of the innermost disk\nregions. In this paper, we follow the lower kHz QPOs, in response to Type I\nX-ray bursts, in two prototypical QPO sources, namely 4U 1636-536 and 4U\n1608-522, as observed by the Proportional Counter Array of the Rossi X-ray\nTiming Explorer. We have selected a sample of 15 bursts for which the kHz QPO\nfrequency can be tracked on timescales commensurable with the burst durations\n(tens of seconds). We find evidence that the QPOs are affected for over ~200 s\nduring one exceptionally long burst and ~100 s during two others (although at a\nless significant level), while the burst emission has already decayed to a\nlevel that would enable the pre-burst QPO to be detected. On the other hand,\nfor most of our burst-kHz QPO sample, we show that the QPO is detected as soon\nas the statistics allow and in the best cases, we are able to set an upper\nlimit of ~20 s on the recovery time of the QPO. This diversity of behavior\ncannot be related to differences in burst peak luminosity. We discuss these\nresults in the framework of recent findings that accretion onto the neutron\nstar may be enhanced during Type I X-ray bursts. The subsequent disk depletion\ncould explain the disappearance of the QPO for ~100 s, as possibly observed in\ntwo events. However, alternative scenarios would have to be invoked for\nexplaining the short recovery timescales inferred from most bursts. Clearly the\ncombination of fast timing and spectral information of Type I X-ray bursts\nholds great potential in the study of the dynamics of the inner accretion flow\naround neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 14:19:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 14:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-05"}

The error function is expressed as the square\nof the difference between the actual observations and predicted values from an\nauto-associative neural network. In the event of missing data, all the values\nof the actual observations are not known hence, the error function is\ndecomposed to depend on the known and unknown variable values. Multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP) neural network is employed to train the neural networks using\nthe scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) method. Prediction accuracy is determined\nby mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute\nerror (MAE), and correlation coefficient (r) computations. Accuracy in\nclassification is obtained by plotting ROC curves and calculating the areas\nunder these. Analysis of results depicts that the approach using RF with AANN\nproduces the most accurate predictions and classifications while on the other\nend of the scale is the approach which entails using NS with AANN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 15:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-24"}

These\neffects result in effective, so-called critical Casimir forces (CCFs) acting on\nthe confining surfaces. These forces are attractive for like boundary\nconditions of the order parameter at the opposing surfaces of the confinement.\nFor colloidal particles dissolved in a binary liquid mixture acting as a\nsolvent close to its critical point of demixing, one thus expects the emergence\nof phase segregation into equilibrium colloidal liquid and gas phases. We\nanalyze how such phenomena occur asymmetrically in the whole thermodynamic\nneighborhood of the consolute point of the binary solvent. By applying\nfield-theoretical methods within mean-field approximation and the\nsemi-empirical de Gennes-Fisher functional, we study the CCFs acting between\nplanar parallel walls as well as between two spherical colloids and their\ndependence on temperature and on the composition of the near-critical binary\nmixture. We find that for compositions slightly poor in the molecules\npreferentially adsorbed at the surfaces, the CCFs are significantly stronger\nthan at the critical composition, thus leading to pronounced colloidal\nsegregation. The segregation phase diagram of the colloid solution following\nfrom the calculated effective pair potential between the colloids agrees\nsurprisingly well with experiments and simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 15:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-24"}

In the article the comparison is done in between them. For\nthe new programmers and the learners, it is important to understand them. The\nfunction overloading [1] is achieved at the time of the compile and the\nfunction overriding is achieved at the run time. The function overriding always\ntakes place in inheritance, but the function overloading can also take place\nwithout inheritance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 05:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-07"}

Approximating the contact between rough surfaces by the contact of an\nensemble of one-dimensional viscoelastic elements with a rough rigid surface,\nwe study the collective behavior of the elements. We find that collective\nresponse of the contacts can lead to macroscopic behavior very different from\nthe microscopic behavior. Specifically, various observed features of friction\nemerge as collective phenomena, without postulating them directly at the\nmicroscale. We discuss how parameters in our model can be related to material\nand surface properties of the contacting surfaces. We compare our results to\ncommonly used rate and state phenomenological models, and propose a new\ninterpretation of the state variable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2014 00:19:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}
