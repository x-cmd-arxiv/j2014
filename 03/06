The target\nstructures considered in those studies were low-coordinated crystals with a\nhigh degree of symmetry. In this paper, we further test the fundamental\nlimitations of radial pair potentials by targeting crystal structures with\nappreciably less symmetry, including those in which the particles have\ndifferent local structural environments. These challenging target\nconfigurations demanded that we modify previous inverse optimization\ntechniques. Using this modified optimization technique, we have designed\nshort-ranged radial pair potentials that stabilize the two-dimensional kagome\ncrystal, the rectangular kagome crystal, and rectangular lattices, as well as\nthe three-dimensional structure of CaF$_2$ crystal inhabited by a single\nparticle species. We verify our results by cooling liquid configurations to\nabsolute zero temperature via simulated annealing and ensuring that such states\nhave stable phonon spectra. Except for the rectangular kagome structure, all of\nthe target structures can be stabilized with monotonic repulsive potentials.\nOur work demonstrates that single-component systems with short-ranged radial\npair potentials can counterintuitively self-assemble into crystal ground states\nwith low symmetry and different local structural environments. Finally, we\npresent general principles that offer guidance in determining whether certain\ntarget structures can be achieved as ground states by radial pair potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 17:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-06"}

This contribution focuses on the estimation of the symmetry\nenergy from experiment and how it is related to the structure of neutron stars.\nThe most important connection is between the radii of neutron stars and the\npressure of neutron star matter in the vicinity of the nuclear saturation\ndensity $n_s$. This pressure is essentially controlled by the nuclear symmetry\nenergy parameters $S_v$ and $L$, the first two coefficients of a Taylor\nexpansion of the symmetry energy around $n_s$. We discuss constraints on these\nparameters that can be found from nuclear experiments. We demonstrate that\nthese constraints are largely model-independent by deriving them qualitatively\nfrom a simple nuclear model. We also summarize how recent theoretical studies\nof pure neutron matter can reinforce these constraints. To date, several\ndifferent astrophysical measurements of neutron star radii have been attempted.\nAttention is focused on photospheric radius expansion bursts and on thermal\nemissions from quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries. While none of these\nobservations can, at the present time, determine individual neutron star radii\nto better than 20% accuracy, the body of observations can be used with Bayesian\ntechniques to effectively constrain them to higher precision. These techniques\ninvert the structure equations and obtain estimates of the pressure-density\nrelation of neutron star matter, not only near $n_s$, but up to the highest\ndensities found in neutron star interiors.

The\nfields are induced by stochastic currents of scalar charged particles created\nduring the mentioned transition. We estimate the rms value of the induced\nmagnetic helicity by computing different four-point SQED Feynman diagrams. For\nany considered volume, the magnetic flux across its boundaries is in principle\nnon null, which means that the magnetic helicity in those regions is gauge\ndependent. We use the prescription given by Berger and Field and interpret our\nresult as the difference between two magnetic configurations that coincide in\nthe exterior volume. In this case the magnetic helicity gives only the number\nof magnetic links inside the considered volume. We calculate a concrete value\nof $H_M$ for large scales and analyze the distribution of magnetic defects as a\nfunction of the scale. Those defects correspond to regular as well as random\nfields in the considered volume. We find that the fractal dimension of the\ndistribution of topological defects is $D = 1/2$. We also study if the regular\nfields induced on large scales are helical, finding that they are and that the\nassociated number of magnetic defects is independent of the scale. In this case\nthe fractal dimension is $D=0$. We finally estimate the intensity of fields\ninduced at the horizon scale of reheating, and evolve them until the decoupling\nof matter and radiation under the hypothesis of inverse cascade of magnetic\nhelicity. The resulting intensity is high enough and the coherence length long\nenough to have an impact on the subsequent process of structure formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 17:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-07"}

This delay may hint at important physics,\nwhether it is due to the intrinsic variability of the inner engine or it is\nrelated to quantum dispersion effects in the velocity of light propagation from\nthe sources to the observer. It is critical to have a proper assessment of how\nthese time delays affect the overall properties of the light curves. We\ncross-correlated the 5 brightest GRBs of the 1st Fermi LAT Catalog by means of\nthe continuous correlation function (CCF) and of the Discrete Correlation\nFunction (DCF). A maximum in the DCF suggests the presence of a time lag\nbetween the curves, whose value and uncertainty are estimated through a\nGaussian fitting of the DCF profile and light curve simulation via a Monte\nCarlo approach. The cross-correlation of the observed LAT and GBM light curves\nyields time lags that are mostly similar to those reported in the literature,\nbut they are formally consistent with zero. The cross-correlation of the\nsimulated light curves yields smaller errors on the time lags and more than one\ntime lag for GRBs 090902B and 090926A; for all 5 GRBs, the time lags are\nsignificantly different from zero and consistent with those reported in the\nliterature, when only the secondary maxima are considered for those two GRBs.\nThe DCF method evidences the presence of time lags between the LAT and GBM\nlight curves and underlines their complexity. While this suggests that the\ndelays should be ascribed to intrinsic physical mechanisms, more sensitivity\nand larger statistics are needed to assess whether time lags are universally\npresent in the early GRB emission and which dynamical time scales they trace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 17:33:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 13:47:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Yet, the appearance of a thermophase is expected to\noccur in Josephson-coupled superconductors as well. Here we theoretically\ninvestigate the thermoelectric response of a thermally-biased Josephson\njunction based on a ferromagnetic insulator. In particular, we predict the\noccurrence of a very large thermophase which can reach $\\pi/2$ across the\ncontact for suitable temperatures and structure parameters, i.e., the\nquasiparticle thermal current can reach the critical current. Such a\nthermophase can be several orders of magnitude larger than that predicted to\noccur in conventional Josephson tunnel junctions.

Our equilibrium polymer simulations show\nthat a chromatin loop, formed by elements flanking either an enhancer or a\npromoter, suppresses enhancer-promoter interactions, working as an insulator. A\nloop formed by elements located in the region between an enhancer and a\npromoter, on the contrary, facilitates their interactions.

Current debate\nconcerns the pace at which domesticated plants emerged from cultivated wild\npopulations and how many genes were involved. Here we present simulations that\ntest how many genes could have been involved by considering the cost of\nselection. We demonstrate the selection load that can be endured by populations\nincreases with decreasing selection coefficients and greater numbers of loci\ndown to values of about s = 0.005, causing a driving force that increases the\nnumber of loci under selection. As the number of loci under selection\nincreases, an effect of co-selection increases resulting in individual unlinked\nloci being fixed more rapidly in out-crossing populations, representing a\nsecond driving force to increase the number of loci under selection. In\ninbreeding systems co-selection results in interference and reduced rates of\nfixation but does not reduce the size of the selection load that can be\nendured. These driving forces result in an optimum pace of genome evolution in\nwhich 50-100 loci are the most that could be under selection in a cultivation\nregime. Furthermore, the simulations do not preclude the existence of selective\nsweeps but demonstrate that they come at a cost of the selection load that can\nbe endured and consequently a reduction of the capacity of plants to adapt to\nnew environments, which may contribute to the explanation of why selective\nsweeps have been so rarely detected in genome studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 20:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-06"}

In particular, a noncooperative game is formulated between\ncustomer-owned storage units where each storage unit's owner can decide on\nwhether to charge or discharge energy with a given probability so as to\nmaximize a utility that reflects the tradeoff between the monetary transactions\nfrom charging/discharging and the penalty from power regulation. Unlike\nexisting game-theoretic works which assume that players make their decisions\nrationally and objectively, we use the new framework of prospect theory (PT) to\nexplicitly incorporate the users' subjective perceptions of their expected\nutilities. For the two-player game, we show the existence of a proper mixed\nNash equilibrium for both the standard game-theoretic case and the case with PT\nconsiderations. Simulation results show that incorporating user behavior via PT\nreveals several important insights into load management as well as economics of\nenergy storage usage. For instance, the results show that deviations from\nconventional game theory, as predicted by PT, can lead to undesirable grid\nloads and revenues thus requiring the power company to revisit its pricing\nschemes and the customers to reassess their energy storage usage choices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 20:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-06"}

The\ngamma-ray missions AGILE and Fermi have established, for the first time for a\nSNR, the spectral continuum below 200 MeV which can be attributed to neutral\npion emission. Confirming the hadronic origin of the gamma-ray emission near\n100 MeV is then of the greatest importance. Our paper is focused on a global\nre-assessment of all available data and models of particle acceleration in W44,\nwith the goal of determining on a firm ground the hadronic and leptonic\ncontributions to the overall spectrum. We also present new gamma-ray and CO\nNANTEN2 data on W44, and compare them with recently published AGILE and Fermi\ndata. Our analysis strengthens previous studies and observations of the W44\ncomplex environment and provides new information for a more detailed modeling.\nIn particular, we determine that the average gas density of the regions\nemitting 100 MeV - 10 GeV gamma-rays is relatively high (n= 250 - 300 cm^-3).\nThe hadronic interpretation of the gamma-ray spectrum of W44 is viable, and\nsupported by strong evidence. It implies a relatively large value for the\naverage magnetic field (B > 10^2 microG) in the SNR surroundings, sign of field\namplification by shock-driven turbulence. Our new analysis establishes that the\nspectral index of the proton energy distribution function is p1 = 2.2 +/- 0.1\nat low energies and p2 = 3.2 +/- 0.1 at high energies. We critically discuss\nhadronic versus leptonic-only models of emission taking into account\nsimultaneously radio and gamma-ray data. We find that the leptonic models are\ndisfavored by the combination of radio and gamma-ray data. Having determined\nthe hadronic nature of the gamma-ray emission on firm ground, a number of\ntheoretical challenges remains to be addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 20:56:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 10:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-14"}

Traditionally, only stable NP saddle points\nare considered in QFT, and homotopy group considerations are used to classify\nthem. However, in many QFTs the relevant homotopy groups are trivial, and even\nwhen they are non-trivial they leave many NP saddle points undetected.\nResurgence provides a refined classification of NP-saddles, going beyond\nconventional topological considerations.

In the MOL viewpoint, the partial differential equation is\ntreated as a large system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where an\nODE tailored time-integrator is applied. In contrast, Lax-Wendroff\ndiscretizations immediately convert Taylor series in time to discrete spatial\nderivatives. In this work, we propose the Picard integral formulation (PIF),\nwhich is based on the method of modified fluxes, and is used to derive new\nTaylor and Runge-Kutta (RK) methods. In particular, we construct a new class of\nconservative finite difference methods by applying WENO reconstructions to the\nso-called \"time-averaged\" fluxes. Our schemes are automatically conservative\nunder any modification of the fluxes, which is attributed to the fact that\nclassical WENO reconstructions conserve mass when coupled with forward Euler\ntime steps. The proposed Lax-Wendroff discretization is constructed by taking\nTaylor series of the flux function as opposed to Taylor series of the conserved\nvariables. The RK discretization differs from classical MOL formulations\nbecause we apply WENO reconstructions to time-averaged fluxes rather than\ntaking linear combinations of spatial derivatives of the flux. In both cases,\nwe only need one projection onto the characteristic variables per time step.\nThe PIF is generic, and lends itself to a multitude of options for further\ninvestigation. At present, we present two canonical examples: one based on\nTaylor, and the other based on the classical RK method. Stability analyses are\npresented for each method. The proposed schemes are applied to hyperbolic\nconservation laws in one- and two-dimensions and the results are in good\nagreement with current state of the art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 22:12:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Aug 2014 19:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-01"}

The root cause of this rack\nunderutilization is that the server nameplate power is often much higher than\ncan be reached in practice. To address rack underutilization, server vendors\nare shipping support for per-host power caps, which provide a server-enforced\nlimit on the amount of power that the server can draw. Using this feature,\ndatacenter operators can set power caps on the hosts in the rack to ensure that\nthe sum of those caps does not exceed the rack's provisioned power.

Based on this spin-momentum locking, a current flowing on the surface of a\nTI would be spin-polarized in a characteristic in-plane direction perpendicular\nto the current, and the spin-polarization would reverse when the current\ndirection reverses. Observing such a spin-helical current in transport\nmeasurements is a major goal in TI research and applications.

One possibility is that gas collapsing rapidly in pristine atomic\ncooling halos ($T_{\\rm vir} >\\sim 10^4 \\rm{K}$) produces $10^4-10^6 M_\\odot$\nblack holes. Previous studies have shown that the formation of such a black\nhole requires a strong UV background to prevent molecular hydrogen cooling and\ngas fragmentation.

Though molecular hydrogen\nformation may be delayed, it will eventually form at high densities leading to\nefficient cooling and fragmentation.

However, we argue\nthat the minimum core entropy, set by the entropy of the intergalactic medium\n(IGM) when it decouples from the CMB, prevents this from occurring for\nrealistic halo masses.

The proof uses a potential function related to a\ndeterminant. The result does not explain why the normalized Fourier transform\n(of unit determinant) should be difficult to compute in the same model. Hence,\nthe result is not scale insensitive.\n  More recently, Ailon (2013) showed that if only unitary 2-by-2 gates are\nused, and additionally no extra memory is allowed, then the normalized Fourier\ntransform requires $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ steps. This rather limited result is also\nsensitive to scaling, but highlights the complexity inherent in the Fourier\ntransform arising from introducing entropy, unlike, say, the identity matrix\n(which is as complex as the Fourier transform using Morgenstern's arguments,\nunder proper scaling).\n  In this work we extend the arguments of Ailon (2013). In the first extension,\nwhich is also the main contribution, we provide a lower bound for computing any\nscaling of the Fourier transform. Our restriction is that, the composition of\nall gates up to any point must be a well conditioned linear transformation. The\nlower bound is $\\Omega(R^{-1}n\\log n)$, where $R$ is the uniform condition\nnumber. Second, we assume extra space is allowed, as long as it contains\ninformation of bounded norm at the end of the computation.\n  The main technical contribution is an extension of matrix entropy used in\nAilon (2013) for unitary matrices to a potential function computable for any\nmatrix, using Shannon entropy on \"quasi-probabilities\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 01:02:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Mar 2014 14:46:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Mar 2014 17:04:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 29 Mar 2014 09:32:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 11:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-25"}

To fully exploit silicon's superior performance in a remarkably broad\nrange and to enable new optoelectronic functionalities, here we describe a\ngeneral method to integrate silicon photonic devices on arbitrary substrates.\nIn particular, we apply the technique to successfully integrate silicon\nmicro-ring resonators on mid-infrared compatible substrates for operation in\nthe mid-infrared. These high-performance mid-infrared optical resonators are\nutilized to demonstrate, for the first time, on-chip cavity-enhanced\nmid-infrared spectroscopic analysis of organic chemicals with a limit of\ndetection of less than 0.1 ng.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 03:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-07"}

We find several\nheavy-quark spin doublets in the open-bottom sectors, where anti-B and anti-B*\nmesons are present. In the meson sector we find several resonant states, among\nthem, a B0 and a B1 with masses 5530 MeV and 5579 MeV as well as Bs0* and Bs1*\nnarrow states at 5748 MeV and 5799 MeV, respectively. They form two doublets\nwith no experimental identification yet, the first one being the bottom\ncounterpart of the D0(2400) and D1(2430) states, and the second bottom doublet\nassociated to the ubiquitous Ds0* (2317) and the Ds1 (2460). In the baryon\nsector, several Lambda_b and Sigma_b doublets are identified, among them the\none given by the experimental Lambda_b(5910) and Lambda*_b(5921). Moreover, one\nof our states, the Sigma_b*(5904), turns out to be the bottom counterpart of\nthe Sigma*(1670) and Sigma_c*(2549), which is a case for discovery. We finally\nanalyze different transport coefficients for the anti-B meson in hot matter,\nsuch as formed in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC.

In this\nsetting, each job incurs a cost depending on its completion time, given by a\nprivate cost function, and one seeks to schedule the jobs to minimize the total\nsum of these costs. The framework captures many important scheduling objectives\nsuch as weighted flow time or weighted tardiness. Still, the general case as\nwell as the mentioned special cases are far from being very well understood\nyet, even for only one machine. Aiming for better general understanding of this\nproblem, in this paper we focus on the case of uniform job release dates on one\nmachine for which the state of the art is a 4-approximation algorithm. This is\ntrue even for a special case that is equivalent to the covering version of the\nwell-studied and prominent unsplittable flow on a path problem, which is\ninteresting in its own right. For that covering problem, we present a\nquasi-polynomial time $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that yields an\n$(e+\\epsilon)$-approximation for the above scheduling problem. Moreover, for\nthe latter we devise the best possible resource augmentation result regarding\nspeed: a polynomial time algorithm which computes a solution with \\emph{optimal\n}cost at $1+\\epsilon$ speedup. Finally, we present an elegant QPTAS for the\nspecial case where the cost functions of the jobs fall into at most $\\log n$\nmany classes. This algorithm allows the jobs even to have up to $\\log n$ many\ndistinct release dates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 08:45:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-07"}

This is used to correct the final image and it\nis shown that this purely statistical method is competitive with state of the\nart calibration techniques which require to incorporate fiducial markers into\nthe specimen. Moreover, a simple bootstrap algorithm allows to quantify the\nprecision of the drift estimate and its effect on the final image estimation.\nWe argue that purely statistical drift correction is even more robust than\nfiducial tracking rendering the latter superfluous in many applications.

Two different strains\nof the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus -- strain COL and its isogenic cell\nwall autolysis mutant -- were considered in this work. For low bacteria\ndensity, strain COL forms small clusters, while the mutant, presenting\ndeficient cell separation, forms irregular larger aggregates. In the early\nstages of growth, when subjected to a stationary shear, the viscosity of both\nstrains increases with the population of cells. As the bacteria reach the\nexponential phase of growth, the viscosity of the two strains follow different\nand rich behaviours, with no counterpart in the optical density or in the\npopulation's colony forming units measurements. While the viscosity of strain\nCOL keeps increasing during the exponential phase and returns close to its\ninitial value for the late phase of growth, where the population stabilizes,\nthe viscosity of the mutant strain decreases steeply, still in the exponential\nphase, remains constant for some time and increases again, reaching a constant\nplateau at a maximum value for the late phase of growth. These complex\nviscoelastic behaviours, which were observed to be shear stress dependent, are\na consequence of two coupled effects: the cell density continuous increase and\nits changing interacting properties. The viscous and elastic moduli of strain\nCOL, obtained with oscillatory shear, exhibit power-law behaviours whose\nexponent are dependent on the bacteria growth stage. The viscous and elastic\nmoduli of the mutant have complex behaviours, emerging from the different\nrelaxation times that are associated with the large molecules of the medium and\nthe self-organized structures of bacteria. These behaviours reflect\nnevertheless the bacteria growth stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 11:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Unfortunately, in most cases the parameters are completely\nunknown or only rough estimates of their values are available. Therefore, their\nvalues must be estimated from time-series experimental data.\n  In recent years, it has been suggested that dynamic systems biology models\nare universally sloppy so their parameters cannot be uniquely estimated. In\nthis work, we re-examine this concept, establishing links with the notions of\nidentifiability and experimental design. Further, considering a set of\nexamples, we address the following fundamental questions: i) is sloppiness\ninherent to model structure?; ii) is sloppiness influenced by experimental data\nor noise?; iii) does sloppiness mean that parameters cannot be identified?, and\niv) can sloppiness be modified by experimental design?\n  Our results indicate that sloppiness is not equivalent to lack of structural\nor practical identifiability (although they can be related), so sloppy models\ncan be identifiable. Therefore, drawing conclusions about the possibility of\nestimating unique parameter values by sloppiness analysis can be misleading.\nChecking structural and practical identifiability analyses is a better approach\nto asses the uniqueness and confidence in parameter estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 11:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-07"}

While most of\nthese shocks are weak and inefficient accelerators of cosmic rays (CRs), there\nare a number of strong, energetic shocks which can produce large amounts of CR\nprotons via diffusive shock acceleration.

As a result, the\nradial profile of the CR pressure in the intracluster medium is expected to be\nbroad, dropping off more slowly than that of the gas pressure, and might be\neven temporarily inverted, peaking in the outskirts. The volume-integrated\nmomentum spectrum of CR protons inside $r_{200}$ has the power-law slope of\n$4.25 - 4.5$, indicating that the average Mach number of the shocks of main CR\nproduction is in the range of $\\left< M_s \\right>_{\\rm CR} \\approx 3 - 4$.

While previous research has analyzed trending topics in a\nlong term, we look at the earliest tweets that produce a trend, with the aim of\ncategorizing trends early on. This would allow to provide a filtered subset of\ntrends to end users. We analyze and experiment with a set of straightforward\nlanguage-independent features based on the social spread of trends to\ncategorize them into the introduced typology. Our method provides an efficient\nway to accurately categorize trending topics without need of external data,\nenabling news organizations to discover breaking news in real-time, or to\nquickly identify viral memes that might enrich marketing decisions, among\nothers. The analysis of social features also reveals patterns associated with\neach type of trend, such as tweets about ongoing events being shorter as many\nwere likely sent from mobile devices, or memes having more retweets originating\nfrom a few trend-setters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 14:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-07"}

Electronic excitations however are\nknown to be delocalised due to the long range interaction of the charged\naccelerated electrons with the electrons in a sample. This has made several\nscientists question the value of combined high spatial and energy resolution\nfor mapping interband transitions and possibly phonon excitation in crystals.\nIn this paper we demonstrate experimentally that atomic resolution information\nis indeed available at very low energy losses around 100 meV expressed as a\nmodulation of the broadening of the zero loss peak. Careful data analysis\nallows us to get a glimpse of what are likely phonon excitations with both an\nenergy loss and gain part. These experiments confirm recent theoretical\npredictions on the strong localisation of phonon excitations as opposed to\nelectronic excitations and show that a combination of atomic resolution and\nrecent developments in increased energy resolution will offer great benefit for\nmapping phonon modes in real space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 09:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-10"}
