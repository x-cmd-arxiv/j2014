A possible solution is provided by asymmetric liquidity, which\nstates that the impact of a buy or sell order is inversely related to the\nprobability of its occurrence.

We present three basic\nmethodologies to demonstrate different approaches to harness the resulting\nnetwork gain. First, a multiple linear regression optimisation algorithm is\nused to generate a relational network between individual components of national\nbalance of payment accounts. This model describes annual statistics with a high\naccuracy and delivers good forecasts for the majority of indicators. Second, an\nearly-warning mechanism for global financial crises is presented, which\ncombines network measures with standard economic indicators. From the analysis\nof the cross-border portfolio investment network of long-term debt securities,\nthe proliferation of a wide range of over-the-counter-traded financial\nderivative products, such as credit default swaps, can be described in terms of\ngross-market values and notional outstanding amounts, which are associated with\nincreased levels of market interdependence and systemic risk. Third,\nconsidering the flow-network of goods traded between G-20 economies, network\nstatistics provide better proxies for key economic measures than conventional\nindicators.

The r-mode interpretation has connections with proposed spin-evolution\nscenarios for systems such as XTE J1751-305. Here we examine in detail this\ninteresting possible interpretation. Using the ratio of the observed\noscillation frequency to the star's spin frequency, we derive an approximate\nneutron star mass-radius relation which yields reasonable values for the mass\nover the range of expected stellar radius (as constrained by observations of\nradius-expansion burst sources). However, we argue that the large mode\namplitude suggested by the Strohmayer and Mahmoodifar analysis would inevitably\nlead to a large spin-down of the star, inconsistent with its observed spin\nevolution, regardless of whether the r-mode itself is in a stable or unstable\nregime. We therefore conclude that the r-mode interpretation of the observed\noscillation is not consistent with our current understanding of neutron star\ndynamics and must be considered unlikely. Finally we note that, subject to the\navailability of a sufficiently accurate timing model, a direct\ngravitational-wave search may be able to confirm or reject an r-mode\ninterpretation unambiguously, should such an event, with a similar inferred\nmode amplitude, recur during the Advanced detector era.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 17:04:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Mar 2014 09:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-06-18"}

Using a novel coordinate-space method, we find the\nneutron propagates in a coordinate-dependent effective potential that we obtain\nby integrating out charged pions winding around the torus. Knowledge of these\nfinite volume effects will aid in the extraction of neutron properties from\nlattice QCD computations in external magnetic fields.

Conceptual models that capture some\nrelevant aspects of the process exist but their full explanatory power is not\nyet exhausted. In the current study, we introduce the robustness criterion\nwhich defines the conditions for stable locomotion when steps are taken with\nimprecise angle of attack. Intuitively, the necessity of a higher precision\nindicates the difficulty to continue moving with a given gait. We show that the\nspring-loaded inverted pendulum model, under the robustness criterion, is\nconsistent with previously reported findings on attentional demand during human\nlocomotion. This criterion allows transitions between running and walking, many\nof which conserve forward speed. Simulations of transitions predict Froude\nnumbers below the ones observed in humans, nevertheless the model\nsatisfactorily reproduces several biomechanical indicators such as hip\nexcursion, gait duty factor and vertical ground reaction force profiles.\nFurthermore, we identify reversible robust walk-run transitions, which allow\nthe system to execute a robust version of the hopping gait.

It is\na wonderful example of application of group theory in dynamical systems and, in\nparticular, in holomorphic dynamics. Iterated monodromy groups encode in a\ncomputationally efficient way combinatorial information about any dynamical\nsystem induced by a post-critically finite branched covering. Their power was\nillustrated by a solution of the Hubbard Twisted Rabbit Problem given by\nBartholdi and Nekrashevych.\n  These notes attempt to introduce this theory for those who are familiar with\nholomorphic dynamics but not with group theory. The aims are to give all\nexplanations needed to understand the main definition and to provide skills in\ncomputing any iterated monodromy group efficiently. Moreover some explicit\nlinks between iterated monodromy groups and holomorphic dynamics are detailed.\nIn particular, combinatorial equivalence classes and matings of polynomials are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 18:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

The physical processes giving rise to the X-ray flares are uncertain.\nHere we report the detection with the NuSTAR observatory in Summer and Fall\n2012 of four low to medium amplitude X-ray flares to energies up to 79 keV. For\nthe first time, we clearly see that the power-law spectrum of Sagittarius A*\nX-ray flares extends to high energy, with no evidence for a cut off. Although\nthe photon index of the absorbed power-law fits are in agreement with past\nobservations, we find a difference between the photon index of two of the\nflares (significant at the 95% confidence level). The spectra of the two\nbrightest flares (~55 times quiescence in the 2-10 keV band) are compared to\nsimple physical models in an attempt to identify the main X-ray emission\nmechanism, but the data do not allow us to significantly discriminate between\nthem. However, we confirm the previous finding that the parameters obtained\nwith synchrotron models are, for the X-ray emission, physically more reasonable\nthan those obtained with inverse-Compton models. One flare exhibits large and\nrapid (< 100 s) variability, which, considering the total energy radiated,\nconstrains the location of the flaring region to be within ~10 Schwarzschild\nradii of the black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 19:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Mar 2014 20:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

The\nmodel is able to approximate the fundamental features of the climate obtained\nfrom three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric general circulation model (GCM)\nsimulations. One important reason for the two-column model's success is that it\nreproduces the high cloud albedo of the GCM simulations, which reduces the\nplanet's temperature and delays the onset of a runaway greenhouse state. The\ntwo-column model also clearly illustrates a secondary mechanism for determining\nthe climate: the nightside acts as a ``radiator fin'' through which infrared\nenergy can be lost to space easily. This radiator fin is maintained by a\ntemperature inversion and dry air on the nightside, and plays a similar role to\nthe subtropics on modern Earth. Since 1D radiative-convective models cannot\ncapture the effects of the cloud albedo and radiator fin, they are\nsystematically biased towards a narrower habitable zone. We also show that\ncloud parameters are most important for determining the day--night thermal\nemission contrast in the two-column model, which decreases and eventually\nreverses as the stellar flux increases. This reversal is important because it\ncould be detected by future extrasolar planet characterization missions, which\nwould suggest that the planet has Earth-like water clouds and is potentially\nhabitable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 19:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In the absence of disorder such\npairing can support both line and point nodes, and both types of nodal\nquasiparticles exhibit nontrivial topology in the momentum space. The point\nnodes, located at the intersections of the closed Fermi surfaces with the\n$c$-axis, act as the double monopoles and the antimonopoles of the Berry\ncurvature, and generalize the notion of Weyl quasiparticles. Consequently, the\n$B$ phase should support an anomalous thermal Hall effect, the polar Kerr\neffect, in addition to the protected Fermi arcs on the (1,0,0) and the (0,1,0)\nsurfaces. The line node at the Fermi surface equator acts as a vortex loop in\nthe momentum space and gives rise to the zero energy, dispersionless Andreev\nbound states on the (0,0,1) surface. At the transition from the $B$-phase to\nthe $A$-phase, the time reversal symmetry is restored, and only the line node\nsurvives inside the $A$-phase. As both line and double-Weyl point nodes possess\nlinearly vanishing density of states, we show that weak disorder acts as a\nmarginally relevant perturbation. Consequently, an infinitesimal amount of\ndisorder destroys the ballistic quasiparticle pole, while giving rise to a\ndiffusive phase with a finite density of states at the zero energy. The\nresulting diffusive phase exhibits $T$-linear specific heat, and an anomalous\nthermal Hall effect.

For CIV (and HI) we detect a significant enhancement of the\nabsorption signal out to 2 pMpc in the transverse direction, corresponding to\nthe maximum impact parameter in our sample. After normalising the median\nabsorption profiles to account for variations in line strengths and detection\nlimits, in the transverse direction we find no evidence for a sharp drop-off in\nmetals distinct from that of HI. We argue instead that non-detection of some\nmetal line species in the extended circumgalactic medium is consistent with\ndifferences in the detection sensitivity. We also present measurements of\ncovering fractions and equivalent widths as a function of projected galaxy\ndistance. Limiting the sample to the 340 galaxies with redshifts measured from\nnebular emission lines does not decrease the extent of the enhancement along\nthe LOS compared to that in the transverse direction. This rules out redshift\nerrors as the source of the observed redshift-space anisotropy and thus implies\nthat we have detected the signature of gas peculiar velocities from infall,\noutflows, or virial motions for HI, OVI, CIV, CIII, and CIV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 21:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Sep 2014 12:36:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 15:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-10"}

Current-voltage\ncharacteristics, Lyapunov exponents and Poincare sections are analyzed in\ndetail. It is found that the subharmonic Shapiro steps at certain parameters\nare separated by structured chaotic windows. By performing a linear regression\non the linear part of the data, a fractal dimension of D = 0.868 is obtained,\nwith an uncertainty of +-0.012. The chaotic regions exhibit scaling similarity\nand it is shown that the devil's staircase of the system can form a backbone\nthat unifies and explains the highly correlated and structured chaotic\nbehavior. These features suggest a system possessing multiple complete devil's\nstaircases. The onset of chaos for subharmonic steps occurs through the\nFeigenbaum period doubling scenario.

Scale-free networks on which the GS\nmodel is placed are constructed from the static model, in which the number of\nvertices is fixed from the beginning. On the basis of the replica-symmetric\nsolution, we obtain the analytical solutions, i.e., free energy and order\nparameters, and we derive the various phase diagrams consisting of the\nparamagnetic, ferromagnetic, and spin glass phases as functions of temperature\n$T$, the degree exponent $\\lambda$, the mean degree $K$, and the fraction of\nthe ferromagnetic interactions $\\rho$. Since the present model is based on the\nGS model, which considers the three states ($S=0, \\pm 1$), the $S=0$ state\nplays a crucial role in the $\\lambda$-dependent critical behavior: glass\ntransition temperature $T_{g}$ has a finite value, even when $2 < \\lambda < 3$.\nIn addition, when the crystal field becomes nonzero, the present model clearly\nexhibits three types of inverse transitions, which occur when an ordered phase\nis more entropic than a disordered one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 00:56:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Mar 2014 07:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-14"}

One such mobile network that has drawn\nattention of researchers in the past few years is the Airborne Networks (AN)\ndue to its importance in civil and military purpose and due to the several\ncomplex issues in these domains. Since the nodes in an airborne network (AN)\nare heterogeneous and mobile, the design of a reliable and robust AN is highly\ncomplex and challenging. In this paper a persistent backbone based architecture\nfor an AN has been considered where a set of airborne networking platforms\n(ANPs - aircrafts, UAVs and satellites) form the backbone of the AN. End to end\nconnectivity of the backbone nodes is crucial in providing the communication\namong the hosts. Since ANPs are prone to failure because of attacks like EMP\nattack or jamming, another important issue is to improve the robustness of the\nbackbone network against these attacks. Such attacks will impact specific\ngeographic regions at specific times and if an ANP is within the fault region\nduring the time of attack, it will fail. This paper focuses on connectivity and\nfault-tolerance issues in ANs and studies algorithms to compute the minimum\ntransmission range of ANPs in fault free and faulty scenarios to ensure network\nconnectivity all the times. It also considers the scenario where the network\nmay have to operate in a disconnected mode for some part of time and data\ntransmissions may be tolerant to some amount of delay. Hence, ANPs may not need\nto have end-to-end paths all the time but they should be able to transmit data\nto each other within bounded time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 01:28:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-06"}

The velocity field\nshows a strong gradient along the clump's major axis, with the blue-shifted\nside at higher Galactic longitude. The optically thick gas tracers are\nsystematically red-shifted with respect to the optically thin and hot gas\ntracers, indicating radial motions. The gas kinematics and line ratios support\nthe recently proposed scenario in which G0.253+0.016 results from a tidal\ncompression during a recent pericentre passage near SgrA*. Because G0.253+0.016\nrepresents an excellent example of a clump that may form a high-mass cluster,\nits detailed study should reveal a wealth of knowledge about the early stages\nof cluster formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 03:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

This\nalignment is dependent on galaxy properties, such that red satellites are more\nstrongly aligned than blue satellites. Theoretical work done to interpret this\nphenomena has found that it is due to the non-spherical nature of dark matter\nhalos. However, most studies over-predict the alignment signal under the\nassumption that the central galaxy shape follows the shape of the host halo. It\nis also not clear whether the color dependence of alignment is due to an\nassembly bias or an evolution effect. In this paper we study these problems\nusing a cosmological N-body simulation. Subhalos are used to trace the\npositions of satellite galaxies. It is found that the shape of dark matter\nhalos are mis-aligned at different radii. If the central galaxy shares the same\nshape as the inner host halo, then the alignment effect is weaker and agrees\nwith observational data. However, it predicts almost no dependence of alignment\non the color of satellite galaxies, though the late accreted subhalos show\nstronger alignment with the outer layer of the host halo than their early\naccreted counterparts. We find that this is due to the limitation of pure\nN-body simulations that satellites galaxies without associated subhalos\n('orphan galaxies') are not resolved.

It is also shown\nthat for a switched nonlinear system with three or more sub-systems, the \"if\"\npart holds, but the \"only if\" part may not.\n  At last, the S-Lemma is extended from quadratic polynomials to polynomials of\ndegree more than $2$ under some mild conditions, and the improved results are\ncalled the homogeneous S-Lemma (the HS-Lemma for short) and the non-homogeneous\nS-Lemma (the NHS-Lemma for short), respectively.\n  Besides, some examples and counterexamples are given to illustrate the main\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 06:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-06"}

Here we report on the X-ray activity of the primary star, HD189733\nA, using a new XMM-Newton observation and a comparison with the previous X-ray\nobservations. The spectrum in the quiescent intervals is described by two\ntemperatures at 0.2 keV and 0.7 keV, while during the flares a third component\nat 0.9 keV is detected. We obtain estimates of the electron density in the\nrange $n_e = 1.6 - 13 \\times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ and thus the corona of HD189733\nA appears denser than the solar one. {For the third time, we observe a large\nflare that occurred just after the eclipse of the planet. Together with the\nflares observed in 2009 and 2011, the events are restricted to a small\nplanetary phase range of $\\phi = 0.55-0.65$. Although we do not find conclusive\nevidence of a significant excess of flares after the secondary transits, we\nsuggest that the planet might trigger such flares when it passes close to\nlocally high magnetic field of the underlying star at particular combinations\nof stellar rotational phases and orbital planetary phases. For the most recent\nflares, a wavelet analysis of the light curve suggests a loop of length of four\nstellar radii at the location of the bright flare, and a local magnetic field\nof order of 40-100 G, in agreement with the global field measured in other\nstudies. The loop size suggests an interaction of magnetic nature between\nplanet and star, separated by only $\\sim8 R_*$. We also detect the stellar\ncompanion (HD 189733 B, $\\sim12\"$ from the primary star) in this XMM\nobservation. Its very low X-ray luminosity ($L_X = 3.4\\times 10^{26}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$) confirms the old age of this star and of the binary system. The high\nactivity of the primary star is best explained by a transfer of angular\nmomentum from the planet to the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 07:50:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

In this paper, we\nreevaluate the feasibility of low-mass planet detections considering\nphotometric precision for different populations of source stars.

Recently, Brunel et al.\ndeveloped a framework to describe this kind of fast sparse synchronization in\nboth random and globally-coupled networks of suprathreshold spiking neurons.\nHowever, in a real cortical circuit, synaptic connections are known to have\ncomplex topology which is neither regular nor random. Hence, in order to extend\nthe works of Brunel et al. to realistic neural networks, we study the effect of\nnetwork architecture on these fast sparsely synchronized rhythms in an\ninhibitory population of suprathreshold fast spiking (FS) Izhikevich\ninterneurons. We first employ the conventional Erd\\\"{o}s-Renyi random graph of\nsuprathreshold FS Izhikevich interneurons for modeling the complex connectivity\nin neural systems, and study emergence of the population synchronized states by\nvarying both the synaptic inhibition strength $J$ and the noise intensity $D$.\nThus, fast sparsely synchronized states of relatively high degree are found to\nappear for large values of $J$ and $D$. Second, for fixed values of $J$ and $D$\nwhere fast sparse synchronization occurs in the random network, we consider the\nWatts-Strogatz small-world network of suprathreshold FS Izhikevich interneurons\nwhich interpolates between regular lattice and random graph via rewiring, and\ninvestigate the effect of small-world synaptic connectivity on emergence of\nfast sparsely synchronized rhythms by varying the rewiring probability $p$ from\nshort-range to long-range connection.

As $J$ is\nincreased, rich types of population synchronization (e.g., spike, burst, and\nfast spike synchronization) are found to occur.

We show in detail how the building of\nsupersymmetry on potentials with delta interactions placed in two or more\npoints on the real line requires the inclusion of quasi-square wells.\nTherefore, the basic ingredient of a supersymmetric Hamiltonian containing two\nor more Dirac-$\\delta$s is the singular potential formed by a Dirac-$\\delta$\nplus a step ($\\theta$) at the same point. In this $\\delta/\\theta$ SUSY\nHamiltonian there is only one singlet ground state of zero energy annihilated\nby the two supercharges or a doublet of ground states paired by supersymmetry\nof positive energy depending on the relation between the Dirac well strength\nand the height of the step potential.

We explain next the different structure of the scattering waves\nproduced by three $\\delta/\\theta$ potentials with respect to the eigenfunctions\narising in the non-SUSY case. In particular, many more bound states paired by\nsupersymmetry exist within the supersymmetric framework compared with the\nnon-SUSY problem.

The galaxy images are reconstructed using the PCA basis\nand subtracted from the data. We then filter the residual image with two\ndifferent methods. The first uses a curvelet (curved wavelets) filter of the\nresidual images to enhance any curved/ring feature. The resulting image is\ntransformed in polar coordinates, centered on the lens galaxy center. In these\ncoordinates, a ring is turned into a line, allowing us to detect very faint\nrings by taking advantage of the integrated signal-to-noise in the ring (a line\nin polar coordinates). The second way of analysing the PCA-subtracted images\nidentifies structures in the residual images and assesses whether they are\nlensed images according to their orientation, multiplicity and elongation. We\napply the two methods to a sample of simulated Einstein rings, as they would be\nobserved with the ESA Euclid satellite in the VIS band.

The fate of the black hole is\ndictated by the two opposite mechanics i.e. accretion of nuclear matter from\nthe center of the star and Hawking radiation that tends to decrease the mass of\nthe black hole. We study how the assumptions for the accretion rate can in fact\naffect the critical mass beyond which a black hole always grows. We also study\nto what extent degenerate nuclear matter can impede Hawking radiation due to\nthe fact that emitted particles can be Pauli blocked at the core of the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 10:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}

If the DM abundance is due to a dark\nparticle-antiparticle asymmetry, the DM annihilation cross-section can be\narbitrarily large, and the coupling of DM to the light species can be\nsignificant. We consider the case of asymmetric DM interacting via a light (but\nnot necessarily massless) Abelian gauge vector boson, a dark photon. In the\nmassless dark photon limit, gauge invariance mandates that DM be\nmulticomponent, consisting of positive and negative dark ions of different\nspecies which partially bind in neutral dark atoms. We argue that a similar\nconclusion holds for light dark photons; in particular, we establish that the\nmulti-component and atomic character of DM persists in much of the parameter\nspace where the dark photon is sufficiently light to mediate sizeable DM\nself-interactions. We discuss the cosmological sequence of events in this\nscenario, including the dark asymmetry generation, the freeze-out of\nannihilations, the dark recombination and the phase transition which gives mass\nto the dark photon.

Furthermore,\nsome sophisticated banks are including an FVA (Funding Valuation Adjustment),\nbut since DVA can be interpreted as a funding benefit the oft-debated issue\nregarding a possible double-counting of funding benefits arises, with little\nconsensus as to its resolution. One possibility is to price the derivative by\nreplication, guaranteeing a consistent inclusion of costs and benefits.\nHowever, as has recently been noted, DVA is (at least partially) unhedgeable,\nhaving no exact market hedge. Furthermore, current frameworks shed little light\non the controversial question, raised by Hull (2012), of whether the effect a\nderivative has on the riskiness of an institution's debt should be taken into\naccount when calculating FVA.\n  In this paper we propose a solution to these two problems by identifying an\ninstrument, a fictitious CDS written on the hedging counterparty which is\nimplicitly contained in any given derivatives transaction. This allows us to\nshow that the hedger's unhedged jump-to-default risk has, despite not being\nactively managed, a well defined value associated to a funding benefit.\nCarrying out the replication including such a CDS, we obtain a price for the\nderivative consisting of its collateralized equivalent, a contingent CVA, a\ncontingent DVA, and an FVA, coupled to the price via the hedger's short-term\nbond-CDS basis.\n  The resulting funding cost is non-zero, but substantially smaller than what\nis obtained in alternative approaches due to the effect the derivative has on\nthe recovery of the hedger's liabilities. Also, price agreement is possible for\ntwo sophisticated counterparties entering a deal if their bond-CDS bases obey a\ncertain relationship, similar to what was first obtained by Morini and\nPrampolini (2010).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 11:39:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Apr 2014 22:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-22"}

Multiple observations of a number of point-like sources\nshow that the repeatability of the calibration is better than 1%, if the\neffects of the satellite absolute pointing error (APE) are corrected. The\nsatellite APE leads to a decrement in the derived flux, which can be up to ~10%\n(1 sigma) at the high-frequency end of the SPIRE range in the first part of the\nmission, and ~4% after Herschel operational day 1011. The lower frequency range\nof the SPIRE band is unaffected by this pointing error due to the larger beam\nsize. Overall, for well-pointed, point-like sources, the absolute flux\ncalibration is better than 6%, and for extended sources where mapping is\nrequired it is better than 7%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 13:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Method: Five master level students in the field of IS\nassessed a set of 24 papers using the relevance checklist1. For each question\nin the checklist, inter-rater agreement has been calculated and the reasoning\nthat the practitioners applied has been reconstructed from comments. Results:\nInter-rater agreement only showed to be slight for three questions and poor for\nall other questions. Analysis of comments provided by the practitioners showed\nonly two questions that were interpreted in the same way by all practitioners.\nThese two questions showed significantly higher inter-rater agreement than\nother questions.

In particular, it has been shown that the weak RF\nincreases the mean energy loss for small angles between the velocity of the REB\nand the direction of polarization of the RF while decreasing it at large\nangles. Furthermore, the relative deviation of the energy loss from the\nfield-free value is strongly reduced with increasing the beam energy. Special\ncase of the parallel orientation of the polarization of the RF with respect to\nthe beam velocity has been also considered. At high-intensities of the RF two\nextreme regimes have been distinguished when the excited harmonics cancel\neffectively each other reducing strongly the energy loss or increasing it due\nto the constructive interference. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the\nenergy loss of the ultrarelativistic electron beam increases systematically\nwith the intensity of the RF exceeding essentially the field-free value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 13:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-06"}

As Ca occupies sites\noutside but near the Cu-O-Cu spin chains, bond disorder, i.e. a spatial\nvariation of the exchange interaction $J$, is expected to be realized in these\nchains. We observe that the magnetic heat conductivity\n($\\kappa_{\\mathrm{mag}}$) due to spinons propagating in the chains is gradually\nbut strongly suppressed with increasing amount of Ca, where the doping\ndependence can be understood in terms of increased scattering of spinons due to\nCa-induced disorder. This is also reflected in the spinon mean free path which\ncan be separated in a doping independent but temperature dependent scattering\nlength due to spinon-phonon scattering, and a temperature independent but\ndoping dependent spinon-defect scattering length. The latter spans from very\nlarge ($>$ 1300 lattice spacings) to very short ($\\sim$ 12 lattice spacings)\nand scales with the average distance between two neighboring Ca atoms. Thus,\nthe Ca-induced disorder acts as an effective defect within the spin chain, and\nthe doping scheme allows to cover the whole doping regime between the clean and\nthe dirty limits. Interestingly, at maximum impurity level we observe, in\nCa-doped Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, an almost linear increase of $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{mag}}$ at\ntemperatures above 100 K which reflects the intrinsic low temperature behavior\nof heat transport in a Heisenberg spin chain. These findings are quite\ndifferent from that observed for the Ca-doped double spin chain compound,\nSrCuO$_2$, where the effect of Ca seems to saturate already at intermediate\ndoping levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 14:39:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Mar 2014 15:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-31"}

For consistency, we\nfirst evolve a set of 15Msun main sequence stars at 0.1, 0.4, 1, and 2 x the\nsolar metallicity. At the onset of core collapse, we trigger a piston-driven\nexplosion and model the resulting ejecta and radiation. Our theoretical models\nof such red-supergiant-star explosions at different metallicity show that\nsynthetic spectra of SNe II-P possess optical signatures during the\nrecombination phase that are sensitive to metallicity variations. This\nsensitivity can be quantified and the metallicity inferred from the strength of\nmetal-line absorptions. Furthermore, these signatures are not limited to O, but\nalso include Na, Ca, Sc, Ti, or Fe. When compared to a sample of SNe II-P from\nthe Carnegie SN Project and previous SN followup programs, we find that most\nevents lie at a metallicity between 0.4 and 2 x solar, with a marked scarcity\nof SN II-P events at SMC metallicity. This most likely reflects the paucity of\nlow metallicity star forming regions in the local Universe.\n  SNe II-P have high plateau luminosities that make them observable\nspectroscopically at large distances. Because they exhibit signatures of\ndiverse metal species, in the future they may offer a means to constrain the\nevolution of the composition (e.g., the O/Fe ratio) in the Universe out to a\nredshift of one and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 15:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Neural\nsynchronization may be well described by using the population-averaged global\npotential $V_G$ in computational neuroscience. The time-averaged fluctuation of\n$V_G$ plays the role of a \"thermodynamic\" order parameter $\\cal {O}$ used for\ndescribing the synchrony-asynchrony transition in neural systems. Population\nspike synchronization may be well visualized in the raster plot of neural\nspikes. The degree of neural synchronization seen in the raster plot is well\nmeasured in terms of a \"statistical-mechanical\" spike-based measure $M_s$\nintroduced by considering the occupation and the pacing patterns of spikes. The\nglobal potential $V_G$ is also used to give a reference global cycle for the\ncalculation of $M_s$. Hence, $V_G$ becomes an important collective quantity\nbecause it is associated with calculation of both $\\cal {O}$ and $M_s$.\nHowever, it is practically difficult to directly get $V_G$ in real experiments.\nTo overcome this difficulty, instead of $V_G$, we employ the instantaneous\npopulation spike rate (IPSR) which can be obtained in experiments, and develop\nrealistic thermodynamic and statistical-mechanical measures, based on IPSR, to\nmake practical characterization of the neural synchronization in both\ncomputational and experimental neuroscience. Particularly, more accurate\ncharacterization of weak sparse spike synchronization can be achieved in terms\nof realistic statistical-mechanical IPSR-based measure, in comparison with the\nconventional measure based on $V_G$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2014 08:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-07"}
