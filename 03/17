It is assumed that the signals, which are modeled by general\nIt\\^{o} processes, are coupled across sensors, but that their onset times may\ndiffer from sensor to sensor. Two main cases are considered; in the first one\nsignal strengths are the same across sensors while in the second one they\ndiffer by a constant. The objective is the optimal detection of the first time\nat which any sensor in the system receives a signal. The problem is formulated\nas a stochastic optimization problem in which an extended minimal\nKullback-Leibler divergence criterion is used as a measure of detection delay,\nwith a constraint on the mean time to the first false alarm. The case in which\nthe sensors employ cumulative sum (CUSUM) strategies is considered, and it is\nproved that the minimum of $N$ CUSUMs is asymptotically optimal as the mean\ntime to the first false alarm increases without bound. In particular, in the\ncase of equal signal strengths across sensors, it is seen that the difference\nin detection delay of the $N$-CUSUM stopping rule and the unknown optimal\nstopping scheme tends to a constant related to the number of sensors as the\nmean time to the first false alarm increases without bound. Alternatively, in\nthe case of unequal signal strengths, it is seen that this difference tends to\nzero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Mar 2014 16:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-11"}

We show that in a non-spherical geometry the effects of both regimes\nmay manifest at the same time, and that it is the momentum of the outflow that\nsets the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma$ relation. Considering an initially elliptical\ndistribution of gas in the host galaxy, we show that a non-radiative outflow\nopens up a wide ``escape route'' over the paths of least resistance. Most of\nthe outflow energy escapes in that direction. At the same time, in the\ndirections of higher resistance, the ambient gas is affected mainly by the\nincident momentum from the outflow. Quenching SMBH growth requires quenching\ngas delivery along the paths of highest resistance, and therefore, it is the\nmomentum of the outflow that limits the black hole growth. We present an\nanalytical argument showing that such energy-conserving feedback bubbles\ndriving leaky ambient shells will terminate SMBH growth once its mass reaches\nroughly the $M_\\sigma$ mass derived earlier by King (2003) for\nmomentum-conserving AGN outflows. Our simulations also have potentially\nimportant implications for observations of AGN jet feedback and starburst\ngalaxy feedback. The collimation of the wide angle AGN outflow away from the\nsymmetry plane, as found in our simulations, indicates that credit for work\ndone by such outflows may sometimes be mistakenly given to AGN jets or star\nformation feedback since wide angle $v \\sim 0.1 c$ outflows are harder to\nobserve and the phase when they are present may be short.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Mar 2014 17:31:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Systems of globular clusters in\ngalaxy clusters are particularly interesting as it is in the progenitors of\ngalaxy clusters that the earliest reionizing sources first formed. Although the\nexact physical origin of globular clusters is still debated, it is generally\nadmitted that globular clusters form in early, rare dark matter peaks (Moore et\nal. 2006; Boley et al. 2009). We provide a fully numerical analysis of the\nVirgo cluster globular cluster system by identifying the present day globular\ncluster system with exactly such early, rare dark matter peaks. A popular\nhypothesis is that that the observed truncation of blue metal poor globular\ncluster formation is due to reionization (Spitler et al. 2012; Boley et al.\n2009; Brodie & Strader 2006); adopting this view, constraining the formation\nepoch of MPGCs provides a complementary constraint on the epoch of\nreionization. By analyzing both the line of sight velocity dispersion and the\nsurface density distribution of the present day distribution we are able to\nconstrain the redshift and mass of the dark matter peaks.

When $\\mathcal{R}_0 < 1$, the\ninfection-free equilibrium $E_0$ is globally asymptotically stable.

In fact, global\ndata fits for the determination of the non-perturbative parameters of\nbound-state formation traditionally exclude polarization observables and use\nthem as a posteriori verifications of the predictions, with perplexing results.\nWith a change of perspective, we move polarization data to the centre of the\nstudy, advocating that they actually provide the strongest fundamental\nindications about the production mechanisms, even before we explicitly consider\nperturbative calculations.\n  Considering psi(2S) and Y(3S) measurements from LHC experiments and\nstate-of-the-art NLO short-distance calculations in the framework of\nnon-relativistic QCD factorization (NRQCD), we perform a search for a kinematic\ndomain where the polarizations can be correctly reproduced together with the\ncross sections, by systematically scanning the phase space and accurately\ntreating the experimental uncertainties. This strategy provides a\nstraightforward solution to the \"quarkonium polarization puzzle\" and reassuring\nsigns that the theoretical framework is reliable.

In NGC253, the 12C/13C ratio\nis 40+-10. Assuming that the ratio also holds for the CO emitting gas, this\nyields 16O/18O = 145+-36 and 16O/17O = 1290+-365 and a 32S/34S ratio close to\nthat measured for the local interstellar medium (20-25). No indication for\nvibrationally excited CN is found. Peak line intensity ratios between NGC253\nand Mrk231 are ~100 for 12C16O and 12C18O J=1-0, while the ratio for 13C16O\nJ=1-0 is ~250. This and similar 13CO and C18O line intensities in the J=1-0 and\n2-1 transitions of Mrk231 suggest 12C/13C ~ 100 and 16O/18O ~ 100, in agreement\nwith values obtained for the less evolved ultraluminous merger Arp220.

With\n12C being predominantly synthesized in massive stars, while 13C is mostly\nejected by longer lived lower mass stars at later times, this is qualitatively\nconsistent with our results of decreasing carbon isotope ratios with time and\nrising metallicity.

The telescope comprised a 26 cm aperture all-cold refracting\noptical system equipped with a focal plane of 512 antenna coupled transition\nedge sensor 150 GHz bolometers each with temperature sensitivity of\n$\\approx300\\mu\\mathrm{K}_\\mathrm{CMB}\\sqrt{s}$. BICEP2 observed from the South\nPole for three seasons from 2010 to 2012. A low-foreground region of sky with\nan effective area of 380 square deg was observed to a depth of 87 nK deg in\nStokes $Q$ and $U$. We find an excess of $B$-mode power over the base\nlensed-LCDM expectation in the range $30< \\ell< 150$, inconsistent with the\nnull hypothesis at a significance of $> 5\\sigma$. Through jackknife tests and\nsimulations we show that systematic contamination is much smaller than the\nobserved excess.

We consider frame-based transmissions.\nEach frame is divided into three phases: the uplink channel estimation (CE)\nphase, the downlink WET phase, as well as the uplink wireless information\ntransmission (WIT) phase. Firstly, users use a fraction of the previously\nharvested energy to send pilots, while the H-AP estimates the uplink channels\nand obtains the downlink channels by exploiting channel reciprocity. Next, the\nH-AP utilizes the channel estimates just obtained to transfer wireless energy\nto all users in the downlink via energy beamforming. Finally, the users use a\nportion of the harvested energy to send data to the H-AP simultaneously in the\nuplink (reserving some harvested energy for sending pilots in the next frame).\nTo optimize the throughput and ensure rate fairness, we consider the problem of\nmaximizing the minimum rate among all users.

Case 1 is the emergence of a single flux tube, which is\nsplit into two in the convection zone and emerges at two locations, while Case\n2 is the emergence of two isolated but neighboring tubes. We find that, in Case\n1, a sheared PIL and a coronal arcade are created in the middle of the region,\nwhich agrees with the AR 11158 observation.

In this paper, the transmission capability of a\nbuffer-aided block Rayleigh fading channel is examined by a constant rate input\ndata stream, and reflected by several parameters such as the average queue\nlength, stationary queue length distribution, packet delay and overflow\nprobability.

Such heterogeneity typically arises in\nwireless networks (e.g., servers may represent frequency bands, and the service\nrate of a user varies across bands). Users select servers in a distributed\nmanner. They initially attach to an arbitrary server. However, at random\ninstants of time, they may probe the load at a new server and migrate there to\nimprove their service rate. We analyze the system dynamics under the natural\nRandom Local Search (RLS) migration scheme, introduced in \\cite{sig10}. Under\nthis scheme, when a user has the opportunity to switch servers, she does it\nonly if this improves her service rate. The dynamics under RLS may be\ninterpreted as those generated by strategic players updating their strategy in\na load balancing game. In closed systems, where the user population is fixed,\nwe show that this game has pure Nash Equilibriums (NEs), and we analyze their\nefficiency. We further prove that when the user population grows large, pure\nNEs get closer to a Proportionally Fair (PF) allocation of users to servers,\nand we characterize the gap between equilibriums and this ideal allocation\ndepending on user population. Under the RLS algorithm, the system converges to\npure NEs: we study the time it takes for the system to reach the PF allocation\nwithin a certain margin. In open systems, where users randomly enter the system\nand leave upon service completion, we establish that the RLS algorithm\nstabilizes the system whenever this it at all possible, i.e., it is\nthroughput-optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 11:51:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Dec 2014 20:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-09"}

It was also unusual in that its late-time\nX-ray emission observed by Swift was very soft, and showed a strong\nhard-to-soft spectral evolution with time. This evolution, rarely seen in GRB\nafterglows, can be well modelled as the dust-scattered echo of the prompt\nemission, with stringent limits on the contribution from the normal afterglow\n(i.e. external shock) emission.

We consider whether the mid infrared (MIR)\nproperties of ETGs, with their sensitivity to accretion processes in particular\nin the last few Gyr (on average z < 0.2), can put further constraints on this\npicture. We investigate a sample of 49 ETGs for which nuclear MIR properties\nand detailed photometrical and kinematical classifications are available from\nthe recent literature. In the stellar light cuspy/core ETGs show a dichotomy\nthat is mainly driven by their luminosity. However in the MIR, the brightest\ncore ETGs show evidence that accretions have triggered both AGN and star\nformation activity in the recent past, challenging a \"dry\" merger scenario. In\ncontrast, we do find, in the Virgo and Fornax clusters, that cuspy ETGs,\nfainter than M$_{K_s}=-24$, are predominantly passively evolving in the same\nepoch, while, in low density environments, they tend to be more active. A\nsignificant and statistically similar fraction of both FR (38$^{+18}_{-11}$\\%)\nand SR (50$^{+34}_{-21}$\\%) shows PAH features in their MIR spectra.

New experiments not only use HTS\nto measure genomic features at one time point but to monitor them changing over\ntime with the aim of identifying significant changes in their abundance. In\npopulation genetics, for example, allele frequencies are monitored over time to\ndetect significant frequency changes that indicate selection pressures.\nPrevious attempts at analysing data from HTS experiments have been limited as\nthey could not simultaneously include data at intermediate time points,\nreplicate experiments and sources of uncertainty specific to HTS such as\nsequencing depth.\n  Results: We present the beta-binomial Gaussian process (BBGP) model for\nranking features with significant non-random variation in abundance over time.\nThe features are assumed to represent proportions, such as proportion of an\nalternative allele in a population. We use the beta-binomial model to capture\nthe uncertainty arising from finite sequencing depth and combine it with a\nGaussian process model over the time series. In simulations that mimic the\nfeatures of experimental evolution data, the proposed method clearly\noutperforms classical testing in average precision of finding selected alleles.\nWe also present simulations exploring different experimental design choices and\nresults on real data from Drosophila experimental evolution experiment in\ntemperature adaptation.\n  Availability: R software implementing the test is available at\nhttps://github.com/handetopa/BBGP\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 13:08:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Mar 2014 14:14:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Sep 2014 07:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-09-19"}

Here we\npresent a study of H{\\alpha} variability in 15 T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars\n(K7-B2) over a wide range of time windows, from minutes, to hours, to days, and\nyears. We assess the variability using linewidth measurements and the time\nseries of line profiles. All objects show gradual, slow profile changes on\ntime-scales of days. In addition, in three cases there is evidence for rapid\nvariations in H{\\alpha} with typical time-scales of 10 min, which occurs in 10%\nof the total covered observing time. The mean accretion-rate changes, inferred\nfrom the line fluxes,are 0.01-0.07 dex for time-scales of < 1 hour, 0.04-0.4\ndex for time-scales of days, and 0.13-0.52 dex for time-scales of years.\n  In Costigan et al. 2012 we derived an upper limit finding that the\nintermediate (days) variability dominated over longer (years) variability. Here\nour new results, based on much higher cadence observations, also provide a\nlower limit to accretion-rate variability on similar time-scales (days),\nthereby constraining the accretion rate variability physics in a much more\ndefinitive way. A plausible explanation for the gradual variations over days is\nan asymmetric accretion flow resulting in a rotational modulation of the\naccretion-related emission, although other interpretations are possible as\nwell. In conjunction with our previous work, we find that the time-scales and\nthe extent of the variability is similar for objects ranging in mass from ~ 0.1\nto ~ 5 Msol.

Their neutrino spectrum has a\ncutoff feature around PeV energies since target photons are due to Ly$\\alpha$\nemission. Because of infrared photons provided by the dust torus, neutrino\nspectra above PeV energies are too hard to be consistent with the IceCube data\nunless the proton spectral index is steeper than 2.5, or the maximum proton\nenergy is $\\lesssim100$ PeV.

We used\nthe Spitzer InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) photometry obtained in the 3.6-8\nmicron range of a carefully chosen sample of 15 Galactic globular clusters\nspanning the entire metallicity range and sampling the vast zoology of\nhorizontal branch (HB) morphologies. We complemented the IRAC photometry with\nnear-infrared data to build suitable color-magnitude and color-color diagrams\nand identify mass-losing giant stars. We find that while the majority of stars\nshow colors typical of cool giants, some stars show an excess of mid-infrared\nlight that is larger than expected from their photospheric emission and that is\nplausibly due to dust formation in mass flowing from them. For these stars, we\nestimate dust and total (gas + dust) ML rates and timescales. We finally\ncalibrate an empirical ML law for Population II red and asymptotic giant branch\nstars with varying metallicity. We find that at a given red giant branch\nluminosity only a fraction of the stars are losing mass. From this, we conclude\nthat ML is episodic and is active only a fraction of the time, which we define\nas the duty cycle. The fraction of mass-losing stars increases by increasing\nthe stellar luminosity and metallicity. The ML rate, as estimated from\nreasonable assumptions for the gas-to-dust ratio and expansion velocity,\ndepends on metallicity and slowly increases with decreasing metallicity. In\ncontrast, the duty cycle increases with increasing metallicity, with the net\nresult that total ML increases moderately with increasing metallicity, about\n0.1 Msun every dex in [Fe/H]. For Population II asymptotic giant branch stars,\nwe estimate a total ML of <0.1 Msun, nearly constant with varying metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 13:55:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Stellar wind\nmass loss is one of the dominant processes determining the evolution of massive\nstars, and it may provide clues on the evolutionary properties of blue\nsupergiants. As the H$\\alpha$ line is the most oft-used mass-loss tracer in the\nOB-star regime, we provide a detailed analysis of the H$\\alpha$ line for OB\nsupergiant models over an $T_{\\rm eff}$ range between 30000 and 12500K. We find\na maximum in the H$\\alpha$ equivalent width at 22500 K - at the location of the\nbi-stability jump. The H$\\alpha$ line-profile behaviour is characterised by two\nbranches of $T_{\\rm eff}$: (i) a \"hot\" branch between 30000 and 22500 K, where\nH$\\alpha$ emission becomes stronger with decreasing $T_{\\rm eff}$, and (ii) a\n\"cool\" branch between 22500 and 12500 K, where the line becomes weaker. Our\nmodels show that this non-monotonic H$\\alpha$ behaviour is related to the\noptical depth of Ly$\\alpha$, finding that at the \"cool\" branch the population\nof the 2nd level of hydrogen is enhanced in comparison to the 3rd level. This\nis expected to increase line absorption, leading to weaker H$\\alpha$ flux when\n$T_{\\rm eff}$ drops from 22500 K downwards.

The principle of this method is to\nuse a functional basis with elements that already include these fine structure\nso as to avoid these extra costs.

Since the patches are doubly bondable, associated chains, of all chain\nlengths, as well as 4-mer rings consisting of two species A and two species B\ncolloids are accounted for. With the restriction of only AB attractions,\ntriatomic rings of doubly bonded colloids, which dominate the corresponding\npure component case, cannot form.

Towards the embedding\nprocess, several graph theoretic watermarking algorithmic techniques encode the\nwatermark values as graph structures and embed them in application programs.\nRecently, we presented an efficient codec system for encoding a watermark\nnumber $w$ as a reducible permutation graph $F[\\pi^*]$ through the use of\nself-inverting permutations $\\pi^*$. In this paper, we propose a dynamic\nwatermarking model, which we call WaterRPG, for embedding the watermark graph\n$F[\\pi^*]$ into an application program $P$. The main idea behind the proposed\nwatermarking model is a systematic use of appropriate calls of specific\nfunctions of the program $P$. More precisely, for a specific input $I_{key}$ of\nthe program $P$, our model takes the dynamic call-graph $G(P, I_{key})$ of $P$\nand the watermark graph $F[\\pi^*]$, and produces the watermarked program $P^*$\nhaving the following key property: its dynamic call-graph $G(P^*, I_{key})$ is\nisomorphic to the watermark graph $F[\\pi^*]$. Within this idea the program\n$P^*$ is produced by only altering appropriate calls of specific functions of\nthe input application program $P$. We have implemented our watermarking model\nWaterRPG in real application programs and evaluated its functionality under\nvarious and broadly used watermarking assessment criteria. The evaluation\nresults show that our model efficiently watermarks Java application programs\nwith respect to several watermarking metrics like data-rate, bytecode\ninstructions overhead, resiliency, time and space efficiency. Moreover, the\nembedded watermarks withstand several software obfuscation and optimization\nattacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2014 11:31:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-27"}
