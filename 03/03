The Chen-Shibata (2000) model, which\naddresses the connection between emerging flux and flux rope eruptions, can be\nimplemented numerically to study how emerging flux through the photosphere can\nimpact the eruption of a pre-existing coronal flux rope. The model's\nsensitivity to the initial conditions and reconnection micro-physics is\ninvestigated with a parameter study. In particular, we aim to understand the\nstability of the coronal flux rope in the context of X-point collapse and the\neffects of boundary driving in both unstratified and stratified atmospheres. In\nthe absence of driving, we assess the behavior of waves in the vicinity of the\nX-point. With boundary driving applied, we study the effects of reconnection\nmicro-physics and atmospheric stratification on the eruption. We find that the\nChen-Shibata equilibrium can be unstable to an X-point collapse even in the\nabsence of driving due to wave accumulation at the X-point. However, the\nequilibrium can be stabilized by reducing the compressibility of the plasma,\nwhich allows small-amplitude waves to pass through the X-point without\naccumulation. Simulations with the photospheric boundary driving evaluate the\nimpact of reconnection micro-physics and atmospheric stratification on the\nresulting dynamics: we show the evolution of the system to be determined\nprimarily by the structure of the global magnetic fields with little\nsensitivity to the micro-physics of magnetic reconnection; and in a stratified\natmosphere, we identify a novel mechanism for producing quasi-periodic behavior\nat the reconnection site behind a rising flux rope as a possible explanation of\nsimilar phenomena observed in solar and stellar flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Mar 2014 16:26:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Aug 2014 13:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-01"}

Bayesian inference\nprovides a principled way for regularizing the problem using prior knowledge. A\nfundamental choice is how one measures \"distances\" between shapes in an image.\nIt has been shown that the straightforward geometric L2 distance is degenerate\nand leads to pathological situations. This is avoided when using Sobolev\ngradients, rendering the segmentation problem less ill-posed. The high\ncomputational cost and implementation overhead of Sobolev gradients, however,\nhave hampered practical applications. We show how particle methods as applied\nto image segmentation allow for a simple and computationally efficient\nimplementation of Sobolev gradients. We show that the evaluation of Sobolev\ngradients amounts to particle-particle interactions along the contour in an\nimage. We extend an existing particle-based segmentation algorithm to using\nSobolev gradients. Using synthetic and real-world images, we benchmark the\nresults for both 2D and 3D images using piecewise smooth and piecewise constant\nregion models. The present particle approximation of Sobolev gradients is 2.8\nto 10 times faster than the previous reference implementation, but retains the\nknown favorable properties of Sobolev gradients. This speedup is achieved by\nusing local particle-particle interactions instead of solving a global Poisson\nequation at each iteration. The computational time per iteration is higher for\nSobolev gradients than for L2 gradients. Since Sobolev gradients precondition\nthe optimization problem, however, a smaller number of overall iterations may\nbe necessary for the algorithm to converge, which can in some cases amortize\nthe higher per-iteration cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Mar 2014 16:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-04"}

Contrary to it, we find that the RM of\nat least ~10 rad/m/m could be detected with the SKA or its\npathfinders/precursors, if we achieve selections of ideal sources.

According to the calibration\nformulae, the corrections for W1 at 5 mag and W2 at 4 mag are $-0.383$ and\n0.217 mag, respectively. In total, we calibrated the W1/W2 magnitudes of\n2390/2021 AGB stars. The model parameters from the DUSTY and the calibrated\nWISE W1 and W2 magnitudes are used to discuss the behavior of the WISE\ncolor-color diagrams of AGB stars. The model parameters also reveal that O-rich\nAGB stars with opaque circumstellar envelopes are much rarer than opaque C-rich\nAGB stars toward the anti-Galactic center direction, which we attribute to the\nmetallicity gradient of our Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2014 08:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-08"}

For the special case of m = 1, the addressed\nscheduling problem is equivalent to relay selection for the scenario with one\nSD pair and M relays. In conventional cooperative networks, the max-min\nselection criterion has been recognized as a diversity-optimal strategy for\nrelay selection and user scheduling. The main contribution of this paper is to\nshow that the use of the max-min criterion will result in loss of diversity\ngains in energy harvesting cooperative networks. Particularly when only a\nsingle user is scheduled, analytical results are developed to demonstrate that\nthe diversity gain achieved by the max-min criterion is only (M+1)/2, much less\nthan the maximal diversity gain M. The max-min criterion suffers this diversity\nloss because it does not reflect the fact that the source-relay channels are\nmore important than the relay-destination channels in energy harvesting\nnetworks. Motivated by this fact, a few user scheduling approaches tailored to\nenergy harvesting networks are developed and their performance is analyzed.\nSimulation results are provided to demonstrate the accuracy of the developed\nanalytical results and facilitate the performance comparison.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2014 09:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-04"}

An interference power constraint (IPC)\nis imposed on the SN to protect the PU. Under such a constraint and the\nindividual transmit power constraint (TPC) imposed on each SU, we investigate\nthe power allocation strategies to maximize the ergodic sum-rate of a fading\nC-MAC without successive interference cancellation (SIC). In particular, this\npaper considers two types of constraints: (1) average TPC and average IPC, (2)\npeak TPC and peak IPC. For the first case, it is proved that the optimal power\nallocation is dynamic time-division multiple-access (D-TDMA), which is exactly\nthe same as the optimal power allocation to maximize the ergodic sum-rate of\nthe fading C-MAC with SIC under the same constraints. For the second case, it\nis proved that the optimal solution must be at the extreme points of the\nfeasible region.

In the Euclidean path\nintegral formalism, this amounts to compute the expectation value of the\noff-diagonal components T_{0k} of the energy-momentum tensor in presence of\nshifted boundary conditions. The entropy is thus easily measured from the\nexpectation value of a local observable computed at the target temperature T\nonly. At large T, the temperature itself is the only scale which drives the\nsystematic errors, and the lattice spacing can be tuned to perform a reliable\ncontinuum limit extrapolation while keeping finite-size effects under control.\nWe test this strategy for the four-dimensional SU(3) Yang-Mills theory. We\npresent precise results for the entropy density and its step-scaling function\nin the temperature range 0.9 T_c - 20 T_c. At each temperature, we consider\nfour lattice spacings in order to extrapolate the results to the continuum\nlimit.

By means\nof an applied electric field, the gas is partially ionized by the electron\navalanche process. In order for the electron temperature to increase, the\nremaining neutrals need to be fully ionized in the plasma burn-through phase,\nas radiation is the main contribution to the electron power loss. The radiated\npower loss can be significantly affected by impurities resulting from\ninteraction with the plasma facing components. The DYON code is a plasma\nburn-through simulator developed at Joint European Torus (JET) [1] [2]. The\ndynamic evolution of the plasma temperature and plasma densities including\nimpurity content is calculated in a self-consistent way, using plasma wall\ninteraction models. The recent installation of a beryllium wall at JET enabled\nvalidation of the plasma burn-through model in the presence of new, metallic\nplasma facing components. The simulation results of the plasma burn-through\nphase show consistent good agreement against experiments at JET, and explain\ndifferences observed during plasma initiation with the old carbon plasma facing\ncomponents. In the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), the\nallowable toroidal electric field is restricted to 0.35 [V/m], which is\nsignificantly lower compared to the typical value (~ 1 [V/m]) used in the\npresent devices. The limitation on toroidal electric field also reduces the\nrange of other operation parameters during plasma formation in ITER. Thus,\npredictive simulations of plasma burn-through in ITER using validated model is\nof crucial importance. This paper provides an overview of the DYON code and the\nvalidation, together with new predictive simulations for ITER using the DYON\ncode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2014 10:48:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Mar 2014 10:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-03-05"}

The triggering mechanism\nappears to be episodic jets connecting the energetic event with the filament\nthreads. In the present work we analyze this periodic motion in a large\nfraction of the filament to characterize the underlying physics of the\noscillation as well as the filament properties. The results support our\nprevious theoretical conclusions that the restoring force of large-amplitude\nlongitudinal oscillations is solar gravity, and the damping mechanism is the\nongoing accumulation of mass onto the oscillating threads. Based on our\nprevious work, we used the fitted parameters to determine the magnitude and\nradius of curvature of the dipped magnetic field along the filament, as well as\nthe mass accretion rate onto the filament threads. These derived properties are\nnearly uniform along the filament, indicating a remarkable degree of\ncohesiveness throughout the filament channel. Moreover, the estimated mass\naccretion rate implies that the footpoint heating responsible for the thread\nformation, according to the thermal nonequilibrium model, agrees with previous\ncoronal heating estimates. We estimate the magnitude of the energy released in\nthe nearby event by studying the dynamic response of the filament threads, and\ndiscuss the implications of our study for filament structure and heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2014 10:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}

The\ncentral spin decoherence approach, however, is feasible only in some special\nconfigurations and often requires uniform coupling between the central spin and\nindividual spins in the baths, which are very challenging in experiments. Here,\nby making analogue between central spin decoherence and depolarization of\nphotons, we propose a scheme of Faraday rotation echo spectroscopy (FRES) for\nstudying quantum fluctuations in interacting spin systems. The echo control of\nthe photon polarization is realized by flipping the polarization with a\nbirefringence crystal.

We apply the scheme to a\nrare-earth compound LiHoF4 and calculate the echo signal, which is related to\nthe quantum fluctuations of the system. We observe enhanced signals at the\nphase boundary.

We consider the supersymmetric QED model extended by an\narbitrary polynomial potential of massive vector superfield that breaks gauge\ninvariance in the SUSY invariant phase. However, the requirement of vacuum\nstability in such class of models makes both supersymmetry and Lorentz\ninvariance to become spontaneously broken. As a consequence, massless photino\nand photon appear as the corresponding Nambu-Goldstone zero modes in an\nemergent SUSY QED, and also a special gauge invariance is simultaneously\ngenerated. Due to this invariance all observable relativistically noninvariant\neffects appear to be completely cancelled out among themselves and physical\nLorentz invariance is recovered. Nevertheless, such theories may have an\ninevitable observational evidence in terms of the goldstino-photino like state\npresented in the low-energy particle spectrum.

Observations of the PDF of molecular clouds\nindicate a composition of a broad distribution around the maximum and a\ndecreasing tail at high mass surface densities. The first component is\nattributed to the random distribution of gas which is modeled using a\nlog-normal function while the second component is attributed to condensed\nstructures modeled using a simple power-law. The aim of this paper is to\nprovide an analytical model of the PDF of condensed structures which can be\nused by observers to extract information about the condensations. The condensed\nstructures are considered to be either spheres or cylinders with a truncated\nradial density profile at cloud radius r_cl. The assumed profile is of the form\nrho(r)=rho_c/(1+(r/r_0)^2)^{n/2} for arbitrary power n where rho_c and r_0 are\nthe central density and the inner radius, respectively. An implicit function is\nobtained which either truncates (sphere) or has a pole (cylinder) at maximal\nmass surface density. The PDF of spherical condensations and the asymptotic PDF\nof cylinders in the limit of infinite overdensity rho_c/rho(r_cl) flattens for\nsteeper density profiles and has a power law asymptote at low and high mass\nsurface densities and a well defined maximum. The power index of the asymptote\nSigma^(-gamma) of the logarithmic PDF (Sigma x P(Sigma)) in the limit of high\nmass surface densities is given by gamma = (n+1)/(n-1)-1 (spheres) or by\ngamma=n/(n-1)-1 (cylinders in the limit of infinite overdensity).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Mar 2014 14:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-18"}
