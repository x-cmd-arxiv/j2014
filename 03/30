Comparison with corresponding\nanalyses of B(E1) strength distributions from microscopic model calculations in\nthe framework of the QPM and relativistic RPA allow to identify giant resonance\ndecay mechanisms responsible for the fine structure. The level density of 1-\nstates can be related to local fluctuations of the cross sections in the energy\nregion of the IVGDR.

The background induces different dispersion\nrelations, hence populations, between fermions and antifermions, and thus CPT\nViolation (CPTV) already in thermal equilibrium.

More specifically, after\nreviewing some generic models of background-induced CPTV in early epochs of the\nUniverse, we consider a string-inspired scenario, in which the CPTV is\nassociated with a cosmological background with torsion provided by the\nKalb-Ramond (KR) antisymemtric tensor field of the string gravitational\nmultiplet. In a four-dimensional space time this field is dual to a\npseudoscalar ``axion-like'' field.

These processes freeze out at a\n(high) temperature $T_c >> m$, where $m$ is the Majorana neutrino mass, at\nwhich the KR background goes to zero or is diminished significantly, through\nappropriate phase transitions of the (string) universe. An additional, but\nequally important, r\\^ole, of the KR field is that its quantum fluctuations and\nmixing with an ordinary axion, which couples to the Majorana neutrinos via\nappropriate Yukawa couplings, can also lead to the generation of a Majorana\nneutrino mass through quantum anomalies.

Particularly, this is important for the Fast\nMultipole Methods in three dimensions for the Helmholtz, Laplace and related\nequations, if rotation-based decomposition of translation operators are used.\nIn these and related problems related to representation of functions on a\nsphere via spherical harmonic expansions computation of the rotation\ncoefficients of large degree $n$ (of the order of thousands and more) may be\nnecessary. Existing algorithms for their computation, based on recursions, are\nusually unstable, and do not extend to $n$. We develop a new recursion and\nstudy its behavior for large degrees, via computational and asymptotic\nanalyses. Stability of this recursion was studied based on a novel application\nof the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition and the von Neumann method for\nstability of finite-difference schemes for solution of PDEs. A recursive\nalgorithm of minimal complexity $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ for degree $n$ and\nFFT-based algorithms of complexity $O\\left(n^{2}\\log n\\right) $ suitable for\ncomputation of rotation coefficients of large degrees are proposed, studied\nnumerically, and cross-validated. It is shown that the latter algorithm can be\nused for $n\\lesssim 10^{3}$ in double precision, while the former algorithm was\ntested for large $n$ (up to $10^{4}$ in our experiments) and demonstrated\nbetter performance and accuracy compared to the FFT-based algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Mar 2014 04:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-01"}

In this paper, we present the observations of a chain of winking\nfilaments and a subsequent jet that are observed right after the X2.1 are in\nAR11283. The event also produced an Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave that has two\ncomponents: upward dome-like wave (850 km/s) and lateral surface wave (554\nkm/s) which was very weak (or invisible) in imaging observations. By analyzing\nthe temporal and spatial relationships between the oscillating filaments and\nthe EUV waves, we propose that all the winking filaments and the jet were\ntriggered by the weak (or invisible) lateral surface EUV wave. The oscillation\nof the filaments last for two or three cycles, and their periods, Doppler\nvelocity amplitudes, and damping times are 11 - 22 minutes, 6 - 14 km/s, and 25\n- 60 minutes, respectively. We further estimate the radial component magnetic\nfield and the maximum kinetic energy of the filaments, and they are 5 - 10\nGauss and ~ 10^19 J, respectively. The estimated maximum kinetic energy is\ncomparable to the minimum energy of ordinary EUV waves, suggesting that EUV\nwaves can efficiently launch filament oscillations on their path. Based on our\nanalysis results, we conclude that the EUV wave is a good agent for triggering\nand connecting successive but separated solar activities in the solar\natmosphere, and it is also important for producing solar sympathetic eruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Mar 2014 06:22:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-19"}

Scheduling in such systems is also subject to stringent\nconstraints such as power and bandwidth, which limit the maximum number of\nsimultaneous transmissions. In the meanwhile, communication channels in\nwireless systems typically fluctuate in a time-correlated manner. We hence\ndesign schedulers to exploit the temporal-correlation inherent in channels with\nmemory and ARQ-styled feedback from the users for better channel state\nknowledge, under the assumption of Markovian channels and the stringent\nconstraint on the maximum number of simultaneously active users. We model this\nproblem under the framework of a Partially Observable Markov Decision\nProcesses.\n  In recent work, a low-complexity optimal solution was developed for this\nproblem under a long-term time-average resource constraint. However, in real\nsystems with instantaneous resource constraints, how to optimally exploit the\ntemporal correlation and satisfy realistic stringent constraint on the\ninstantaneous service remains elusive. In this work, we incorporate a stringent\nconstraint on the simultaneously scheduled users and propose a low-complexity\nscheduling algorithm that dynamically implements user scheduling and dummy\npacket broadcasting. We show that the throughput region of the optimal policy\nunder the long-term average resource constraint can be asymptotically achieved\nin the stringent constrained scenario by the proposed algorithm, in the many\nusers limiting regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Mar 2014 15:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-04-01"}

We also discuss the modified version of the\ntheorem that is always valid. Then we present a simple and exactly workable\nexample of an electromagnetic interacting system which illustrates the\nviolation of those standard versions of the center of mass motion theorem. We\nshow that for this system Minkowski's density of linear momentum which yields a\nnon-symmetric electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor, but not Abraham's, is\ncompatible with total momentum conservation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Mar 2014 04:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}

A dual-band\nleft-handed feature was observed in the frequency bands of 1.5 to 5.5 GHz and 9\nto 17 GHz, indicated by two transmission windows associated with ferromagnetic\nresonance of Fe-based microwires and long range dipolar resonance between the\nwire arrays. The plasma frequency after hybridization is significantly\nincreased due to the enhanced effective diameter through the wire-wire\ninteractions between the Fe- and Co- microwire couples. These results offer\nessential perspectives in designing the multi-band metamaterial for microwave\napplications such as sensors and cloaking devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Mar 2014 13:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-05"}

Accessing and searching massive academic\npublications that are distributed over several locations need large amount of\ncomputing resources to increase the system performance. Therefore, many\ngrid-based search techniques were proposed to provide flexible methods for\nsearching the distributed extensive data. This paper proposes search technique\nthat is capable of searching the extensive publications by utilizing grid\ncomputing technology. The search technique is implemented as interconnected\ngrid services to offer a mechanism to access different data locations. The\nexperimental result shows that the grid-based search technique has enhanced the\nperformance of the search.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Mar 2014 13:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}
