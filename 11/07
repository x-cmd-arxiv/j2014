Rapid rotation complicates modelling because fundamental\nproperties like the stellar luminosity and effective temperature require\nknowledge of the angle of inclina- tion at which the star is observed.\nFurthermore our knowledge of the structure of rapidly rotating stars is on a\nless sure foundation than for non-rotating stars. The uncertainties in the\ninclination and the surface properties of a few rapidly rotating stars have\nbeen substantially reduced by interferometric observations over the last\ndecade, and these stars can be used as tests of rotating stellar models, even\nif those stars themselves may not be Be stars. Vega, as an MK standard, is\nhistorically a very important star because it is used for calibration purposes.\nHowever, several studies have suggested that Vega is a rapidly rotating star\nviewed at a very low inclination angle, raising questions as to how well we\nreally know its properties. Appropriate modelling has been challenging and\nthere is still room for debate over the actual properties of Vega, as opposed\nto its observed properties. We have previously shown that under certain\nconditions both the stellar surface properties and the deduced surface\nproperties scale from one model to another with the same surface shape.

This simple idea underlies the mathematics of Cartan\ngeometry. The Cartan-geometric description of gravity consists of a SO(1,4)\ngauge connection $A^{AB}(x)$ and a symmetry-breaking field $V^A(x)$. The clear\nsimilarity with symmetry-broken Yang-Mills theory suggests strongly the\nexistence of a new field in nature: the gravitational Higgs field $V^A$. By\ntreating $V^A$ as a genuine dynamical field we arrive at a natural\ngeneralization of General Relativity with a wealth of new phenomenology and\nwith General Relativity reproduced exactly in the limit where $V^2$ tends to a\npositive constant. We show that in regions wherein $V^2(x)$ varies, but has a\ndefinite sign, the Cartan-geometric formulation is a form of a scalar-tensor\ntheory. A specific choice of action yields the Peebles-Ratra quintessence model\nwhilst more general actions are shown to exhibit propagation of torsion.\nRegions where the sign of $V^2$ changes correspond to a change in signature of\nthe geometry; a simple choice of action with FRW symmetry yields, without any\nadditional ad hoc assumptions, a classical analogue of the Hartle-Hawking\nno-boundary proposal. Solutions from more general actions are discussed. A\ngauge prescription for coupling matter to gravity is described and matter\nactions are presented which reduce to standard ones in the limit\n$V^2\\rightarrow const$. It becomes clear that Cartan geometry may function as a\nnovel platform for inspiring and exploring modified theories of gravity with\napplications to dark energy, black holes, and early-universe cosmology.

As a consequence, they\nshould be considered with caution. Using the analogy with condensed matter\nsystems, their analogue versions could be tested in the lab. Moreover, the high\nenergy behavior of these systems is known and involves dispersion and\ndissipation, which regulate the theory at short distances. When considering\nexperiments which aim to test the above predictions, there will also be a\ncompetition between the stimulated emission from thermal noise and the\nspontaneous emission out of vacuum. In order to measure these effects, one\nshould thus compute the consequences of UV dispersion and dissipation, and\nidentify observables able to establish that the spontaneous emission took\nplace.

Using\ngroup-theoretical methods, we derive an invariant expansion of the Hamiltonian\nfor electron states near the K point of the Brillouin zone. In contrast to\nknown materials, including single-layer graphene, any possible coupling of\nphysical quantities to components of the external electric (magnetic) field has\na counterpart where the analogous component of the magnetic (electric) field\ncouples to exactly the same combination of quantities. For example, a purely\nelectric spin splitting appears as the magneto-electric analogue of the\nfamiliar magnetic Zeeman spin splitting. The measurable thermodynamic response\ninduced by magnetic and electric fields is thus completely symmetric. The Pauli\nmagnetization induced by a magnetic field takes exactly the same functional\nform as the polarization induced by an electric field. Our findings thus reveal\nunconventional behavior of spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom in their\ncoupling to external fields. We explain how these counterintuitive couplings\nare consistent with fundamental principles such as time reversal symmetry. For\nexample, only a magnetic field can give rise to a macroscopic spin\npolarization, whereas only a perpendicular electric field can induce a\nmacroscopic polarization of the sublattice-related pseudospin degree of freedom\ncharacterizing the intravalley orbital motion in bilayer graphene. These rules\nenforced by symmetry for the matter-field interactions clarify the nature of\nspins versus pseudospins. We also provide numerical values of prefactors for\nrelevant coupling terms.

The study of giant planets'\ncomposition is important for understanding both the mechanisms enabling their\nformation and the origins of planetary systems, in particular our own.\nUnfortunately, its determination is complicated by the fact that their interior\nis thought not to be homogeneous, so that spectroscopic determinations of\natmospheric abundances are probably not representative of the planet as a\nwhole. Instead, the determination of their composition and structure must rely\non indirect measurements and interior models. Giant planets are mostly fluid\nand convective, which makes their seismology much closer to that of solar-like\nstars than that of terrestrial planets. Hence, helioseismology techniques\nnaturally transfer to giant planets. In addition, two alternative methods can\nbe used: photometry of the solar light reflected by planetary atmospheres, and\nring seismology in the specific case of Saturn.

Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to\na particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many\ndatasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to\nspecific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been\nstudied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality\nversus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively\naffected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons\nto their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which\nwas expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks\nbetween co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network\ntrained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may\ndominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom,\nmiddle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of\nfeatures decreases as the distance between the base task and target task\nincreases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better\nthan using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a\nnetwork with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce\na boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 23:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-09"}

The upgraded Inner Tracking System will have\nsignificantly improved tracking and vertexing capabilities, as well as readout\nrate to cope with the expected increased Pb-Pb luminosity of the LHC. The\nchoice of Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors has been driven by the specific\nrequirements of ALICE as a heavy ion experiment dealing with rare processes at\nlow transverse momenta.

The direction of the magnetic field\njust behind the tip rim is almost perpendicular to that of the incident UV\nradiation, and the magnetic field configuration appears to be symmetric as a\nwhole with respect to the cloud symmetry axis.

Second, to study the effect of not using feedback, by comparing\nfeedback-free schemes with idealistic full-feedback schemes.

The\nmodelling suggests that disks around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs are\ngenerally flatter than their higher mass counterparts, but the range of disk\nmass extends to well below the value found in T Tauri stars, and the disk scale\nheights are comparable in both groups. The inferred disk properties (i.e., disk\nmass, flaring, and scale height) in the low stellar mass regime are consistent\nwith previous findings from large samples of brown dwarfs and very low-mass\nstars. We discuss the dependence of disk properties on their host stellar\nparameters and find a significant correlation between the Herschel far-IR\nfluxes and the stellar effective temperatures, probably indicating that the\nscaling between the stellar and disk masses (i.e., $M_{\\rm{disk}} \\propto\nM_{\\star}$) observed mainly in low-mass stars may extend down to the brown\ndwarf regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 08:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-24"}

This amplification potential is best captured by optimal\ntransient growth analysis, optimal harmonic forcing, or the response to\nsustained noise. In view of reducing disturbance amplification in these\nglobally stable open flows, a variational technique is proposed to evaluate the\nsensitivity of stochastic amplification to steady control. Existing sensitivity\nmethods are extended in two ways to achieve a realistic representation of\nincoming noise: (i) perturbations are time-stochastic rather than\ntime-harmonic, (ii) perturbations are localised at the inlet rather than\ndistributed in space. This allows for the identification of regions where\nsmall-amplitude control is the most effective, without actually computing any\ncontrolled flows. In particular, passive control by means of a small cylinder\nand active control by means of wall blowing/suction are analysed for Reynolds\nnumber $Re=500$ and step-to-outlet expansion ratio $\\Gamma=0.5$. Sensitivity\nmaps for noise amplification appear largely similar to sensitivity maps for\noptimal harmonic amplification at the most amplified frequency. This is\nobserved at other values of $Re$ and $\\Gamma$ too, and suggests that the design\nof steady control in this noise amplifier flow can be simplified by focusing on\nthe most dangerous perturbation at the most dangerous frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 09:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-05"}

There are mainly three morphologic\ntypes of dwarf galaxies: dwarf ellipticals, dwarf spheroidals and dwarf\nirregulars. Dwarf irregular galaxies are particularly interesting in dwarf\ngalaxy evolution, since dwarf spheroidal predecessors could have been very\nsimilar to them. Therefore, a mechanism linked to gas-loss in dwarf irregulars\nshould be observed, i.e. ram pressure stripping. In this paper, we study the\ninteraction between the ISM of a dwarf galaxy, and a flowing IGM. We derive the\nweak-shock, plasmon solution corresponding to the balance between the post-bow\nshock pressure and the pressure of the stratified ISM (which we assume follows\nthe fixed stratification of a gravitationally dominant dark matter halo). We\ncompare our model with previously published numerical simulations and with the\nobserved shape of the HI cloud around the Ho II and Pegasus dwarf irregular\ngalaxies. We show that such a comparison provides a straightforward way for\nestimating the Mach number of the impinging flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 10:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-10"}

Also,\nthe self-diffusion of the tracers becomes suppressed upon increasing the\ndensity of the systems. These phenomena are attributed to an underlying\npercolation transition.

Method: We conducted a\nsystematic review about the state of art of the agile governance up to and\nincluding 2013.

To prove, experiments\nwere conducted on a rack aware cluster setup which significantly reduced the\ntask completion time, but once the volume of the data being processed increases\nthere is a considerable cutback in computational speeds due to update cost.\nFurther the threshold level for balance between the update cost and replication\nfactor is identified and presented graphically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 14:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-10"}

The main result is that there exists a particular value of the\nforce constant, corresponding to a mean slab depth approximately equal to a few\ntimes the Kolmogorov length scale, that maximizes the clustering of the\nparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 15:36:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 15:42:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

The\nimaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique (from 100 GeV to 10 TeV) provides\ninsufficient angular resolution (few arc-minutes) to resolve the M87 emission\nregion. However, the short time scale variability observed by MAGIC, HESS and\nVERITAS suggests the TeV emission is coming from a very small region, most\nlikely close to the core. We propose that the variable TeV emission may be\nproduced in a pair-starved region of the central black hole (BH) magnetosphere,\ni.e. a region where the density of the electron-positron plasma is not\nsufficient to completely screen the accelerating electric field. The funnel, a\nlow density and magnetically dominated region around the poles, appears as a\nfavourable site of low-density where a Blandford-Znajek process may explain the\nmain properties of the TeV $\\gamma$-ray emission from M87. We produce a\nbroadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the resulting radiation and\ncompare the model with the observed fluxes from the nucleus of M87, for both\nlow and high $\\gamma$-ray activities.
