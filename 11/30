Our framework allows one to compute the average price\ntrajectory in the presence of a meta-order, that consistently generalizes\npreviously proposed propagator models. We account for the universally observed\nsquare-root impact law, and predict non-trivial trajectories when trading is\ninterrupted or reversed. We prove that our framework is free of price\nmanipulation, and that prices can be made diffusive (albeit with a generic\nshort-term mean-reverting contribution). Our model suggests that prices can be\ndecomposed into a transient \"mechanical\" impact component and a permanent\n\"informational\" component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Nov 2014 19:19:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Dec 2014 08:24:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 Dec 2014 16:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2015 12:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-03"}

The particles are pinned to the\ninterface by restricting their movement in the direction perpendicular to it\nwhile allowing their free rotations. The six different polyhedral shapes\nstudied in this work are selected from a family of truncated cubes defined by a\ntruncation parameter, s, which varies from cubes (s = 0) via cuboctahedra (s =\n0.5) to octahedra (s = 1). Our results suggest that shapes with small values of\ns show square-like behavior whereas shapes with large values of s tend to show\nmore disc-like behavior. At an intermediate value of s = 0.4, the phase\nbehavior of the system shows both square-like and disc-like features. The\nresults are also compared with the phase behavior of 3D bulk polyhedra and of\n2D rounded hard squares. Both comparisons reveal key similarities in the number\nand sequence of mesophases and solid phases observed. These insights on 2D\nentropic self-assembly of polyhedral particles is a first step toward\nunderstanding the self-assembly of particles at fluid-fluid interfaces, which\nis driven by a complex interplay of entropic and enthalpic forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Nov 2014 22:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

In these approaches,\nthe microscopic domains are modeled with atomistic or quantum mechanical\ndescriptions, while continuum mechanics models (including fluid mechanics,\nelastic mechanics, and continuum electrostatics) are applied to the macroscopic\ndomains. This multiphysics description is integrated through an energy\nfunctional formalism and the resulting Euler-Lagrange equation is employed to\nderive a variety of governing partial differential equations for different\nsolvation and transport processes; e.g., the Laplace-Beltrami equation for the\nsolvent-solute interface, Poisson or Poisson-Boltzmann equations for\nelectrostatic potentials, the Nernst-Planck equation for ion densities, and the\nKohn-Sham equation for solute electron density.

Using the void catalog constructed by Pan et al.\n(2012) from the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS\nDR7), we detect a clear 4 sigma signal of spatial correlations of the void\nshapes on the scale of 20 Mpc/h and show that the signal is robust against the\nprojection of the void shapes onto the plane of sky. By constructing a simple\nanalytic model for the void shape correlation, within the framework of tidal\ntorque theory, we demonstrate that the void shape correlation function scales\nlinearly with the two-point correlation function of the linear density field.\nWe also find a direct observational evidence for the cross-correlation of the\nvoid shapes with the large-scale velocity shear field that was linearly\nreconstructed by Lee et al.

It is also known as\n$n$-homological algebra where $n \\geq 2$ is a fixed integer, and it deals with\n$n$-cluster tilting subcategories of abelian categories.\n  All short exact sequences in such a subcategory are split, but it has nice\nexact sequences with $n+2$ objects. This was recently formalised by Jasso in\nthe theory of $n$-abelian categories. There is also a derived version of\n$n$-homological algebra, formalised by Geiss, Keller, and Oppermann in the\ntheory of $( n+2 )$-angulated categories (the reason for the shift from $n$ to\n$n+2$ is that angulated categories have triangulated categories as the \"base\ncase\").\n  We introduce torsion classes and t-structures into the theory of $n$-abelian\nand $( n+2 )$-angulated categories, and prove several results to motivate the\ndefinitions. Most of the results concern the $n$-abelian and $( n+2\n)$-angulated categories ${\\mathcal M}( \\Lambda )$ and ${\\mathcal C}( \\Lambda )$\nassociated to an $n$-representation finite algebra $\\Lambda$, as defined by\nIyama and Oppermann.

In the ballistic regime an irreducible decomposition of\ntypical polymers leads to an effectiverandom walk reinterpretation of the\nlatter.

In the quenched case, the renewal structure\nmaps the model of stretched polymers into an effective model of directed\npolymers. As a result one is able to use techniques and ideas developed in the\ncontext of directed polymers in order to address issues like strong disorder in\nlow dimensions and weak disorder in higher dimensions. Among the topics\naddressed: Thermodynamics of quenched and annealed models, multi-dimensional\nrenewal theory (under Cramer's condition), renormalization and effective random\nwalk structure of annealed polymers, very weak disorder in dimensions $d\\geq 4$\nand strong disorder in dimensions $d=1,2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Nov 2014 15:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approximation for concisely representing the\ncapabilities of a heterogeneous aggregation of flexible loads.

The set-wise sum of the loads is\nthe Minkowski sum, which is in general computationally intractable. Our\nrepresentation is an outer approximation of the Minkowski sum.
