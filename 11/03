We attempt to answer four questions. First, how often are older\narticles cited and how has this changed over time. Second, how does the impact\nof older articles vary across different research fields. Third, is the change\nin the impact of older articles accelerating or slowing down. Fourth, are these\ntrends different for much older articles.\n  To answer these questions, we studied citations from articles published in\n1990-2013. We computed the fraction of citations to older articles from\narticles published each year as the measure of impact. We considered articles\nthat were published at least 10 years before the citing article as older\narticles. We computed these numbers for 261 subject categories and 9 broad\nareas of research. Finally, we repeated the computation for two other\ndefinitions of older articles, 15 years and older and 20 years and older.\n  There are three conclusions from our study. First, the impact of older\narticles has grown substantially over 1990-2013. In 2013, 36% of citations were\nto articles that are at least 10 years old; this fraction has grown 28% since\n1990. The fraction of older citations increased over 1990-2013 for 7 out of 9\nbroad areas and 231 out of 261 subject categories. Second, the increase over\nthe second half (2002-2013) was double the increase in the first half\n(1990-2001).\n  Third, the trend of a growing impact of older articles also holds for even\nolder articles. In 2013, 21% of citations were to articles >= 15 years old with\nan increase of 30% since 1990 and 13% of citations were to articles >= 20 years\nold with an increase of 36%.\n  Now that finding and reading relevant older articles is about as easy as\nfinding and reading recently published articles, significant advances aren't\ngetting lost on the shelves and are influencing work worldwide for years after.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2014 16:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-04"}

Here, we\npresent a method to compute the many-body hydrodynamic interaction between $N$\nspherical active particles induced by their exterior microhydrodynamic flow.\nFirst, we use a boundary integral representation of the Stokes equation to\neliminate bulk fluid degrees of freedom.

We report this hypothesis' first quantitative prediction,\nderived without free parameters, and its confirmation by human behavioral data.\nThe hypothesis provides a direct link between V1 neural responses to a visual\nlocation and the saliency of that location to guide attention exogenously. In a\nvisual input containing many bars, one of them saliently different from all the\nother bars which are identical to each other, saliency at the singleton's\nlocation can be measured by the shortness of the reaction time in a visual\nsearch task to find the singleton. The hypothesis predicts quantitatively the\nwhole distribution of the reaction times to find a singleton unique in color,\norientation, and motion direction from the reaction times to find other types\nof singletons. The predicted distribution matches the experimentally observed\ndistribution in all six human observers. A requirement for this successful\nprediction is a data-motivated assumption that V1 lacks neurons tuned\nsimultaneously to color, orientation, and motion direction of visual inputs.\nSince evidence suggests that extrastriate cortices do have such neurons, we\ndiscuss the possibility that the extrastriate cortices play no role in guiding\nexogenous attention so that they can be devoted to other functional roles like\nvisual decoding or endogenous attention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2014 18:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-08"}

To solve this corrector problem in the\nperiodic setting, Moulinec and Suquet introduced in the mid-nineties a\nnumerical strategy based on the reformulation of that problem as an integral\nequation (known as the Lippmann--Schwinger equation), which is then suitably\ndiscretized. This results in an iterative, matrix-free method, which is of\nparticular interest for complex microstructures. Since the seminal work of\nMoulinec and Suquet, several variants of their scheme have been proposed.\n  The aim of this contribution is twofold. First, we provide an overview of\nthese methods, recast in the language of the applied mathematics community.\nThese methods are presented as asymptotically consistent Galerkin\ndiscretizations of the Lippmann--Schwinger equation. The bilinear form arising\nin the weak form of this integral equation is indeed the sum of a local and a\nnon-local term. We show that most of the variants proposed in the literature\ncorrespond to alternative approximations of this non-local term. Second, we\npropose a mathematical analysis of the discretized problem. In particular, we\nprove under mild hypotheses the convergence of these numerical schemes with\nrespect to the grid-size. We also provide a priori error estimates on the\nsolution.\n  The article closes on a three-dimensional numerical application within the\nframework of linear elasticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2014 22:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-04"}

In general, the accretion will have a different specific\nangular momentum than the part of the disk that receives it, even if the gas\ncomes from the nearby halo.

It is shown that the particle acceleration is\ndetermined by the friction force in the particle rest reference frame\n($K^{\\prime}$-frame) which in general is not equal to the friction force in the\nframe of the blackbody radiation ($K$-frame). The difference between the\nfriction forces in the different frames is connected with the change of the\nrest mass of a particle due to the absorption and emission of radiation. The\nfriction force in the $K^{\\prime}$-frame is determined only by the interaction\nof a particle with the blackbody radiation. In the $K$-frame the interaction of\na particle with its own thermal radiation also contributes to the friction\nforce. For the steady state temperature of a particle the friction forces in\nthe $K^{\\prime}$-and $K$-frames are equal. For an atom the blackbody friction\nis determined by the electronic linewidth broadening which is calculated\nconsidering the interaction of an atom with its own radiation. In the\nultrarelativistic case ($1-\\beta\\rightarrow 0$) for an atom the friction force\ndiverges as $(1-\\beta)^{-3}$ and the (average) temperature of an atom\n$T_2\\approx (1-\\beta)^{-3/8}T_1$, where $T_1$ is the temperature of the\nblackbody radiation and $\\beta=V/c$.

The quality of a least-squares\napproximation can be assessed in different ways: either in terms of the value\nof the quadratic objective function (cost approximation), or in terms of some\ndistance measure between the approximate minimizer and the true minimizer\n(solution approximation). Focusing on the latter criterion, our first main\nresult provides a general lower bound on any randomized method that sketches\nboth the data matrix and vector in a least-squares problem; as a surprising\nconsequence, the most widely used least-squares sketch is sub-optimal for\nsolution approximation. We then present a new method known as the iterative\nHessian sketch, and show that it can be used to obtain approximations to the\noriginal least-squares problem using a projection dimension proportional to the\nstatistical complexity of the least-squares minimizer, and a logarithmic number\nof iterations.

In order to maximize performance, dynamic language\nVM implementations must attempt to eliminate redundant dynamic type checks.\nHowever, type inference analyses are often costly and involve tradeoffs between\ncompilation time and resulting precision. This has lead to the creation of\nincreasingly complex multi-tiered VM architectures.\n  This paper introduces lazy basic block versioning, a simple JIT compilation\ntechnique which effectively removes redundant type checks from critical code\npaths. This novel approach lazily generates type-specialized versions of basic\nblocks on-the-fly while propagating context-dependent type information. This\ndoes not require the use of costly program analyses, is not restricted by the\nprecision limitations of traditional type analyses and avoids the\nimplementation complexity of speculative optimization techniques.\n  We have implemented intraprocedural lazy basic block versioning in a\nJavaScript JIT compiler. This approach is compared with a classical flow-based\ntype analysis. Lazy basic block versioning performs as well or better on all\nbenchmarks. On average, 71% of type tests are eliminated, yielding speedups of\nup to 50%. We also show that our implementation generates more efficient\nmachine code than TraceMonkey, a tracing JIT compiler for JavaScript, on\nseveral benchmarks. The combination of implementation simplicity, low\nalgorithmic complexity and good run time performance makes basic block\nversioning attractive for baseline JIT compilers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 03:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 18:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-01"}

We characterize the HI\nspectra of the individual detections using the busy function (Westmeier et al.\n2014).\n  With the goal of identifying different morphological structures of HI, we\nstudy the kinematical and radio source properties of the detections as function\nof their width. Narrow lines (FWHM < 100 km/s) mostly lie at the systemic\nvelocity and are likely produced by regularly rotating HI disks or clouds. More\nHI disks can be present among galaxies with lines of intermediate widths (100\nkm/s < FWHM < 200 km/s), however the HI in these sources is more unsettled.\n  We study the asymmetry parameter and blueshift/redshift distribution of the\nlines.

In\ncurrent algorithms, the environment is computed at each step of the imaginary\ntime evolution, to account for the changes that the time evolution introduces\nin the many-body state represented by the tensor network.

Indeed, a consistent choice of gauge in the bond\nindices confirms that the environment is essentially the same over many time\nsteps and can thus be re-used, leading to very substantial computational\nsavings.

We do show that the velocity and\nposition is consistent with a bound orbit originating in the clockwise disk of\nmassive stars orbiting Sgr A* and a natal velocity kick of <~ 500 km s^-1. An\norigin among the isotropic stellar cluster is possible but less probable. If\nthe pulsar remains radio-bright, multi-year astrometry of PSR J1745-2900 can\ndetect its acceleration and determine the full three-dimensional orbit. We also\ndemonstrate that PSR J1745-2900 exhibits the same angular broadening as Sgr A*\nover a wavelength range of 3.6 cm to 0.7 cm, further confirming that the two\nsources share the same interstellar scattering properties. Finally, we place\nthe first limits on the presence of a wavelength-dependent shift in the\nposition of Sgr A*, i.e., the core shift, one of the expected properties of\noptically-thick jet emission. Our results for PSR J1745-2900 support the\nhypothesis that Galactic Center pulsars will originate from the stellar disk\nand deepens the mystery regarding the small number of detected Galactic Center\npulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 08:58:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 01:38:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-17"}

Usually,\nlifetime is modelled as a continuous random variable, for instance\nexponentially or Weibull distributed. However, in some cases, the features of\nthe piece of equipment under investigation rather suggest the use of discrete\nprobabilistic models. This happens for an equipment which only operates on\ncycles or on demand. In these cases, the lifetime is rather measured in number\nof cycles or number of demands before failure, therefore, in theory, discrete\nmodels should be more appropriate. This article aims at bringing some light to\nthe practical interest for the reliability engineer in using two discrete\nmodels among the most popular: the Inverse Polya distribution (IPD), based on a\nPolya urn scheme, and the so-called Weibull-1 (W1) model. It is showed that,\nfor different reasons, the practical use of both models should be restricted to\nspecific industrial situations. In particular, when nothing is a priori known\nover the nature of ageing and/or data are heavily right-censored, they can\nremain of limited interest with respect to more flexible continuous lifetime\nmodels such as the usual Weibull distribution. Nonetheless, the intuitive\nmeaning given to the IPD distribution favors its use by engineers in low\n(decelerated) ageing situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 10:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-04"}

The main idea is the coexistence of two Poisson brackets, one for each\nspacetime coordinate. The Poisson bracket corresponding to the time coordinate\nis the usual one describing the time evolution of the system. Taking the\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) equation as an example, we introduce the new\nbracket associated to the space coordinate. We show that, in the absence of any\ndefect, the two brackets yield completely equivalent Hamiltonian descriptions\nof the model. However, in the presence of a defect described by a frozen\nB\\\"acklund transformation, the advantage of using the new bracket becomes\nevident. It allows us to reinterpret the defect conditions as canonical\ntransformations. As a consequence, we are also able to implement the method of\nthe classical r matrix and to prove Liouville integrability of the system with\nsuch a defect. The use of the new Poisson bracket completely bypasses all the\nknown problems associated with the presence of a defect in the discussion of\nLiouville integrability. A by-product of the approach is the reinterpretation\nof the defect Lagrangian used in the Lagrangian description of integrable\ndefects as the generating function of the canonical transformation representing\nthe defect conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 10:26:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 16:40:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Feb 2015 10:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The concept of quantum steering recently\ndefined in a rigorous manner is relevant to study it under certain\ncircumstances and we here address quantum steerability of Gaussian states to\nthis aim. In particular, we attempt to reformulate the criterion for Gaussian\nsteering in terms of local and global purities and show that it is sufficient\nand necessary for the case of steering a 1-mode system by a $N$-mode system. It\nsubsequently enables us to reinforce a strong monogamy relation under which\nonly one party can steer a local system of 1-mode. Moreover, we show that only\na negative partial-transpose state can manifest quantum steerability by\nGaussian measurements in relation to the Peres conjecture. We also discuss our\nformulation for the case of distributing a two-mode squeezed state via one-way\nquantum channels making dissipation and amplification effects, respectively.\nFinally, we extend our approach to include non-Gaussian measurements, more\nprecisely, all orders of higher-order squeezing measurements, and find that\nthis broad set of non-Gaussian measurements is not useful to demonstrate\nsteering for Gaussian states beyond Gaussian measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 11:46:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2015 05:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Model- driven development (MDD) promises to improve software\nproductivity, timeliness, quality and cost through the transformation of\nabstract application models to code-level implementations. However, it remains\nunreasonably difficult to build the modeling languages and translators required\nfor software synthesis. This difficulty, in turns, limits the applicability of\nMDD, and makes it hard to achieve reliability in MDD tools. This dissertation\nresearch seeks to reduce the cost, broaden the applicability, and increase the\nquality of model-driven development systems by embedding modeling languages\nwithin established formal languages and by using the analyzers provided with\nsuch languages for synthesis purposes to reduce the need for hand coding of\ntranslators. This dissertation, in particular, explores the proposed approach\nusing relational logic as expressed in Alloy as the general specification\nlanguage, and the Alloy Analyzer as the general-purpose analyzer. Synthesis is\nthus driven by finite-domain constraint satisfaction. One important aspect of\nthis work is its focus on partial specifications of particular aspects of the\nsystem, such as application architectures and target platforms, and synthesis\nof partial code bases from such specifications.

This paper is aimed to probe the dynamo hysteresis predicted\nby the recent mean-field models of Kitchatinov \\& Olemskoy (2010) with direct\nnumerical simulations. We perform three-dimensional simulations of large-scale\ndynamos in a shearing box with helically forced turbulence. As initial\ncondition, we either take a weak random magnetic field or we start from a\nsnapshot of an earlier simulation. Two quasi-stable states are found to coexist\nin a certain range of parameters close to the onset of the large-scale dynamo.\nThe simulations converge to one of these states depending on the initial\nconditions. When either the fractional helicity or the magnetic Prandtl number\nis increased between successive runs above the critical value for onset of the\ndynamo, the field strength jumps to a finite value. However, when the\nfractional helicity or the magnetic Prandtl number is then decreased again, the\nfield strength stays at a similar value (strong field branch) even below the\noriginal onset. We also observe intermittent decaying phases away from the\nstrong field branch close to the point where large-scale dynamo action is just\npossible. The dynamo hysteresis seen previously in mean-field models is thus\nreproduced by 3D simulations. Its possible relation to distinct modes of solar\nactivity such as grand minima is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 13:46:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jan 2015 16:51:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Feb 2015 16:00:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 14:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

Here, we propose a framework for\nthe extraction of a nanoscale histone-DNA force-field from a collection of\nhigh-resolution structures, which may be adapted to a larger class of\nprotein-DNA complexes. We apply the procedure on a large crystallographic\ndatabase extended by snapshots from molecular dynamics simulations. The\ncomparison of the structural models first shows that, at the sites of\nhistone-DNA contact, the DNA base-pairs are locally shifted outwards,\nconsistent with locally repulsive forces exerted by the histones. In a second\nstep, we show that the various force profiles of the analyzed structures derive\nlocally from a unique, sequence-independent, quadratic repulsive force field,\nwhile the sequence preferences are entirely due to the internal DNA mechanics.\nWe thus obtain the first knowledge-derived nanoscale potential for the\nhistone-DNA interaction in the nucleosome. The conformations obtained by\nrelaxation of nucleosomal DNA with high-affinity sequences in this potential\naccurately reproduce experimental values of binding preferences. We finally\naddress the more generic binding mechanisms relevant to the 80% genomic\nsequences incorporated in nucleosomes, by computing the conformation of\nnucleosomal DNA with sequence-averaged properties. This conformation is found\nto differ from those found in crystals, and the analysis suggests that\nrepulsive histone forces are related to a local stretch tension in nucleosomal\nDNA, mostly between successive contact points. This tension could play a role\nin the stability of the complex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 13:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We show that approximately enforcing $N$-representability\nduring time evolution is essential for achieving stable solutions. As a\nprototypical test case which features long-range Coulomb interactions we employ\nthe one-dimensional model for lithium hydride (LiH) in strong infrared laser\nfields. We probe both one-particle observables such as the time-dependent\ndipole moment and two-particle observables such as the pair density and mean\nelectron-electron interaction energy. Our results are in very good agreement\nwith numerically exact solutions for the $N$-electron wavefunction obtained\nfrom the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 14:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-20"}

Junctions are connected in pairs, each pair - by a\nsingle soliton. The webs expand in time. As distances between junctions grow,\nthe memory of the structure of junctions in a connected pair ceases to affect\nthe structure of either junction.

Several recent\nstudies of the angular clustering of obscured quasars have shown that these\nobjects likely reside in higher-mass halos compared to their unobscured\ncounterparts.

We show\nthe LHC limits and reach at 8 and 14 TeV for models with all four messenger\ntypes. We also outline the complementarity of direct detection, indirect\ndetection and LHC bounds for dark matter searches. Finally, we investigate the\neffects which arise from extending the simplified model to include potential\nnew physics contributions in production. Using the scalar mediator as an\nexample we study the impact of heavy new physics loops which interfere with the\ntop mediated loops.
