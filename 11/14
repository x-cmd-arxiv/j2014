Natural communication processes (say between\nhumans) however often involve large amounts of shared correlations among the\ncommunicating players, but rarely allow for perfect sharing of randomness. Can\nthe communication complexity benefit from shared correlations as well as it\ndoes from shared randomness? This question was considered mainly in the context\nof simultaneous communication by Bavarian et al. (ICALP 2014). In this work we\nstudy this problem in the standard interactive setting and give some general\nresults. In particular, we show that every problem with communication\ncomplexity of $k$ bits with perfectly shared randomness has a protocol using\nimperfectly shared randomness with complexity $\\exp(k)$ bits. We also show that\nthis is best possible by exhibiting a promise problem with complexity $k$ bits\nwith perfectly shared randomness which requires $\\exp(k)$ bits when the\nrandomness is imperfectly shared. Along the way we also highlight some other\nbasic problems such as compression, and agreement distillation, where shared\nrandomness plays a central role and analyze the complexity of these problems in\nthe imperfectly shared randomness model.\n  The technical highlight of this work is the lower bound that goes into the\nresult showing the tightness of our general connection. This result builds on\nthe intuition that communication with imperfectly shared randomness needs to be\nless sensitive to its random inputs than communication with perfectly shared\nrandomness. The formal proof invokes results about the small-set expansion of\nthe noisy hypercube and an invariance principle to convert this intuition to a\nproof, thus giving a new application domain for these fundamental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 16:23:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 18:56:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 18:25:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 17:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-28"}

The standard\nform of the electric AB effect involves having particles (such as electrons)\nmove in regions with zero electric field but different electric potentials.\nWhen a particle is recombined with itself, it will have a different phase,\nwhich can show up as a change in the way the single particle interferes with\nitself when it is recombined with itself. In the case where one has\nquasi-static fields and potentials, the particle will invariably encounter\nfringing fields, which makes the theoretical and experimental status of the\nelectric AB effect much less clear than that of the magnetic (or vector) AB\neffect. Here we propose using time varying fields outside of a spherical shell,\nand potentials inside a spherical shell to experimentally test the scalar AB\neffect. In our proposal a quantum system will always be in a field-free region\nbut subjected to a non-zero time-varying potentials. Furthermore, our system\nwill not be spatially split and brought back together as in the magnetic AB\nexperiment. Therefore there is no spatial interference and hence no shift in a\nspatial interference pattern to observe. Rather, there arises purely temporal\ninterference phenomena. As in the magnetic AB experiments, these effects are\nnon-classical.

In general, the D3'-brane probe supports a magnetic monopole as a\nnon-singular soliton configuration, but in the limit where the MPS dynamics is\nrecovered, the soliton degenerates. This is consistent with the idea that the\neffective dynamics in the MPS setup is incomplete, but that it can be completed\nwith a single tower of Regge trajectory states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 19:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

This fact alone, however,\ndoes not always deter selfish individuals from defecting. The temptations to\nfree-ride on the prosocial efforts of others are strong because we are\nhardwired to maximize our own fitness regardless of the consequences this might\nhave for the public good. Here we show that the addition of risky assets to the\npersonal endowments, both of which are lost if the collective target is not\nreached, can contribute to solving the collective-risk social dilemma. In\ninfinite well-mixed populations risky assets introduce new stable and unstable\nmixed steady states, whereby the stable mixed steady state converges to full\ncooperation as either the risk of collective failure or the amount of risky\nassets increases. Similarly, in finite well-mixed populations the introduction\nof risky assets enforces configurations where cooperative behavior thrives. In\nstructured populations cooperation is promoted as well, but the distribution of\nassets amongst the groups is crucial. Surprisingly, we find that the completely\nrational allocation of assets only to the most successful groups is not\noptimal, and this regardless of whether the risk of collective failure is high\nor low. Instead, in low-risk situations bounded rational allocation of assets\nworks best, while in high-risk situations the simplest uniform distribution of\nassets among all the groups is optimal. These results indicate that prosocial\nbehavior depends sensitively on the potential losses individuals are likely to\nendure if they fail to cooperate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 20:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

As\necological scenario we use a generalized island model with soft selection\nwithin patches in which we incorporate generation overlap. We allow for\narbitrary fluctuations in the environment including spatio-temporal\ncorrelations and any functional form of selection on the trait. Using the\nconcepts of invasion fitness and evolutionary branching, we derive a simple and\ntransparent condition for the adaptive evolution and maintenance of genetic\ndiversity.

We give an explicit\nexample of such a model for the coset space $SU(3)/SU(2) \\times U(1)$, with the\nHiggs as the NGB, including breaking the inflaton's shift symmetry and\nproducing a chaotic inflation potential. This construction can also be applied\nto other models, such as one based on $E_7/SO(10) \\times U(1) \\times U(1)$\nwhich incorporates the first two generations of (light) quarks as the\nNambu-Goldstone multiplets, and has an axion in addition to the inflaton. Along\nthe way we clarify and connect previous work on understanding NLSMs in\nsupergravity and the origin of the extra field (which is the inflaton here),\nincluding a connection to Witten-Bagger quantization. This framework has wide\napplications to model building; a light particle from a NLSM requires, in\nsupergravity, exactly the structure for chaotic inflaton or an axion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-19"}

The\ncorresponding near-inertial waves (NIWs) are highly energetic and play a\nsignificant role in the slow, large-scale dynamics of the ocean. To analyse\nthis role, we develop a new model of the nondissipative interactions between\nNIWs and balanced motion. The model is derived using the\ngeneralised-Lagrangian-mean (GLM) framework (specifically, the glm variant of\nSoward & Roberts (2010)), taking advantage of the time-scale separation between\nthe two types of motion to average over the short NIW period.\n  We combine Salmon's (2013) variational formulation of GLM with Whitham\naveraging to obtain a system of equations governing the joint evolution of NIWs\nand mean flow. Assuming that the mean flow is geostrophically balanced reduces\nthis system to a simple model coupling Young & Ben Jelloul's (1997) equation\nfor NIWs with a modified quasi-geostrophic equation. In this coupled model, the\nmean flow affects the NIWs through advection and refraction; conversely, the\nNIWs affect the mean flow by modifying the potential-vorticity inversion - the\nrelation between advected potential vorticity and advecting mean velocity -\nthrough a quadratic wave term, consistent with the GLM results of Bu\u007fhler &\nMcIntyre (1998).\n  The coupled model is Hamiltonian and its conservation laws, for wave action\nand energy in particular, prove illuminating: on their basis, we identify a new\ninteraction mechanism whereby NIWs forced at large scales extract energy from\nthe balanced flow as their horizontal scale is reduced by differential\nadvection and refraction so that their potential energy increases. A rough\nestimate suggests that this mechanism could provide a significant sink of\nenergy for mesoscale motion and play a part in the global energetics of the\nocean.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 21:34:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 23:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-01"}

Many sets of network\ndata such as e-mail networks, social networks, or internet traffic networks are\nbest represented by a dynamic network due to the temporal component of the\ndata. One important application in the domain of dynamic network analysis is\nanomaly detection. Here the task is to identify points in time where the\nnetwork exhibits behavior radically different from a typical time, either due\nto some event (like the failure of machines in a computer network) or a shift\nin the network properties. This problem is made more difficult by the fluid\nnature of what is considered \"normal\" network behavior. The volume of traffic\non a network, for example, can change over the course of a month or even vary\nbased on the time of the day without being considered unusual. Anomaly\ndetection tests using traditional network statistics have difficulty in these\nscenarios due to their Density Dependence: as the volume of edges changes the\nvalue of the statistics changes as well making it difficult to determine if the\nchange in signal is due to the traffic volume or due to some fundamental shift\nin the behavior of the network. To more accurately detect anomalies in dynamic\nnetworks, we introduce the concept of Density-Consistent network statistics. On\nsynthetically generated graphs anomaly detectors using these statistics show a\na 20-400% improvement in the recall when distinguishing graphs drawn from\ndifferent distributions.

These transfer functions are commonly used to represent the\nelectrical response of high speed digital interconnects used on chip and in\nelectronic package assemblies. In some cases small errors in the model\ndevelopment lead to non-causal behavior that does not accurately represent the\nelectrical response and may lead to a lack of convergence in simulations that\nutilize these models. The approach is based on Hilbert transform relations or\nKramers-Kronig dispersion relations and a construction of causal Fourier\ncontinuations using a regularized singular value decomposition (SVD) method.\nGiven a transfer function, non-periodic in general, this procedure constructs\nhighly accurate Fourier series approximations on the given frequency interval\nby allowing the function to be periodic in an extended domain. The causality\ndispersion relations are enforced spectrally and exactly. This eliminates the\nnecessity of approximating the transfer function behavior at infinity and\nexplicit computation of the Hilbert transform. We perform the error analysis of\nthe method and take into account a possible presence of a noise or\napproximation errors in data. The developed error estimates can be used in\nverifying causality of the given data. The performance of the method is tested\non several analytic and simulated examples that demonstrate an excellent\naccuracy and reliability of the proposed technique in agreement with the\nobtained error estimates. The method is capable of detecting very small\nlocalized causality violations with amplitudes close to the machine precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 07:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

Such requests are inherently multi-dimensional and\ncharacterized by demand vectors over multiple resources such as processor\ncycles, storage space, and network bandwidth. Typically, different resources\nrequire different objectives to be optimized, and $L_r$ norms of loads are\namong the most popular objectives considered. To address these problems, we\nconsider the online vector scheduling problem in this paper. Introduced by\nChekuri and Khanna (SIAM J of Comp. 2006), vector scheduling is a\ngeneralization of classical load balancing, where every job has a vector load\ninstead of a scalar load. In this paper, we resolve the online complexity of\nthe vector scheduling problem and its important generalizations. Our main\nresults are:\n  -For identical machines, we show that the optimal competitive ratio is\n$\\Theta(\\log d / \\log \\log d)$ by giving an online lower bound and an algorithm\nwith an asymptotically matching competitive ratio. The lower bound is\ntechnically challenging, and is obtained via an online lower bound for the\nminimum mono-chromatic clique problem using a novel online coloring game and\nrandomized coding scheme.\n  -For unrelated machines, we show that the optimal competitive ratio is\n$\\Theta(\\log m + \\log d)$ by giving an online lower bound that matches a\npreviously known upper bound. Unlike identical machines, however, extending\nthese results, particularly the upper bound, to general $L_r$ norms requires\nnew ideas. In particular, we use a carefully constructed potential function\nthat balances the individual $L_r$ objectives with the overall (convexified)\nmin-max objective to guide the online algorithm and track the changes in\npotential to bound the competitive ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 12:51:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2015 16:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

To generate efficient coverings of\narbitrary parameter spaces, stochastic template banks have been advocated,\nwhere templates are placed at random while rejecting those too close to others.\nHowever, in this simple scheme, for each new random point its distance to every\ntemplate in the existing bank is computed. This rapidly increasing number of\ndistance computations can render the acceptance of new templates\ncomputationally prohibitive, particularly for wide parameter spaces or in large\ndimensions. This work presents a neighboring cell algorithm that can\ndramatically improve the efficiency of constructing a stochastic template bank.\nBy dividing the parameter space into sub-volumes (cells), for an arbitrary\npoint an efficient hashing technique is exploited to obtain the index of its\nenclosing cell along with the parameters of its neighboring templates. Hence\nonly distances to these neighboring templates in the bank are computed,\nmassively lowering the overall computing cost, as demonstrated in simple\nexamples. Furthermore, we propose a novel method based on this technique to\nincrease the fraction of covered parameter space solely by directed template\nshifts, without adding any templates.

We show that when the open quantum system undergoes a first-order\ndynamical phase transition the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which gives\nthe upper bound on the achievable precision of any measurement of the system\nand environment, becomes quadratic in observation time (cf. \"Heisenberg\nscaling\"). In fact, the QFI is identical to the variance of the dynamical\nobservable that characterises the phases that coexist at the transition, and\nenhanced scaling is a consequence of the divergence of the variance of this\nobservable at the transition point. This identification allows to establish the\nfinite time scaling of the QFI. Near the transition the QFI is quadratic in\ntime for times shorter than the correlation time of the dynamics. In the regime\nof enhanced scaling the optimal measurement whose precision is given by the QFI\ninvolves measuring both system and output. As a particular realisation of these\nideas, we describe a theoretical scheme for quantum enhanced phase estimation\nusing the photons being emitted from a quantum system near the coexistence of\ndynamical phases with distinct photon emission rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 14:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

The difficult trajectory\nplanning problem is solved in two separate, simpler, steps: first, find a path\nin the configuration space that satisfies the geometric constraints (path\nplanning), and second, find a time-parameterization of that path satisfying the\nkinodynamic constraints. A fundamental requirement is that the path found in\nthe first step should be time-parameterizable. Most existing works fulfill this\nrequirement by enforcing quasi-static constraints in the path planning step,\nresulting in an important loss in completeness. We propose a method that\nenables path-velocity decomposition to discover truly dynamic motions, i.e.\nmotions that are not quasi-statically executable. At the heart of the proposed\nmethod is a new algorithm -- Admissible Velocity Propagation -- which, given a\npath and an interval of reachable velocities at the beginning of that path,\ncomputes exactly and efficiently the interval of all the velocities the system\ncan reach after traversing the path while respecting the system kinodynamic\nconstraints. Combining this algorithm with usual sampling-based planners then\ngives rise to a family of new trajectory planners that can appropriately handle\nkinodynamic constraints while retaining the advantages associated with\npath-velocity decomposition. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed\nmethod on some difficult kinodynamic planning problems, where, in particular,\nquasi-static methods are guaranteed to fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 08:54:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 May 2015 02:41:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 02:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-03"}
