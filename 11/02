While the original Little\nFlavor only included the quark sector, here we build the lepton part of the\nLittle Flavor model and explore its phenomenology. The model produces the\nneutrino mixing matrix and Majorana masses of the Standard Model neutrinos\nthrough coupling to heavy lepton partners and Little Higgses. We combine the\nusual right-handed seesaw mechanism with global symmetry protection to suppress\nthe Standard Model neutrino masses, and identify the TeV partners of leptons as\nright-handed Majorana neutrinos. The lepton masses and mixing matrix are\ncalculated perturbatively in the theory.\n  The TeV new gauge bosons have suppressed decay width in dilepton channels.\nEven assuming the Standard Model couplings, the branching ratios to normal\ndilepton channels are largely reduced in the model, to evade the bound from\ncurrent $Z'$ search. It also opens up the new search channels for exotic gauge\nbosons, especially Z' -> MET + multi L+jets. The multiple lepton partners will\ncreate new chain decay signals in flavor related processes in colliders, which\nalso give rise to flavor anomalies. The lepton flavor violation process can be\nhighly suppressed in charged lepton sector and happens only through neutrinos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Nov 2014 16:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 09:44:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 16:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-25"}

We\nconsider the crowdsourcing task of learning the answer to simple\nmultiple-choice HITs, which are representative of many relevance experiments.\nIn order to provide statistically significant results, one often needs to ask\nmultiple workers to answer the same HIT.

When the internal\ntemperature drops below the maximum of the critical temperature over the core,\n$T_{\\rm C}$, this superfluidity sets in. It produces a neutrino outburst due to\nCooper pairing of neutrons which greatly accelerates the cooling. We show that\nthe cooling of the star with internal temperature $T$ within $0.6\\,T_{\\rm C}\n\\lesssim T \\leq T_{\\rm C}$ is described by analytic self-similar relations. A\nmeasurement of the effective surface temperature of the star and its decline,\nsupplemented by assumptions on star's mass, radius and composition of\nheat-blanketing envelope, allows one to construct a family of cooling models\nparametrized by the value of $T_{\\rm C}$. Each model reconstructs cooling\nhistory of the star including its neutrino emission level before neutron\nsuperfluidity onset and the intensity of Cooper pairing neutrinos. The results\nare applied to interpret the observations of the neutron star in the Cassiopeia\nA supernova remnant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Nov 2014 18:33:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 16:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-15"}

In\ncontrast, we consider monotone stochastic variational inequality (SVI) problems\nwhere the strong monotonicity and Lipschitzian assumptions on the mappings are\nweakened. In the first part of the paper, to address such shortcomings, a\nregularized smoothed SA (RSSA) scheme is developed wherein the stepsize,\nsmoothing, and regularization parameters are diminishing sequences updated\nafter every iteration. Under suitable assumptions on the sequences, we show\nthat the algorithm generates iterates that converge to a solution in an almost\nsure sense, extending the results in [16] to the non-Lipschitzian regime.\nMotivated by the need to develop non-asymptotic rate statements, in the second\npart of the paper, we develop a variant of the RSSA scheme, denoted by\naRSSA$_r$, in which we employ a weighted iterate-averaging, parametrized by a\nscalar $r$ where $r = 1$ provides us with the standard averaging scheme. We\nmake several contributions in this context: First, we show that the gap\nfunction associated with the sequences by the aRSSA$_r$ scheme tends to zero\nwhen the parameter sequences are chosen appropriately. Second, we show that the\ngap function associated with the averaged sequence diminishes to zero at the\noptimal rate $\\cal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$ after $K$ steps when smoothing and\nregularization are suppressed and $r < 1$, thus improving the rate statement\nfor the standard averaging which admits a rate of $\\cal{O}(\\ln(K)/\\sqrt{K})$.\nThird, we develop a window-based variant of this scheme that also displays the\noptimal rate for $r < 1$. Notably, we prove the superiority of the scheme with\n$r < 1$ with its counterpart with $r=1$ in terms of the constant factor of the\nerror bound when the size of the averaging window is sufficiently large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2014 06:03:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 19:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

The new approach consists of combining the CS with the Nelder-Mead\nmethod. More precisely, instead of using single solutions as nests for the CS,\nwe use the concept of a simplex which is used in the Nelder-Mead algorithm.\nThis makes it possible to use the flip operation introduces in the Nelder-Mead\nalgorithm instead of the Levy flight which is a standard part of the CS. In\nthis way, the hybridized algorithm becomes more robust and less sensitive to\nparameter tuning which exists in CS.

To be specific, only the \"best\" SR\nis chosen in the single-relay selection for assisting the secondary\ntransmission, whereas the multi-relay selection invokes multiple SRs for\nsimultaneously forwarding the ST's transmission to the SD. We analyze both the\nintercept probability and outage probability of the proposed single-relay and\nmulti-relay selection schemes for the secondary transmission relying on\nrealistic spectrum sensing. We also evaluate the performance of classic direct\ntransmission and artificial noise based methods for the purpose of comparison\nwith the proposed relay selection schemes.

This deep\narchitecture is representationally powerful, but it complicates learning by\nmaking it hard to identify the responsible neurons when a mistake is made. In\nmachine learning, the backpropagation algorithm assigns blame to a neuron by\ncomputing exactly how it contributed to an error. To do this, it multiplies\nerror signals by matrices consisting of all the synaptic weights on the\nneuron's axon and farther downstream. This operation requires a precisely\nchoreographed transport of synaptic weight information, which is thought to be\nimpossible in the brain. Here we present a surprisingly simple algorithm for\ndeep learning, which assigns blame by multiplying error signals by random\nsynaptic weights. We show that a network can learn to extract useful\ninformation from signals sent through these random feedback connections. In\nessence, the network learns to learn. We demonstrate that this new mechanism\nperforms as quickly and accurately as backpropagation on a variety of problems\nand describe the principles which underlie its function. Our demonstration\nprovides a plausible basis for how a neuron can be adapted using error signals\ngenerated at distal locations in the brain, and thus dispels long-held\nassumptions about the algorithmic constraints on learning in neural circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Nov 2014 12:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-04"}

The unpredictable synchronization error leads to time domain offset\nand signal arriving order (SAO) ambiguity when two signals sent from two\nsources are superimposed at the relay. A two-step channel estimation algorithm\nis first proposed, in which the linear minimum mean-square-error (LMMSE)\nestimator is used to obtain initial channel estimates based on pilot symbols\nand a linear minimum error probability (LMEP) estimator is then developed to\nupdate these estimates. Optimal training sequences and power allocation at the\nrelay are designed to further improve the performance for LMMSE based initial\nchannel estimation. To tackle the SAO ambiguity problem, the generalized\nlikelihood ratio testing (GLRT) method is applied and an upper bound on the SAO\ndetection error probability is derived. By using the SAO information, a scaled\nLMEP estimation algorithm is proposed to compensate the performance degradation\ncaused by SAO detection error.

Motivated by the decoupling of space points, initial\nconditions characterized by a lack of correlations are investigated.
