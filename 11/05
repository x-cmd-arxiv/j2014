Next, we describe a prolongation functor operating on the\ninfinitesimal symmetries (automorphisms) of the Darboux flag and extending\nthese, isomorphically, to all the symmetries of any other flag. Hence, flag\nsystems cannot be distinguished by their symmetry algebras and the local\nclassification of these objects is approached by considering higher order\nisotropies of these algebras as well as the groupoids of $k-th$ order formal\nequivalences since the differential equations defining the latter provide\nprecious information for the application of flag systems to differential\nequations (\\textit{e.g.}, Cartan's criterion for non-linear Monge equations).\nIn examining the behaviour of the isotropy algebras, that can either diminish\nor remain the same, when passing from a derived system $S_\\nu$ to the previous\nsystem $S_{\\nu-1}$, we obtain a full set of numerical invariants for the\nelementary flag systems that moreover specify the local models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 16:01:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}

We focus on non-linear models\ncontaining a set of parameters governing their dynamics. The value of these\nparameters is often unknown and not directly observable through measurements,\nwhich are themselves noisy. When treating parameters as random variables, one\ncan constrain their distribution by conditioning on observations and thereby\nconstructing a posterior probability distribution. We aim to perform model\nverification with respect to this posterior. The main difficulty in performing\nverification on a model under the posterior distribution is that in general, it\nis difficult to obtain \\emph{independent} samples from the posterior,\nespecially for non-linear dynamical models. Standard statistical model checking\nmethods require independent realizations of the system and are therefore not\napplicable in this context.\n  We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo based statistical model checking\nframework, which produces a sequence of dependent random realizations of the\nmodel dynamics over the parameter posterior. Using this sequence of samples, we\nuse statistical hypothesis tests to verify whether the model satisfies a\nbounded temporal logic property with a certain probability. We use sample size\nbounds tailored to the setting of dependent samples for fixed sample size and\nsequential tests. We apply our method to a case-study from the domain of\nsystems biology, to a model of the JAK-STAT biochemical pathway.

We use recent results from a new theoretical framework--developed\nfrom first principles via a self-consistent perturbation expansion in terms of\nan effective two-body potential--to numerically explore the kinetics of systems\nof classical particles, specifically hard spheres obeying Smoluchowski\ndynamics. We present here a full solution to the kinetic equation governing the\ndensity-density time correlation function and show that the function exhibits\nthe characteristic two-step decay of supercooled fluids and an\nergodic-nonergodic transition to a dynamically-arrested state. Unlike many\nprevious numerical studies and experiments, we have access to the full time and\nwavenumber range of the correlation function and can track the solution\nunprecedentedly close to the transition, covering nearly 15 decades of time.\nUsing asymptotic approximation techniques developed for MCT, we fit the\nsolution to predicted forms and extract critical parameters.

Despite\na considerable amount of work on leader election, the following question is\nstill open: can we elect a leader in an asynchronous fault-prone system faster\nthan just running a $\\Theta(\\log n)$-time tournament, against a strong adaptive\nadversary?\n  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative, improving on a\ndecades-old upper bound.

The sources of this non-volcanic tremor (NVT) are largely\nunknown. We have developed a model describing the mechanism of NTV generation.\nAccording to this model, NTV is a reflection of resonant-type oscillations\nexcited in a fault at certain depth ranges. From a mathematical viewpoint,\ntremor (phonons) and slip pulses (solitons) are two different solutions of the\nsine-Gordon equation describing frictional processes inside a fault. In an ETS\nevent, a moving slip pulse generates tremor due to interaction with structural\nheterogeneities in a fault and to failures of small asperities. Observed tremor\nparameters, such as central frequency and frequency attenuation curve, are\nassociated with fault parameters and conditions, such as elastic modulus,\neffective normal stress, penetration hardness and friction. Model prediction of\nNTV frequency content is consistent with observations. In the framework of this\nmodel it is possible to explain the complicated pattern of tremor migration,\nincluding rapid tremor propagation and reverse tremor migration. Migration\nalong the strike direction is associated with movement of the slip pulse. Rapid\ntremor propagation in the slip-parallel direction is associated with movement\nof kinks along a 2D slip pulse. A slip pulse, pinned in some places, can\nfragment into several pulses, causing tremor associated with some of these\npulse fragments to move opposite to the main propagation direction. The model\npredicts that the frequency content of tremor during an ETS event is slightly\ndifferent from the frequency content of ambient tremor and tremor triggered by\nearthquakes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 19:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

However, the error in the precession frequency is\nusually increased. 3) A correction function of small magnitude corrects the\nfrequency problem.

However, we show that\nthe expansion due to the removal of the compressive tides is not enough to\nexplain the observed extended structure, since the stellar systems resulting\nfrom this process are always more compact than the corresponding clusters that\nexpand in isolation due to two-body relaxation. We conclude that an accreted\norigin of extended globular clusters is unlikely to explain their large spatial\nextent, and rather favor the hypothesis that such clusters are already extended\nat the stage of their formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 21:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The global\nX-ray emission of the galaxy - dominated by the off-nuclear ULX and nuclear\nsources, which are also likely ULXs - falls steeply (photon index >~ 3) above\n10 keV, consistent with other NuSTAR-observed ULXs, and no significant excess\nabove the background is detected at E > 40 keV.

An\nimportant aspect of these models of other agents is that they are often partial\nand incomplete. Thus far, there are two common representations of agent models:\nMDP based and action based, which are both based on action modeling. In many\napplications, agent models may not have been given, and hence must be learnt.\nWhile it may seem convenient to use either MDP based or action based models for\nlearning, in this paper, we introduce a new representation based on capability\nmodels, which has several unique advantages. First, we show that learning\ncapability models can be performed efficiently online via Bayesian learning,\nand the learning process is robust to high degrees of incompleteness in plan\nexecution traces (e.g., with only start and end states). While high degrees of\nincompleteness in plan execution traces presents learning challenges for MDP\nbased and action based models, capability models can still learn to {\\em\nabstract} useful information out of these traces. As a result, capability\nmodels are useful in applications in which such incompleteness is common, e.g.,\nrobot learning human model from observations and interactions. Furthermore,\nwhen used in multi-agent planning (with each agent modeled separately),\ncapability models provide flexible abstraction of actions. The limitation,\nhowever, is that the synthesized plan is incomplete and abstract.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 23:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-06"}

It has been found that this radio relic has a rather\nflat integrated spectrum at low frequencies that would imply an injection\nspectral index for the electrons that is inconsistent with the flattest allowed\nby the test particle diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). We performed new\nhigh-frequency observations at 2273, 2640, and 4850 MHz.

Our global\nanalysis involves spectroscopic and asteroseismic determinations of stellar\nparameters (e.g., mass and radius) and radial velocity (RV) measurements. Our\nanalyses reveal that KOI-977 is indeed a red giant in the red clump, but its\nestimated radius ($\\gtrsim 20R_\\odot=0.093$ AU) is much larger than\nKOI-977.01's orbital distance ($\\sim 0.027$ AU) estimated from its period\n($P_\\mathrm{orb}\\sim 1.35$ days) and host star's mass.

We present an analytic galaxy\nevolution model that directly constrains such feedback processes from observed\ngalaxy scaling relations. The equilibrium model, which is broadly valid for\nstar-forming central galaxies that dominate cosmic star formation, is based on\nthe ansatz that galaxies live in a slowly-evolving equilibrium between inflows,\noutflows, and star formation. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain\napproach, we constrain our model to match observed galaxy scaling relations\nbetween stellar mass and halo mass, star formation rate, and metallicity from\n0<z<2. A good fit (chi^2~1.6) is achieved with eight free parameters. We\nfurther show that constraining our model to any two of the three data sets also\nproduces a fit to the third that is within reasonable systematic uncertainties.\nThe resulting best-fit parameters that describe baryon cycling suggest galactic\noutflow scalings intermediate between energy and momentum-driven winds, a weak\ndependence of wind recycling time on mass, and a quenching mass scale that\nevolves modestly upwards with redshift. This model further predicts a stellar\nmass-star formation rate relation that is in good agreement with observations\nto z~6.

A critical issue is how the PNC system performs when the\nreceived powers from the two users at the relay are imbalanced. In particular,\nhow would the PNC system perform under slight power imbalance that is\ninevitable in practice, even when power control is applied? To answer these\nquestions, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of q-PAM PNC. Our\ncontributions are as follows: 1) We give a systematic way to obtain the\nanalytical relationship between the minimum distance of the signal\nconstellation induced by the superimposed signals of the two users (a key\nperformance determining factor) and the channel-gain ratio of the two users,\nfor all q. In particular, we show how the minimum distance changes in a\npiecewise linear fashion as the channel-gain ratio varies. 2) We show that the\nperformance of q-PAM PNC is highly sensitive to imbalanced received powers from\nthe two users at the relay, even when the power imbalance is slight (e.g., the\nresidual power imbalance in a power-controlled system). This sensitivity\nproblem is exacerbated as q increases, calling into question the robustness of\nhigh-order modulated PNC. 3) We propose an asynchronized PNC system in which\nthe symbol arrival times of the two users at the relay are deliberately made to\nbe asynchronous. We show that such asynchronized PNC, when operated with a\nbelief propagation (BP) decoder, can remove the sensitivity problem, allowing a\nrobust high-order modulated PNC system to be built.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2014 06:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Bhaumik and Ghosal (2015) considered a Bayesian\ntwo-step approach by embedding the model in a larger nonparametric regression\nmodel, where a prior is put through a random series based on B-spline basis\nfunctions. A posterior on the parameter is induced from the regression function\nby minimizing an integrated weighted squared distance between the derivative of\nthe regression function and the derivative suggested by the ODEs.

It has been demonstrated that atomic\nscale structural defects of graphene can host unpaired spins. However, it is\nstill unclear under which conditions long-range magnetic order can emerge from\nsuch defect-bound magnetic moments. Here we propose that in contrast to random\ndefect distributions, atomic scale engineering of graphene edges with specific\ncrystallographic orientation, comprising edge atoms only from one sub-lattice\nof the bipartite graphene lattice, can give rise to a robust magnetic order.

While armchair ribbons display quantum\nconfinement gap, zigzag ribbons narrower than 7 nm reveal a bandgap of about\n0.2 - 0.3 eV, which can be identified as a signature of interaction induced\nspin ordering along their edges. Moreover, a semiconductor to metal transition\nis revealed upon increasing the ribbon width, indicating the switching of the\nmagnetic coupling between opposite ribbon edges from antiferromagnetic to\nferromagnetic configuration.

The fundamental interactions can be classified as\ntwo-pulse, three-pulse, or four-pulse collisions and they can be either\ncomplete, or incomplete. Each type of collision is shown to have its unique\nsignature and the overall nature of NLIN is determined by the relative\nimportance of the various classes of pulse collisions in a given WDM system.\nThe pulse-collision picture provides qualitative and quantitative insight into\nthe character of NLIN, offering a simple and intuitive explanation to all of\nthe reported and previously unexplained phenomena. In particular, we show that\nthe most important contributions to NLIN follow from two-pulse and four-pulse\ncollisions. While the contribution of two-pulse collisions is in the form of\nphase-noise and polarization-state-rotation with strong dependence on\nmodulation format, four-pulse collisions generate complex circular noise whose\nvariance is independent of modulation format. In addition, two-pulse collisions\nare strongest when the collision is complete, whereas four-pulse collisions are\nstrongest when the collision is incomplete. We show that two-pulse collisions\ndominate the formation of NLIN in short links with lumped amplification, or in\nlinks with distributed amplification extending over arbitrary length. In long\nlinks using lumped amplification the relative significance of four-pulse\ncollisions increases, emphasizing the circularity of the NLIN while reducing\nits dependence on modulation format.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2014 09:49:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2015 07:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-03"}

The theory\nof dormant opers (or more generally, opers in positive characteristic) on\npointed stable curves, which has proved to be rather rich and deep, was born in\nthe work of S. Mochizuki, who developed the theory for $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$-opers\nand used it to establish $p$-adic Teichm\\\"{u}ller theory. Some parts of\nMochizuki's work were later extended in the case of proper smooth curves by K.\nJoshi, C. Pauly, and other mathematicians. This manuscript represents an\nadvance in the theory of opers that takes the subject beyond the work of\nMochizuki, Joshi, and Pauly. In particular, we provide general unified\nformulations and the basics of principal bundles and connections defined on\nfamilies of pointed stable curves. The notion of an oper is accordingly\nintroduced in the context of logarithmic algebraic geometry. Some of the\nresults can be regarded as generalizations of results obtained in the\nfundamental work on the geometric Langlands program developed by A. Beilinson\nand V. Drinfeld. We also describe various properties and assertions about\n(dormant) opers, such as duality, comparison with differential operators, and\ncompactification of the moduli space. Our goal is to give an explicit formula,\nconjectured by Joshi, for the generic number of dormant\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_n$-opers. We do so by obtaining a detailed understanding of the\nmoduli space of dormant opers and computing the Gromov-Witten invariants for\nQuot-schemes in characteristic zero.

Here we finalize the model by finding the correct value of the\npre-factor of the Parikh and Wilczek probability of emission. In fact, that\nexpression has the \"of order\" sign instead of the equality. In general, in this\nkind of leading order tunnelling calculations, the exponent arises indeed from\nthe classical action and the pre-factor is an order Planck constant correction.\nBut in the case of emissions of Hawking quanta, the variation of the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy is order 1 for an emitted particle having energy of\norder the Hawking temperature. As a consequence, the exponent in the Parikh and\nWilczek probability of emission is order unity and one asks what is the real\nsignificance of that scaling if the pre-factor is unknown. Here we solve the\nproblem assuming the unitarity of the black hole (BH) quantum evaporation and\nconsidering the natural correspondence between Hawking radiation and\nquasi-normal modes (QNMs) of excited BHs, in a \"Bohr-like model\" that we\nrecently discussed in a series of papers. In that papers, QNMs are interpreted\nas natural BH quantum levels (the \"electron states\" in the \"Bohr-like model\").\nHere we find the intriguing result that, although in general it is well\napproximated by 1, the pre-factor of the Parikh and Wilczek probability of\nemission depends on the BH quantum level n. We also write down an elegant\nexpression of the probability of emission in terms of the BH quantum levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2014 10:17:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2015 13:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-11"}

The physics of this crossover has\nbeen of considerable interest both in the fields of condensed matter and\nultracold atoms. One of the most challenging issue in this regime is the effect\nof large spin imbalance on a Fermi system under magnetic fields. Although\nseveral exotic physical properties have been predicted theoretically, the\nexperimental realization of such an unusual superconducting state has not been\nachieved so far. Here we show that pure single crystals of superconducting FeSe\noffer the possibility to enter the previously unexplored realm where the three\nenergies, Fermi energy $\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}$, superconducting gap $\\Delta$ and\nZeeman energy, become comparable. Through the superfluid response, transport,\nthermoelectric response, and spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy, we demonstrate that $\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}$ of FeSe is extremely\nsmall, with the ratio $\\Delta/\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}\\sim1 (\\sim0.3)$ in the\nelectron (hole) band. Moreover, thermal-conductivity measurements give evidence\nof a distinct phase line below the upper critical field, where the Zeeman\nenergy becomes comparable to $\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}$ and $\\Delta$. The\nobservation of this field-induced phase provides insights into previously\npoorly understood aspects of the highly spin-polarized Fermi liquid in the\nBCS-BEC crossover regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2014 11:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-13"}

This superconducting fluctuation effect above $T_c$\nhas been investigated for many decades and its influence on the transport,\nthermoelectric and thermodynamic quantities in most superconductors is well\nunderstood by the standard Gaussian fluctuation theories. The transverse\nthermoelectric (Nernst) effect is particularly sensitive to the fluctuations,\nand the large Nernst signal found in the pseudogap regime of the underdoped\nhigh-$T_c$ cuprates has raised much debate on its connection to the origin of\nsuperconductivity. Here we report on the observation of a colossal Nernst\nsignal due to the superconducting fluctuations in the heavy-fermion\nsuperconductor URu$_2$Si$_2$. The Nernst coefficient is enhanced by as large as\none million times over the theoretically expected value within the standard\nframework of superconducting fluctuations. This, for the first time in any\nknown material, results in a sizeable thermomagnetic figure of merit\napproaching unity. Moreover, contrary to the conventional wisdom, the\nenhancement in the Nernst signal is more significant with the reduction of the\nimpurity scattering rate. This anomalous Nernst effect intimately reflects the\nhighly unusual superconducting state embedded in the so-called hidden-order\nphase of URu$_2$Si$_2$.

As briefly discussed\nin [T. Duguet, G. Hagen, Phys. Rev.

Given that ESPEs provide a way to\ninterpret the many-body problem in terms of simpler theoretical ingredients,\nthe goal is to specify the terms, i.e. the exact sense and conditions, in which\nthis interpretation can be conducted meaningfully. State-of-the-art\nmulti-reference in-medium similarity renormalization group and self-consistent\nGorkov Green's function many-body calculations are employed to corroborate the\nformal analysis. This is done by comparing the behavior of several observables\nand of non-observable ESPEs (and spectroscopic factors) under (quasi) unitary\nsimilarity renormalization group transformations of the Hamiltonian\nparameterized by the resolution scale $\\lambda$. The non-observable nature of\nthe nuclear shell structure, i.e. the fact that it constitutes an intrinsically\ntheoretical object with no counterpart in the empirical world, must be\nrecognized and assimilated.

For the interior geometry, a\ngeneral cylindrically symmetric static metric tensor is used with finite\nsupport. In the region outside the core, both the Hadamard function and the\ncurrent density are decomposed into the idealized zero-thickness cosmic string\nand core-induced contributions. The only nonzero component corresponds to the\nazimuthal current. The zero-thickness part of the latter is a periodic function\nof the magnetic flux inside the core, with the period equal to the quantum\nflux. As a consequence of the direct interaction of the quantum field with the\nmagnetic field inside the penetrable core, the core-induced contribution, in\ngeneral, is not a periodic function of the flux.

Feasibility is most closely modeled by a\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) formula, which unfortunately is\nconceptually complicated, being an asymmetric, cumulative, many-to-one\nrelationship. We re-examine how well graphs can capture wireless receptions as\nencoded in SINR relationships, placing them in a framework in order to\nunderstand the limits of such modelling. We seek for each wireless instance a\npair of graphs that provide upper and lower bounds on the feasibility relation,\nwhile aiming to minimize the gap between the two graphs. The cost of a graph\nformulation is the worst gap over all instances, and the price of (graph)\nabstraction is the smallest cost of a graph formulation. We propose a family of\nconflict graphs that is parameterized by a non-decreasing sub-linear function,\nand show that with a judicious choice of functions, the graphs can capture\nfeasibility with a cost of $O(\\log^* \\Delta)$, where $\\Delta$ is the ratio\nbetween the longest and the shortest link length. This holds on the plane and\nmore generally in doubling metrics. We use this to give greatly improved\n$O(\\log^* \\Delta)$-approximation for fundamental link scheduling problems with\narbitrary power control. We explore the limits of graph representations and\nfind that our upper bound is tight: the price of graph abstraction is\n$\\Omega(\\log^* \\Delta)$.

We\nsimulate several thousand mock strong lenses under ground- and space-based\nconditions as arising from the deflection of an exponential disk by a\nforeground de Vaucouleurs light profile whose lensing potential is described by\na Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid. We then fit for the lensed light distribution\nwith sl_fit after having subtracted the foreground light emission off (ideal\ncase) and also after having fitted the deflector's light with galfit. By\nsetting thresholds in the output parameter space, we can decide the\nlens/not-a-lens status of each system. We finally apply our strategy to a\nsample of 517 lens candidates present in the CFHTLS data to test the\nconsistency of our selection approach. The efficiency of the fast modeling\nmethod at recovering the main lens parameters like Einstein radius, total\nmagnification or total lensed flux, is quite comparable under CFHT and HST\nconditions when the deflector is perfectly subtracted off (only possible in\nsimulations), fostering a sharp distinction between the good and the bad\ncandidates. Conversely, for a more realistic subtraction, a substantial\nfraction of the lensed light is absorbed into the deflector's model, which\nbiases the subsequent fitting of the rings and then disturbs the selection\nprocess. We quantify completeness and purity of the lens finding method in both\ncases. This suggests that the main limitation currently resides in the\nsubtraction of the foreground light. Provided further enhancement of the\nlatter, the direct forward modeling of large numbers of galaxy-galaxy strong\nlenses thus appears tractable and could constitute a competitive lens finder in\nthe next generation of wide-field imaging surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2014 13:16:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2015 18:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

On average\nin the UK, 23% of travel time is lost in connections for trips with more than\none mode, and the lack of synchronization decreases very slowly with population\nsize. This lack of synchronization between modes induces differences between\nthe theoretical quickest trip and the `time-respecting' path, which takes into\naccount waiting times at interconnection nodes. We analyse here the statistics\nof these paths on the multilayer, temporal network of the entire, multimodal\nbritish public transportation system. We propose a statistical decomposition --\nthe `anatomy' -- of trips in urban areas, in terms of riding, waiting and\nwalking times, and which shows how the temporal structure of trips varies with\ndistance and allows us to compare different cities. Weaknesses in systems can\nbe either insufficient transportation speed or service frequency, but the key\nparameter controlling their global efficiency is the total number of stop\nevents per hour for all modes. This analysis suggests the need for better\noptimization strategies, adapted to short, long unimodal or multimodal trips.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2014 14:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-06"}

Here we argue that, if links are directed, dependencies\nare twofold. Besides the ordinary tendency of links of different layers to\nalign as the result of `multiplexity', there is also a tendency to anti-align\nas the result of what we call `multireciprocity', i.e. the fact that links in\none layer can be reciprocated by \\emph{opposite} links in a different layer.\nMultireciprocity generalizes the scalar definition of single-layer reciprocity\nto that of a square matrix involving all pairs of layers. We introduce\nmultiplexity and multireciprocity matrices for both binary and weighted\nmultiplexes and validate their statistical significance against maximum-entropy\nnull models that filter out the effects of node heterogeneity. We then perform\na detailed empirical analysis of the World Trade Multiplex (WTM), representing\nthe import-export relationships between world countries in different\ncommodities. We show that the WTM exhibits strong multiplexity and\nmultireciprocity, an effect which is however largely encoded into the degree or\nstrength sequences of individual layers. The residual effects are still\nsignificant and allow to classify pairs of commodities according to their\ntendency to be traded together in the same direction and/or in opposite ones.\nWe also find that the multireciprocity of the WTM is significantly lower than\nthe usual reciprocity measured on the aggregate network. Moreover, layers with\nlow (high) internal reciprocity are embedded within sets of layers with\ncomparably low (high) mutual multireciprocity. This suggests that, in the WTM,\nreciprocity is inherent to groups of related commodities rather than to\nindividual commodities.

At least above the gas disk, the\nmagnetic fluctuations which resonantly scatter the cosmic rays are\nselfconsistently excited as Alf{`e}n waves by the escaping cosmic rays. The\nfluctuation amplitudes remain finite through nonlinear wave dissipation. The\nspatially increasing speed of the resulting outflow results in a\ndiffusion-convection boundary whose position depends on particle momentum. It\nreplaces the escape boundary of static diffusion models. New effects like\noverall Galactic mass and angular momentum loss as well as gas heating beyond\nthe disk appear.

This paper presents the\ntools for such automatic aberration detection offered by the R package\nsurveillance. We introduce the functionality for the visualization, modelling\nand monitoring of surveillance time series. With respect to modelling we focus\non univariate time series modelling based on generalized linear models (GLMs),\nmultivariate GLMs, generalized additive models and generalized additive models\nfor location, shape and scale. This ranges from illustrating implementational\nimprovements and extensions of the well-known Farrington algorithm, e.g, by\nspline-modelling or by treating it in a Bayesian context. Furthermore, we look\nat categorical time series and address overdispersion using beta-binomial or\nDirichlet-Multinomial modelling. With respect to monitoring we consider\ndetectors based on either a Shewhart-like single timepoint comparison between\nthe observed count and the predictive distribution or by likelihood-ratio based\ncumulative sum methods. Finally, we illustrate how surveillance can support\naberration detection in practice by integrating it into the monitoring workflow\nof a public health institution.

In this paper we present a C++ library,\ni.e. the Multiscale Universal Interface (MUI), which is capable of facilitating\nthe coupling effort for a wide range of multiscale simulations. The library\nadopts a header-only form with minimal external dependency and hence can be\neasily dropped into existing codes. A data sampler concept is introduced,\ncombined with a hybrid dynamic/static typing mechanism, to create an easily\ncustomizable framework for solver-independent data interpretation. The library\nintegrates MPI MPMD support and an asynchronous communication protocol to\nhandle inter-solver information exchange irrespective of the solvers' own MPI\nawareness. Template metaprogramming is heavily employed to simultaneously\nimprove runtime performance and code flexibility. We validated the library by\nsolving three different multiscale problems, which also serve to demonstrate\nthe flexibility of the framework in handling heterogeneous models and solvers.\nIn the first example, a Couette flow was simulated using two concurrently\ncoupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of different spatial\nresolutions.

Through a\nmicrocanonical analysis of the aggregation of IAPP_{20-29} isoforms, we show\nthat a minimalist one-bead hydrophobic-polar continuum model for protein\ninteractions properly quantifies those propensities from free-energy barriers.\nOur results highlight the central role of sequence-dependent hydrophobic\nmutations on hot spots for stabilization, and so for the engineering, of such\nbiological peptides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2014 11:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-27"}

As a result there is no clear\nprescription as to which boundary conditions should be selected in order to\nobtain physically-relevant results pertaining to confined higher spin fields.\nThis lack of understanding is significant given that boundary-dependent\nphenomena are ubiquitous across physics, a prominent example being the Casimir\neffect. Here, we use the two-spinor calculus formalism to present a unified\ntreatment of boundary conditions routinely employed in the treatment of\nspin-1/2 and spin-1 fields. We then use this unification to obtain a boundary\ncondition that can be applied to massless fields of any spin, including the\nspin-2 graviton, and its supersymmetric partner the spin-3/2 gravitino.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 18:24:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 May 2015 09:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-15"}

For instance, although agent having\ncurrently a maximal value of the spin advises his nearest neighbors to buy some\nstocks he, perfidiously, will sell some stocks in the next Monte Carlo step or\nwill occupy a neutral position. In general, the trader has three possibilities:\nhe can buy some stocks if his opinion change within a single time step is\npositive, sell some stocks if this change is negative, or remain inactive if\nhis opinion is unchanged.
