We first study the problem in the setting of PCF,\na typed, core functional language and contribute the first relatively complete\nmethod for constructing counterexamples for PCF programs. The method is\nrelatively complete in the sense of Hoare logic; completeness is reduced to the\ncompleteness of a first-order solver over the base types of PCF. In practice,\nthis means an SMT solver can be used for the effective, automated generation of\nhigher-order counterexamples for a large class of programs.\n  We achieve this result by employing a novel form of symbolic execution for\nhigher-order programs. The remarkable aspect of this symbolic execution is that\neven though symbolic higher-order inputs and values are considered, the path\ncondition remains a first-order formula. Our handling of symbolic function\napplication enables the reconstruction of higher-order counterexamples from\nthis first-order formula.\n  After establishing our main theoretical results, we sketch how to apply the\napproach to untyped, higher-order, stateful languages with first-class\ncontracts and show how counterexample generation can be used to detect contract\nviolations in this setting. To validate our approach, we implement a tool\ngenerating counterexamples for erroneous modules written in Racket.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 16:44:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 17:18:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-22"}

We\nfind that in order to understand the structure of dark matter halos and to make\n~1% accurate predictions for density profiles, one needs to realize that halo\nconcentration is more complex than the traditional ratio of the virial radius\nto the core radius in the NFW profile. For massive halos the averge density\nprofile is far from the NFW shape and the concentration is defined by both the\ncore radius and the shape parameter alpha in the Einasto approximation.\nCombining results from different redshifts, masses and cosmologies, we show\nthat halos progress through three stages of evolution. (1) They start as rare\ndensity peaks that experience very fast and nearly radial infall. This radial\ninfall brings mass closer to the center producing a high concentrated halo.\nHere, the halo concentration increases with the increasing halo mass and the\nconcentration is defined by the alpha parameter with nearly constant core\nradius. Later halos slide into (2) the plateau regime where the accretion\nbecomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even the central region.\nNow the concentration does not depend on halo mass.

First, while average pooling and max pooling have long been the\nstandard approaches to aggregating frame level static features, we show that\nperformance can be significantly improved by taking advantage of an appropriate\nencoding method. Second, we propose using a set of latent concept descriptors\nas the frame descriptor, which enriches visual information while keeping it\ncomputationally affordable. The integration of the two contributions results in\na new state-of-the-art performance in event detection over the largest video\ndatasets. Compared to improved Dense Trajectories, which has been recognized as\nthe best video representation for event detection, our new representation\nimproves the Mean Average Precision (mAP) from 27.6% to 36.8% for the TRECVID\nMEDTest 14 dataset and from 34.0% to 44.6% for the TRECVID MEDTest 13 dataset.\nThis work is the core part of the winning solution of our CMU-Informedia team\nin TRECVID MED 2014 competition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 18:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

However, the standard techniques of Compressive Sensing as applied in\nradar imaging hardly considers the clustering tendency into account while\nreconstructing the image from the compressed measurements. If the group\nsparsity is taken into account, it is intuitive that one might obtain better\nresults both in terms of accuracy and time complexity as compared to the\nconventional recovery techniques like Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). In\norder to remedy this, techniques like Block OMP have been used in the existing\nliterature. An alternate approach is via reconstructing the signal by\ntransforming into the Hough Transform Domain where they become point-wise\nsparse. However, these techniques essentially assume specific size and\nstructure of the groups and are not always effective if the exact\ncharacteristics of the groups are not known, prior to reconstruction. In this\nmanuscript, a novel framework that we call locally adapting matching pursuit\n(LAMP) have been proposed for efficient reconstruction of group sparse signals\nfrom compressed measurements without assuming any specific size, location, or\nstructure of the groups. The recovery guarantee of the LAMP and its superiority\ncompared to the existing algorithms has been established with respect to\naccuracy, time complexity and flexibility in group size.

We estimated proportions, risks, and numbers of deaths (with\nuncertainty) for programme-relevant causes of neonatal death for 194 countries\nfor 2000-2013, differentiating between the early (days 0-6) and late (days\n7-27) neonatal periods.\n  Methods: For 65 high-quality VR countries, we used the observed early and\nlate neonatal proportional cause distributions. For the remaining 129\ncountries, we used multinomial logistic models to estimate the early and late\nproportional cause distributions. We used separate models, with different\ninputs, for low and high neonatal mortality countries. We applied these\ncause-specific proportions to neonatal death estimates from the United Nations\nby country/year to estimate cause-specific risks and numbers of deaths.\n  Findings: Of the 2.76 million neonatal deaths in 2013, 0.99 (uncertainty:\n0.70-1.31) million (35.7%) were estimated to be from preterm complications,\n0.64 (uncertainty: 0.46-0.84) million (23.4%) from intrapartum-related\ncomplications, and 0.43 (0.22-0.66) million (15.6%) from sepsis.

If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size,\nthe algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with\nthe input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as\napplied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular\nand 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum\nalgorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the\noptimal cut.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 19:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

Tunneling has been hypothesized\nas an advantageous physical resource for optimization. Here we present the\nfirst experimental evidence of a computational role of multiqubit quantum\ntunneling in the evolution of a programmable quantum annealer. We develop a\ntheoretical model based on a NIBA Quantum Master Equation to describe the\nmultiqubit dissipative tunneling effects under the complex noise\ncharacteristics of such quantum devices. We start by considering a\ncomputational primitive, an optimization problem consisting of just one global\nand one false minimum. The quantum evolutions enable tunneling to the global\nminimum while the corresponding classical paths are trapped in a false minimum.\nIn our study the non-convex potentials are realized by frustrated networks of\nqubit clusters with strong intra-cluster coupling. We show that the collective\neffect of the quantum environment is suppressed in the \"critical\" phase during\nthe evolution where quantum tunneling \"decides\" the right path to solution. In\na later stage dissipation facilitates the multiqubit tunneling leading to the\nsolution state. The predictions of the model accurately describe the\nexperimental data from the D-Wave Two quantum annealer at NASA Ames. In our\ncomputational primitive the temperature dependence of the probability of\nsuccess in the quantum model is opposite to that of the classical paths with\nthermal hopping.

SCBs are often observed in the intimidate\nvicinity of erupting flares and are associated with coronal mass ejections. In\nthe past decade there have been several previous investigations of SCBs. These\nstudies have exclusively relied upon H-alphaimages to discover and analyze\nthese ephemeral brightenings. This work employs the automated detection\nalgorithm of Kirk et al. (2011) to extract the physical qualities of SCBs in\nobservations of ground-based H-alpha images and complementary AIA images in\nHeII, Civ, and 1700 \\AA. The meta-data produced in this tracking process are\nthen culled using complementary Doppler velocities to isolate three\ndistinguishable types of SCBs. From a statistical analysis, we find that the\nSCBs at the chromospheric H-alpha layer appear earlier, and last longer than\ntheir corresponding signatures measured in AIA. From this multi-layer analysis,\nwe infer that SCBs are spatially constrained to the mid-chromosphere. We also\nderive an energy budget to explain SCBs in which SCBs have a postulated energy\nof not more than 0.01% of the total flare energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 22:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

However, the underlying\nmechanism that drives real networks to be navigable is not yet well understood.\nIn this paper, we present a game theoretic model for the formation of navigable\nsmall world networks. We model the network formation as a Distance-Reciprocity\nBalanced (DRB) game in which people seek for both high reciprocity and\nlong-distance relationships. We show that the game has only two Nash\nequilibria: One is the navigable small-world network, and the other is the\nrandom network in which each node connects with each other node with equal\nprobability. We further show that the navigable small world is very stable ---\n(a) no collusion of any size would benefit from deviating from it; and (b)\nafter an arbitrary deviations of a large random set of nodes, the network would\nreturn to the navigable small world as soon as every node takes one\nbest-response step. In contrast, for the random network, a small group\ncollusion or random perturbations is guaranteed to move the network to the\nnavigable network as soon as every node takes one best-response step. Moreover,\nwe show that navigable small world has much better social welfare than the\nrandom network, and provide the price-of-anarchy and price-of-stability results\nof the game. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the system always\nconverges to the navigable network even when limited or no information about\nother players' strategies is available, and the DRB game simulated on the\nreal-world network leads to navigability characteristic that is very close to\nthat of the real network.

This paper concerns solving this kind of optimization problem in a\ndistributed manner while protecting the privacy of user information. Without\nprivacy considerations, existing distributed algorithms normally consist in a\ncentral entity computing and broadcasting certain public coordination signals\nto participating users. However, the coordination signals often depend on user\ninformation, so that an adversary who has access to the coordination signals\ncan potentially decode information on individual users and put user privacy at\nrisk. We present a distributed optimization algorithm that preserves\ndifferential privacy, which is a strong notion that guarantees user privacy\nregardless of any auxiliary information an adversary may have. The algorithm\nachieves privacy by perturbing the public signals with additive noise, whose\nmagnitude is determined by the sensitivity of the projection operation onto\nuser-specified constraints. By viewing the differentially private algorithm as\nan implementation of stochastic gradient descent, we are able to derive a bound\nfor the suboptimality of the algorithm. We illustrate the implementation of our\nalgorithm via a case study of electric vehicle charging. Specifically, we\nderive the sensitivity and present numerical simulations for the algorithm.\nThrough numerical simulations, we are able to investigate various aspects of\nthe algorithm when being used in practice, including the choice of step size,\nnumber of iterations, and the trade-off between privacy level and\nsuboptimality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Nov 2014 02:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The sample comprises 38 SEP events associated with strong\nSXR bursts (classes M and X) in the western solar hemisphere between 1997 and\n2006, and where the flare-related particle acceleration is accompanied by radio\nbursts indicating electron escape to the interplanetary space.

The classical correlation analysis\nshows the usual picture of correlations with broad scatter between SEP peak\nintensities and the different parameters of solar activity, and strong\ncorrelations between the solar activity parameters themselves. The partial\ncorrelation analysis shows that the only parameters that affect significantly\nthe SEP intensity are the CME speed and the SXR fluence.

The proposed scheme can achieve the\ncapacity-approaching performance of the classical linear precoding schemes in\nan iterative way without complicated matrix inversion, which can reduce the\noverall complexity by one order of magnitude.

Consider the downlink of a cloud-radio access network (C-RAN), where\nthe cloud is only responsible for the scheduling policy and the synchronization\nof the transmit frames across the connected base-stations (BS). The transmitted\nframe of every BS consists of several time/frequency blocks, called power-zones\n(PZ), maintained at fixed transmit power. The paper considers the problem of\nscheduling users to PZs and BSs in a coordinated fashion across the network, by\nmaximizing a network-wide utility under the practical constraint that each user\ncannot be served by more than one base-station, but can be served by one or\nmore power-zone within each base-station frame. The paper solves the problem\nusing a graph theoretical approach by introducing the scheduling graph in which\neach vertex represents an association of users, PZs and BSs. The problem is\nformulated as a maximum weight clique, in which the weight of each vertex is\nthe benefit of the association represented by that vertex.

We investigate the evolution of fast\nmagnetoacoustic pulses in randomly structured plasmas, in the context of\nlarge-scale propagating waves in the solar atmosphere. We perform one\ndimensional numerical simulations of fast wave pulses propagating perpendicular\nto a constant magnetic field in a low-$\\beta$ plasma with a random density\nprofile across the field. Both linear and nonlinear regimes are considered. We\nstudy how the evolution of the pulse amplitude and width depends on their\ninitial values and the parameters of the random structuring. A randomly\nstructured plasma acts as a dispersive medium for a fast magnetoacoustic pulse,\ncausing amplitude attenuation and broadening of the pulse width. After the\npassage of the main pulse, secondary propagating and standing fast waves appear\nin the plasma. Width evolution of both linear and nonlinear pulses can be well\napproximated by linear functions; however, narrow pulses may have zero or\nnegative broadening. This arises because a narrow pulse is prone to splitting,\nwhile a broad pulse usually deviates less from their initial Gaussian shape and\nform ripple structures on top of the main pulse. A linear pulse decays at\nalmost a constant rate, while a nonlinear pulse decays exponentially. A pulse\ninteracts most efficiently with a random medium which has a correlation length\nof about half of its initial pulse width. The development of a detailed model\nof a fast MHD pulse propagating in highly structured medium substantiates the\ninterpretation of EIT waves as fast magnetoacoustic waves. Evolution of a fast\npulse provides us with a novel method to diagnose the sub-resolution\nfilamentation of the solar atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Nov 2014 14:47:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Simulation in both artificial and real networks shows that the\nperformance of the ranking algorithms can be improved when the projected\nratings are used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Nov 2014 15:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

This paper first demonstrates a useable map that allows\nBloch-sphere rotations to be represented as quaternionic multiplications,\nsimplifying the form of the dynamical equations. Left-multiplications generally\ncorrespond to non-unitary transformations, providing a simpler (essentially\nclassical) analysis of time-reversal. But the quaternion viewpoint also reveals\na surprisingly large broken symmetry, as well as a potential way to restore it,\nvia a natural expansion of the state space that has parallels to second order\nfermions. This expansion to \"second order qubits\" would imply either a larger\ngauge freedom or a natural space of hidden variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Nov 2014 21:28:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2015 02:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-11"}

The minimum (or average) dwell time that guarantees the\nasymptotic stability can be computed by calculating the maximum cycle ratio (or\nmaximum cycle mean) of a doubly weighted digraph where weights depend on the\neigenvalues and eigenvectors of subsystem matrices. The graph-based method is\napplied to systems with defective subsystem matrices using Jordan\ndecomposition.
