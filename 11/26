It is an interesting time to review what we know (and don't know)\nabout them both empirically and theoretically. These compact sources involving\nline emitting plasma show extraordinary luminosities extending to one thousand\ntimes that of our Milky Way in emitting volumes of a few solar system diameters\n(bolometric luminosity log L$_{bol} \\sim $ 44-48 [erg s$^{-1}$]: D=1-3 light\nmonths $\\sim$ $10^3$ - $10^4$ gravitational radii). The advent of 8-10 meter\nclass telescopes enables us to study them spectroscopically in ever greater\ndetail.\n  In 2000 we introduced a 4D Eigenvector 1 parameters space involving optical,\nUV and X-Ray measures designed to serve as a 4D equivalent of the 2D\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram so important for depicting the diversity of stellar\ntypes and evolutionary states. This diagram has revealed a principal sequence\nof quasars distinguished by Eddington ratio (proportional to the accretion rate\nper unit mass). Thus while stellar differences are primarily driven by the mass\nof a star, quasar differences are apparently driven by the ratio of\nluminosity-to-mass.\n  Out of this work has emerged the concept of two quasars populations A and B\nseparated at Eddington ratio around 0.2 which maximizes quasar multispectral\ndifferences. The mysterious 8% of quasars that are radio-loud belong to\npopulation B which are the lowest accretors with the largest black hole masses.\nFinally we consider the most extreme population A quasars which are the highest\naccretors and in some cases are among the youngest quasars. We describe how\nthese sources might be exploited as standard candles for cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 16:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

These experimental\nobservations are in very good agreement with our DFT calculations which\nreproduce the induced lattice distortion and which reveal (through a Bader\nanalysis) that the increase of the interface Mg concentration results in an\nelectron transfer from Mg to Ag atoms of the metallic interface layer. Although\nthe local lattice distortion appears as a consequence of the attractive\n(repulsive) Coulomb interaction between O2- ions of the MgO interface layer and\nthe nearest positively (negatively) charged Mg (Ag) neighbors of the metallic\ninterface layer, its effect on the work function reduction is only limited.\nFinally, an analysis of the induced work function changes in terms of charge\ntransfer, rumpling, and electrostatic compression contributions is attempted\nand reveals that the metal/oxide work function changes induced by interface Mg\natoms incorporation are essentially driven by the increase of the electrostatic\ncompression effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 16:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

In this paper, we explore whether the\nedge-ES correspondence extends to nonchiral topological phases. Specifically,\nwe consider the Wen-plaquette model which has Z_2 topological order. The\nunperturbed model displays an exact correspondence: both the edge and\nentanglement spectra within each topological sector a (a = 1,...,4) are flat\nand equally degenerate. Here, we show, through a detailed microscopic\ncalculation, that in the presence of generic local perturbations: (i) the\neffective degrees of freedom for both the physical edge and the entanglement\ncut consist of a spin-1/2 chain, with effective Hamiltonians H_edge^a and\nH_ent.^a, respectively, both of which have a Z_2 symmetry enforced by the bulk\ntopological order; (ii) there is in general no match between their low energy\nspectra, that is, there is no edge-ES correspondence. However, if supplement\nthe Z_2 topological order with a global symmetry (translational invariance\nalong the edge/cut), i.e. by considering the Wen-plaquette model as a symmetry\nenriched topological phase (SET), then there is a finite domain in Hamiltonian\nspace in which both H_edge^a and H_ent.^a realize the critical Ising model,\nwhose low-energy effective theory is the c = 1/2 Ising CFT.

In comparison, less attention has been devoted to the study of\ninertial non-vacuum states when viewed from the Rindler frame. We provide a\ncomprehensive study of this issue in this paper. We first present a general\nformalism describing characterization of an arbitrary inertial state when\ndescribed using (i) an arbitrary foliation and (ii) the response of UDD moving\nalong an arbitrary trajectory. We use this formalism to explicitly compute the\nresults for the Rindler frame and uniformly accelerated detectors. Any\narbitrary inertial state will always have a thermal component in the Rindler\nframe with additional contributions arising from the non-vacuum nature of the\ninertial state. We classify the nature of the additional contributions in terms\nof functions characterizing the inertial state. We establish that for all\nphysically well behaved normalizable inertial states, the correction terms\ndecay with the energy of the Rindler mode so that the high frequency limit is\ndominated by the thermal noise. However, inertial states which are not strictly\nnormalizable, lead to a constant contribution at all high frequencies in the\nRindler frame. A similar behavior arises in the response of the UDD as well. In\nthe case of the detector response, we provide a physical interpretation for the\nconstant contribution at high frequencies in terms of total detection rate of\nco-moving inertial detectors. We discuss two different approaches for defining\na transition rate for the UDD, when the two-point function lacks the time\ntranslation invariance and discuss several features of different definitions of\ntransition rates.

And (ii) finite 2-loop\ndiagrams, which correspond to the 1-loop generation of some particular vertex\nappearing in a given 1-loop neutrino mass model, thus being effectively 2-loop.\nFrom the large list of all possible 2-loop diagrams, the vast majority are\ninfinite corrections to lower order neutrino mass models and only a moderately\nsmall number of diagrams fall into these two interesting classes. Moreover, all\ndiagrams in class (i) are just variations of three basic diagrams, with\nexamples discussed in the literature before. Similarly, we also show that class\n(ii) diagrams consists of only variations of these three plus two more basic\ndiagrams.

On the other hand, the magnetic field\nvariation has a greater effect on the eigenfunction of the first overtone than\nthe density stratification does for this case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2014 03:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Reduction of couplings became physicswise truely\ninteresting and phenomenologically important when applied to the standard model\nand its possible extensions. In particular in the context of supersymmetric\ntheories it became the most powerful tool known today once it was learned how\nto apply it also to couplings having dimension of mass and to mass parameters.\nTechnically this all relies on the basic property that reducing couplings is a\nrenormalization scheme independent procedure.

It was also used in the widely used HyperLogLog algorithm of\nFlajolet et al.~[AOFA'97] and in large-scale machine learning by Li et\nal.~[NIPS'12] for minwise estimation of set similarity.\n  The main issue of $k$-partition, is that the contents of different bins may\nbe highly correlated when using popular hash functions. This means that methods\nof analyzing the marginal distribution for a single bin do not apply. Here we\nshow that a tabulation based hash function, mixed tabulation, does yield strong\nconcentration bounds on the most popular applications of $k$-partitioning\nsimilar to those we would get using a truly random hash function.

Every proper $k$-coloring of $G$ may be viewed as a homomorphism\n(an edge-preserving vertex mapping) of $G$ to the complete graph of order $k$.\nBy considering homomorphisms of oriented graphs (digraphs without cycles of\nlength at most 2), we get a natural notion of (oriented) colorings and oriented\nchromatic number of oriented graphs. An oriented clique is then an oriented\ngraph whose number of vertices and oriented chromatic number coincide. However,\nthe structure of oriented cliques is much less understood than in the\nundirected case.\n  In this paper, we study the structure of outerplanar and planar oriented\ncliques.

It employs new HTML5 features (such\nas web messaging and web storage) and cryptographic assertions to provide\ndecentralized login, with the intent to respect users' privacy. It can operate\nin a primary and a secondary identity provider mode. While in the primary mode\nBrowserID runs with arbitrary identity providers (IdPs), in the secondary mode\nthere is one IdP only, namely Mozilla's default IdP.\n  We recently proposed an expressive general model for the web infrastructure\nand, based on this web model, analyzed the security of the secondary IdP mode\nof BrowserID. The analysis revealed several severe vulnerabilities.\n  In this paper, we complement our prior work by analyzing the even more\ncomplex primary IdP mode of BrowserID. We do not only study authentication\nproperties as before, but also privacy properties. During our analysis we\ndiscovered new and practical attacks that do not apply to the secondary mode:\nan identity injection attack, which violates a central authentication property\nof SSO systems, and attacks that break an important privacy promise of\nBrowserID and which do not seem to be fixable without a major redesign of the\nsystem. Some of our attacks on privacy make use of a browser side channel that\nhas not gained a lot of attention so far.\n  For the authentication bug, we propose a fix and formally prove in a slight\nextension of our general web model that the fixed system satisfies all the\nrequirements we consider.

A violation of this inequality\nnormally also certifies security of device-independent quantum key\ndistribution, so that an attacker cannot eavesdrop or control the system. Here,\nwe show how this security test can be circumvented in energy-time entangled\nsystems when using standard avalanche photodetectors, allowing an attacker to\ncompromise the system without leaving a trace. With tailored pulses of\nclassical light we reach Bell values up to 3.63 at 97.6% detector efficiency\nwhich is an extreme violation.

The sensitivity of the both stages in the\nevolution of DNS up to the evaporation residue formation to the angular\nmomentum of DNS is studied.

The\nTech-Etch foils show excellent electrical properties with leakage currents\ntypically measured below 1 nA. The geometrical properties of the Tech-Etch\nsingle-mask foils were found to be consistent with one another, and were in\nline with geometrical specifications from previously measured double-mask\nfoils. The single-mask foils displayed good inner and outer hole diameter\nuniformities over the entire active area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2014 14:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-27"}

Energy and momentum conservation is expressed by the first\nmoment of the Boltzmann equation. The system of equations is closed by using\nthe zeroth and second moments of the Boltzmann equation. The\nclose-to-equilibrium matching with second-order viscous hydrodynamics is\ndemonstrated. In particular, I show that the coupling between shear and bulk\npressure corrections, recently proved to be important for an accurate\ndescription of momentum anisotropy and bulk viscous dynamics, does not vanish\nin the close-to-equilibrium limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2014 15:22:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 May 2015 16:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-29"}

As a simple test problem, we consider an initially spherical\ngas cloud in a wind, which is an idealized model for the merger of a subcluster\nor galaxy with a big cluster. Based on an entropy criterion, we calculate the\nmass stripping from the subcluster as a function of time. Moreover, the\nturbulent velocity field is analyzed with a multi-scale filtering technique. We\nfind remarkable differences between the commonly used PPM solver with\ndirectional splitting in the Enzo code and an unsplit variant of PPM in the Nyx\ncode, which demonstrates that different codes can converge to systematically\ndifferent solutions even when using uniform grids. For the test case of an\nunbound cloud, AMR simulations reproduce uniform-grid results for the mass\nstripping quite well, although the flow realizations can differ substantially.\nIf the cloud is bound by a static gravitational potential, however, we find\nstrong sensitivity to spurious fluctuations which are induced at the cutoff\nradius of the potential and amplified by the bow shock. This gives rise to\nsubstantial deviations between uniform-grid and AMR runs performed with Enzo,\nwhile the mass stripping in Nyx simulations of the subcluster is nearly\nindependent of numerical resolution and AMR.
