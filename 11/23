Hence\nthe first CR is also referred to as \"full cognitive radio\". However, due to its\ndifficult implementation, FCC and Simon Haykin separately proposed a much more\nsimplified definition, in which CR mainly detects one single parameter, i.e.,\nspectrum occupancy, and is also called as \"spectrum sensing cognitive radio\".\nWith the rapid development of wireless communication, the infrastructure of a\nwireless system becomes much more complicated while the functionality at every\nnode is desired to be as intelligent as possible, say the self-organized\ncapability in the approaching 5G cellular networks. It is then interesting to\nre-look into Mitola's definition and think whether one could, besides obtaining\nthe \"on/off\" status of the licensed user only, achieve more parameters in a\ncognitive way. In this article, we propose a new cognitive architecture\ntargeting at multiple parameters in future cellular networks, which is a one\nstep further towards the \"full cognition\" compared to the most existing CR\nresearch. The new architecture is elaborated in detailed stages, and three\nrepresentative examples are provided based on the recent research progress to\nillustrate the feasibility as well as the validity of the proposed\narchitecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2014 16:07:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2015 12:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-09"}

Over the last fifteen years this problem has been of\nsignificant interest in the statistics, machine learning, and statistical\nphysics communities, and much of the effort has been directed towards finding\nalgorithms with low computational cost for various restricted classes of\nmodels. Nevertheless, for learning Ising models on general graphs with $p$\nnodes of degree at most $d$, it is not known whether or not it is possible to\nimprove upon the $p^{d}$ computation needed to exhaustively search over all\npossible neighborhoods for each node.\n  In this paper we show that a simple greedy procedure allows to learn the\nstructure of an Ising model on an arbitrary bounded-degree graph in time on the\norder of $p^2$. We make no assumptions on the parameters except what is\nnecessary for identifiability of the model, and in particular the results hold\nat low-temperatures as well as for highly non-uniform models. The proof rests\non a new structural property of Ising models: we show that for any node there\nexists at least one neighbor with which it has a high mutual information. This\nstructural property may be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2014 19:05:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 01:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-02"}

On the other\nhand, the SO-ASAP requires a total of 2*N+1 large-scale computations for\nobtaining all of the first- and second-order sensitivities, for one\nfunctional-type system responses. Therefore, the SO-ASAP should be used when M\nis much larger than N, while the SO-ASAP should be used when N is much larger\nthan M. The original SO-ASAP presented in this work should enable the hitherto\nvery difficult, if not intractable, exact computation of all of the\nsecond-order response sensitivities (i.e., functional Gateaux-derivatives) for\nlarge-systems involving many parameters, as usually encountered in practice.\nVery importantly, the implementation of the SO-ASAP requires very little\nadditional effort beyond the construction of the adjoint sensitivity system\nneeded for computing the first-order sensitivities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2014 19:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The\nillustrative application presented in this work shows that the actual number of\nadjoint computations needed for computing all of the first- and second-order\nresponse sensitivities may significantly less than 2*N+1 per response. For this\nillustrative problem, four (4) large-scale adjoint computations sufficed for\nthe complete and exact computations of all 4 first- and 10 distinct\nsecond-order derivatives. Furthermore, the construction and solution of the\nSASS requires very little additional effort beyond the construction of the\nadjoint sensitivity system needed for computing the first-order sensitivities.\nOnly the sources on the right-sides of the diffusion operator needed to be\nmodified; the left-side of the differential equations remained unchanged. Most\nof the second-order relative sensitivities are just as large as or larger than\nthe first-order ones. We show that the second-order sensitivities cause the\nexpected value of the response to differ from the computed nominal value of the\nresponse; and they contribute decisively to causing asymmetries in the response\ndistribution. Neglecting the second-order sensitivities would nullify the\nthird-order response correlations, and hence would nullify the skewness of the\nresponse; consequently, any events occurring in a response's long and/or short\ntails, which are characteristic of rare but decisive events would likely be\nmissed. We expect the SO-ASAP to affect significantly other fields that need\nefficiently computed second-order response sensitivities, e.g., optimization,\ndata assimilation/adjustment, model calibration, and predictive modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2014 19:34:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The SDA framework\n(designed to be resilient to both insider and outsider attacks) comprises of a\npair-wise key establishment mechanism run along the edges of a data gathering\ntree and a distributed trust evaluation model that is tightly integrated with\nthe data aggregation process itself. If an aggregator node already shares a\nsecret key with its child node, the two nodes locally coordinate to refresh and\nestablish a new pair-wise secret key; otherwise, the aggregator node requests\nthe sink to send a seed-secret key message that is used as the basis to\nestablish a new pair-wise secret key. The trust evaluation model uses the\ntwo-sided Grubbs test to identify outlier data in the periodic beacons\ncollected from the child nodes (neighbor) nodes. Once the estimated trust score\nfor a neighbor node falls below a threshold, the sensor node locally classifies\nits neighbor node as a Compromised or Faulty (CF) node, and discards the data\nor aggregated data received from the CF node. This way, the erroneous data\ngenerated by the CF nodes could be filtered at various levels of the data\ngathering tree and are prevented from reaching the root node (sink node).\nFinally, we assess the effectiveness of our trust evaluation model through a\ncomprehensive simulation study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 03:19:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

Our objective is to formulate and test\ntwo methods addressing this issue, so that the timestep can be chosen based on\naccuracy rather than stability.\n  Both proposed methods extend Rush-Larsen technique, which was originally\ndeveloped to Hogdkin-Huxley type gate models. One method, \"Matrix Rush-Larsen\"\n(MRL) uses a matrix reformulation of the Rush-Larsen scheme, where the matrix\nexponentials are calculated using precomputed tables of eigenvalues and\neigenvectors. The other, \"hybrid operator splitting\" (HOS) method exploits\nasymptotic properties of a particular Markov chain model, allowing explicit\nanalytical expressions for the substeps.\n  We test both methods on the Clancy and Rudy (2002) INa Markov chain model.\nWith precomputed tables for functions of the transmembrane voltage, both\nmethods are comparable to the forward Euler method in accuracy and\ncomputational cost, but allow longer time steps without numerical instability.\n  We conclude that both methods are of practical interest. MRL requires more\ncomputations than HOS, but is formulated in general terms which can be readily\nextended to other Markov Chain channel models, whereas the utility of HOS\ndepends on the asymptotic properties of a particular model.\n  The significance of the methods is that they allow a considerable speed-up of\nlarge-scale computations of cardiac excitation models by increasing the time\nstep, while maintaining acceptable accuracy and preserving numerical stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 08:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

Classical PCA and its variants seek for linear\nprojections of the original variables to obtain a low dimensional feature\nrepresentation with maximal variance. One limitation is that it is very\ndifficult to interpret the results of PCA. In addition, the classical PCA is\nvulnerable to certain noisy data. In this paper, we propose a convex sparse\nprincipal component analysis (CSPCA) algorithm and apply it to feature\nanalysis. First we show that PCA can be formulated as a low-rank regression\noptimization problem. Based on the discussion, the l 2 , 1 -norm minimization\nis incorporated into the objective function to make the regression coefficients\nsparse, thereby robust to the outliers. In addition, based on the sparse model\nused in CSPCA, an optimal weight is assigned to each of the original feature,\nwhich in turn provides the output with good interpretability. With the output\nof our CSPCA, we can effectively analyze the importance of each feature under\nthe PCA criteria. The objective function is convex, and we propose an iterative\nalgorithm to optimize it. We apply the CSPCA algorithm to feature selection and\nconduct extensive experiments on six different benchmark datasets.

We performed deep near\ninfrared imaging with the Subaru 8.2 m telescope, and found two young embedded\nclusters at two CO peaks of Digel Cloud 1 at the kinematic distance of D = 16\nkpc (Galactocentric radius RG = 22 kpc). We identified 18 and 45 cluster\nmembers in the two peaks, and the estimated stellar density are ~ 5 and ~ 3\npc^-2, respectively. The observed K-band luminosity function suggests that the\nage of the clusters is less than 1 Myr and also the distance to the clusters is\nconsistent with the kinematic distance. On the sky, Cloud 1 is located very\nclose to the H I peak of high-velocity cloud (HVC) Complex H, and there are\nsome H I intermediate velocity structures between the Complex H and the\nGalactic disk, which could indicate an interaction between them. We suggest\npossibility that Complex H impacting on the Galactic disk has triggered star\nformation in Cloud 1 as well as the formation of Cloud 1 molecular cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2014 18:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In generalized epidemics the available data are of variable quality\namong countries and limited mainly to trends in the prevalence of HIV among\nwomen attending ante-natal clinics. In concentrated epidemics one needs, at the\nvery least, time trends in the prevalence of HIV among different risk groups,\nincluding intravenous drug users, men-who-have-sex-with-men, and commercial sex\nworkers as well as the size of each group and the degree of overlap between\nthem. Here we focus on the comparatively straight forward problems presented by\ngeneralized epidemics. We fit data from Kenya to a susceptible-infected model\nand then successively add structure to the model, drawing on our knowledge of\nthe natural history of HIV, to explore the effect that different structural\naspects of the model have on the fits and the projections.\n  Both heterogeneity in risk and changes in behaviour over time are important\nbut easily confounded. Using a Weibull rather than exponential survival\nfunction for people infected with HIV, in the absence of treatment, makes a\nsignificant difference to the estimated trends in incidence and mortality and\nto the projected trends. Allowing for population growth has a small effect on\nthe fits and the projections but is easy to include. Including details of the\ndemography adds substantially to the complexity of the model, increases the run\ntime by several orders of magnitude, but changes the fits and projections only\nslightly and to an extent that is less than the uncertainty inherent in the\ndata. We make specific recommendations for the kind of model that would be\nsuitable for understanding and managing HIV epidemics in east and southern\nAfrica.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2014 20:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}
