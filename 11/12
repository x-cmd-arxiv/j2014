Inspired by these observations,\nwe propose a computational model for slightly-supervised object detection,\nbased on prior knowledge modelling, exemplar learning and learning with video\ncontexts. The prior knowledge is modeled with a pre-trained Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN). When very few instances of a new concept are given, an\ninitial concept detector is built by exemplar learning over the deep features\nfrom the pre-trained CNN. Simulating the baby's interaction with physical\nworld, the well-designed tracking solution is then used to discover more\ndiverse instances from the massive online unlabeled videos. Once a positive\ninstance is detected/identified with high score in each video, more variable\ninstances possibly from different view-angles and/or different distances are\ntracked and accumulated. Then the concept detector can be fine-tuned based on\nthese new instances. This process can be repeated again and again till we\nobtain a very mature concept detector. Extensive experiments on Pascal\nVOC-07/10/12 object detection datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour framework. It can beat the state-of-the-art full-training based\nperformances by learning from very few samples for each object category, along\nwith about 20,000 unlabeled videos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 16:00:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 13:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 May 2015 02:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-05"}

All such methods are based on the principle of\nreactive listening of periodic \"fire\" or \"pulse\" broadcasts: each node updates\nthe time of its fire message broadcasts based on received fire messages from\nsome of the remaining nodes sharing the given spectrum. In this paper, we\npresent a novel framework to estimate the required iterations for convergence\nto fair TDMA scheduling. Our estimates are fundamentally different from\nprevious conjectures or bounds found in the literature as, for the first time,\nconvergence to TDMA is defined in a stochastic sense. Our analytic results\napply to the Desync algorithm and to pulse-coupled oscillator algorithms with\ninhibitory coupling. The experimental evaluation via iMote2 TinyOS nodes (based\non the IEEE 802.15.4 standard) as well as via computer simulations demonstrates\nthat, for the vast majority of settings, our stochastic model is within one\nstandard deviation from the experimentally-observed convergence iterations. The\nproposed estimates are thus shown to characterize the desynchronization\nconvergence iterations significantly better than existing conjectures or\nbounds. Therefore, they contribute towards the analytic understanding of how a\ndesynchronization-based system is expected to evolve from random initial\nconditions to the desynchronized steady state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 16:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In this paper we determine the effect of\nstochastic reacceleration on the spectra of electrons in the GeV band and at\nlower energies, and we investigate whether or not reacceleration can explain\nthe observed variation of radio spectral indices. We explicitely calculate the\nmomentum diffusion coefficient for 3 types of turbulence expected downstream of\nthe forward shock: fast-mode waves, small-scale non-resonant modes, and\nlarge-scale modes arising from turbulent dynamo activity. Noting that\nlow-energy particles are efficiently coupled to the quasi-thermal plasma, a\nsimplified cosmic-ray transport equation can be formulated and is numerically\nsolved. Only fast-mode waves can provide momentum diffusion fast enough to\nsignificantly modify the spectra of particles. Using a synchrotron emissivity\nthat accurately reflects a highly turbulent magnetic field, we calculate the\nradio spectral index and find that soft spectra with index $\\alpha\\lesssim\n-0.6$ can be maintained over more than 2 decades in radio frequency, even if\nthe electrons experience reacceleration for only one acceleration time. A\nspectral hardening is possible but considerably more frequency-dependent. The\nspectral modification imposed by stochastic reacceleration downstream of the\nforward shock depends only weakly on the initial spectrum provided by, e.g.,\ndiffusive shock acceleration at the shock itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 17:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-28"}

This is done via the\nPoisson Process Calculus as it now relates to latent feature models. The IBP\nwas ingeniously devised by Griffiths and Ghahramani in (2005) and its\ngenerative scheme is cast in terms of customers entering sequentially an Indian\nBuffet restaurant and selecting previously sampled dishes as well as new\ndishes. In this metaphor dishes corresponds to latent features, attributes,\npreferences shared by individuals. The IBP, and its generalizations, represent\nan exciting class of models well suited to handle high dimensional statistical\nproblems now common in this information age. The IBP is based on the usage of\nconditionally independent Bernoulli random variables, coupled with completely\nrandom measures acting as Bayesian priors, that are used to create sparse\nbinary matrices. This Bayesian non-parametric view was a key insight due to\nThibaux and Jordan (2007). One way to think of generalizations is to to use\nmore general random variables. Of note in the current literature are models\nemploying Poisson and Negative-Binomial random variables. However, unlike their\nclosely related counterparts, generalized Chinese restaurant processes, the\nability to analyze IBP models in a systematic and general manner is not yet\navailable. The limitations are both in terms of knowledge about the effects of\ndifferent priors and in terms of models based on a wider choice of random\nvariables.

Under this semiparametric Gaussian\ncopula setting, we derive an accurate semiparametric estimator of the log\ndensity ratio, which leads to our empirical decision rule and a bound on its\nassociated excess risk. Our estimation procedure takes advantage of the\npotential sparsity as well as the low noise condition in the problem, which\nallows us to achieve faster convergence rate of the excess risk than is\npossible in the existing literature on semiparametric Gaussian copula\nclassification.

Our new spectral energy distribution (SED) includes the\nradio, near-infrared, optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray wavebands. XTE J1118 is\nnow the second BHXB at such a low Eddington ratio with a well-sampled SED,\nproviding new constraints on highly sub-Eddington accretion flows and jets, and\nopening the door for comparison studies. We apply a multi-zone jet model to the\nnew broadband SED, and we compare our results to previous fits to the same\nsource using the same model at 4-5 decades higher luminosity. We find that\nafter a BHXB transitions to the so-called quiescent spectral state, the jet\nbase becomes more compact (by up to an order of magnitude) and slightly cooler\n(by at least a factor of two). Our preferred model fit indicates that jet\nparticle acceleration is weaker after the transition into quiescence. That is,\naccelerated non-thermal particles no longer reach high enough Lorentz factors\nto contribute significant amounts of synchrotron X-ray emission. Instead, the\nX-ray waveband is dominated by synchrotron self-Compton emission from a\npopulation of mildly relativistic electrons with a quasi-thermal velocity\ndistribution associated with the jet base. The corresponding (thermal)\nsynchrotron component emits primarily in the infrared through ultraviolet\nwavebands. Our results on XTE J1118 are consistent with broadband modeling for\nA0620-00 and for Sgr A*. The above could therefore represent a canonical\nbaseline geometry for accreting black holes in quiescence. We conclude with\nsuggestions for future studies to further investigate the above scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 21:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

For weak Raman\ncoupling, increasing attractive spin-dependent interactions (as in $^{87}$Rb or\n$^7$Li) induces a transition from a uniform to a stripe XY ferromagnet (with no\nnematic order).

The dispersion equation that is derived\nleads to an Alfven wave and magnetogasdynamics wave modes whose distribution\nwith respect the direction of the imposed magnetic field varies with the\nrelative speed of the reference frame. For the particular case in which the\nspeed of the reference frame is zero the dispersion equation of the\nmagnetogasdynamic waves reduces to what is known for stationary plasmas. More\ncomplicated waves with different distribution modes with respect to the\nmagnetic field direction are implied from the more general four-order\ndispersion equation that is derived.

In\npractice, however, the sparsity structure may not always be invariant in the\npopulation, due to heterogeneity across different sub-populations. We consider\na general, possibly non-smooth M-estimation framework, allowing a possible\nstructural change regarding the identities of important regressors in the\npopulation.

Moreover these features are usually considered as basic in\nquantum information processing. Nevertheless they raise still unsolved\nproblems, as the objectification problem in the quantum theory of measurement.\nThe extended semantic realism (ESR) model offers a possible way out from these\ndifficulties by embedding the mathematical formalism of QM into a broader\nmathematical formalism and reinterpreting quantum probabilities as conditional\non detection rather than absolute. The embedding allows to recover the formal\napparatus of QM within the ESR model, and the reinterpretation of QM allows to\nconstruct a noncontextual hidden variables theory which justifies the\nassumptions introduced in the ESR model and proves its objectivity. According\nto the ESR model both linear and nonlinear time evolution occur, depending on\nthe physical environment, as in QM. In addition, the ESR model, though\nobjective, implies modified Bell's inequalities that do not conflict with QM,\nsupplies different mathematical representations of proper and improper\nmixtures, provides a general framework in which the local interpretations of\nthe GHZ experiment obtained by other authors are recovered and explained, and\nsupports an interpretation of quantum logic which avoids the introduction of\nthe problematic notion of quantum truth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 04:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-24"}

Theoretical analyses clarify that for two electron singlet\nsystems, the previously proposed time-dependent extended Hartree-Fock (TD-EHF)\nmethod [Phys. Rev. A 51, 3999 (1995)] is equivalent to the multiconfiguration\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock method with two occupied orbitals. The latter\nwavefunction is further transformed into the natural expansion form, enabling\nthe direct propagation of the natural orbitals (NOs). These methods, as well as\nthe conventional time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method, are numerically\nassessed for the description of ionization dynamics of one-dimensional helium\natom model. This numerical analysis (i) explains the reason behind the\nwell-known failure of TDHF method to describe tunneling ionization, (ii)\ndemonstrates the interpretive power of the TD-EHF wavefunction both in the\noriginal nonorthogonal and the NO-based formulations, and (iii) highlights\ndifferent manifestations of the electron correlation (effect beyond the single\ndeterminant description), in tunneling ionization, high harmonic generation,\nand nonsequential double ionization. Possible extensions of the NO basis\napproach to multielectron systems are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 06:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-13"}

One of the open questions in this system is regarding the origin and\nnature of the low-temperature glassy state. In this paper we report on\nmeasurements of higher-order statistics of resistance fluctuations performed in\nepitaxial thin films of SrRuO3 to probe this issue. We observe large\nlow-frequency non-Gaussian resistance fluctuations over a certain temperature\nrange. Our observations are compatible with that of a spin-glass system with\nproperties described by hierarchical dynamics rather than with that of a simple\nferromagnet with a large coercivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 08:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-13"}

In this\nwork, we propose a way to generate a macroscopic $W$-type entangled coherent\nstate using quantum memories in circuit QED. The memories considered here are\nnitrogen-vacancy center ensembles (NVEs), each located in a different cavity.\nThis proposal does not require initially preparing each NVE in a coherent state\ninstead of a ground state, which should significantly reduce its experimental\ndifficulty. For most of the operation time, each cavity remains in a vacuum\nstate, thus decoherence caused by the cavity decay and the unwanted\ninter-cavity crosstalk are greatly suppressed. Moreover, only one\nexternal-cavity coupler qubit is needed. This method is quite general and can\nbe applied to generate the proposed $W$ state with atomic ensembles or other\nspin ensembles distributed in different cavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 08:48:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 06:51:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2015 06:43:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2016 06:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

The sensor that is deployed to monitor the environment\nhas limited energy constraint to the classical quickest change detection\nproblem. We consider the \"censoring\" strategy at the sensor side, i.e., the\nsensor selectively sends its observations to the decision maker. The quickest\nchange detection problem is formulated in a minimax way. In particular, our\ngoal is to find the optimal censoring strategy and stopping time such that the\ndetection delay is minimized subject to constraints on both average run length\n(ARL) and average energy cost before the change.

Similarly to the\nestablished Generalized Linear Least Squares (GLLS) methodology, MOCABA offers\nthe capability to utilize integral experimental data to reduce the prior\nuncertainty of integral observables. The MOCABA approach, however, does not\ninvolve any series expansions and, therefore, does not suffer from the\nbreakdown of first-order perturbation theory for large nuclear data\nuncertainties. This is related to the fact that, in contrast to the GLLS\nmethod, the updating mechanism within MOCABA is applied directly to the\nintegral observables without having to \"adjust\" any nuclear data. A central\npart of MOCABA is the nuclear data Monte Carlo program NUDUNA, which performs\nrandom sampling of nuclear data evaluations according to their covariance\ninformation and converts them into libraries for transport code systems like\nMCNP or SCALE. What is special about MOCABA is that it can be applied to any\nintegral function of nuclear data, and any integral measurement can be taken\ninto account to improve the prediction of an integral observable of interest.\nIn this paper we present two example applications of the MOCABA framework: the\nprediction of the neutron multiplication factor of a water-moderated PWR fuel\nassembly based on 21 criticality safety benchmark experiments and the\nprediction of the power distribution within a toy model reactor containing 100\nfuel assemblies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 13:32:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-08"}

However, the probability of\nfragmentation and the number of fragments seem to be determined to a large\ndegree by the initial conditions. In this work we study the fate of the linear\nperturbations of a homogeneous gas sphere both analytically and numerically. In\nparticular, we investigate the stability of the well-known homologous solution\nthat describes the collapse of a uniform spherical cloud. The difficulty of the\nmathematical singularity in the perturbation equations is surpassed here by\nexplicitly introducing a weak shock next to the sonic point. In parallel, we\nperform adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) numerical simulations of the linear\nstages of the collapse and compared the growth rates obtained by each method.\nWith this combination of analytical and numerical tools, we explore the\nbehavior of both spherically symmetric and non-axisymmetric perturbations. The\nnumerical experiments provide the linear growth rates as a function of the\ncore's initial virial parameter and as a function of the azimuthal wave number\nof the perturbation. The overlapping regime of the numerical experiments and\nthe analytical predictions is the situation of a cold and large cloud, and in\nthis regime the analytically calculated growth rates agree very well with the\nones obtained from the simulations. The use of a weak shock as part of the\nperturbation allows us to find a physically acceptable solution to the\nequations for a continuous range of growth rates. The numerical simulations\nagree very well with the analytical prediction for the most unstable cores,\nwhile they impose a limit of a virial parameter of 0.1 for core fragmentation\nin the absence of rotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 14:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-11"}

Therefore, low-metallicity\nenvironments should promote the formation of Oe stars, including those of\nearlier spectral types than observed in high-metallicity en- vironments. Using\nthe RIOTS4 survey, a spatially complete spectroscopic survey of Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC) field OB stars taken with the IMACS multi-slit spec-\ntrograph at the Magellan Baade Telescope, we identify 25-31 SMC field Oe stars,\nwhich account for 20-28% of SMC field O stars. This fraction is significantly\nhigher than in the MW, where < 10-15% of O stars display the Be phenomenon. We\nalso present 5-7 Oe stars of spectral type ranging from O5.5e to O7e, all\nearlier spectral types than the earliest MW Oe star. These early type Oe stars\nrepresent 20-23% of our SMC Oe stars, a dramatic increase compared to the MW,\nwhere no Oe stars have been identified with these early spectral types. Thus,\nthe higher frequencies of Oe stars and their earlier spectral range in the\nmetal-poor SMC are consistent with the decretion disk model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 14:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-13"}

Recently, however, Den\\'eve and colleagues have suggested that the\nspiking behavior of neurons may be fundamental to how neuronal networks\ncompute, with precise spike timing determined by each neuron's contribution to\nproducing the desired output. By postulating that each neuron fires in order to\nreduce the error in the network's output, it was demonstrated that linear\ncomputations can be carried out by networks of integrate-and-fire neurons that\ncommunicate through instantaneous synapses.

Structural optimizations in the\nstable and saddle point configurations for transfer and reorientation allow\ndescription of the high-temperature classical and semi-classical regimes, in\nwhich diffusion occurs by over-barrier motion. At lower temperature (typically\nbelow 300 K), we describe a thermally-assisted quantum regime. In this regime,\ntransfer and reorientation occur when the surrounding matrix adopts particular\n\"coincidence\" configurations in which quantum tunneling is favored. Both the\nnon-adiabatic and the adiabatic cases are examined. In the adiabatic case, the\nenergy landscape of hydrogen in the coincidence configuration is very flat,\nwith very low coincidence energy barriers. Path-integral molecular dynamics\nsimulations of the H atom in the coincidence potential reveal, in the transfer\ncase, highly quantum behavior up to T=300 K (the density of probability of H in\nthe coincidence configuration, has its maximum at the saddle point, due to the\nfact that the zero-point energy exceeds the coincidence energy barrier).\nArguments are given that support the adiabatic picture for the transfer\nmechanism.

In the case of reorientation, typical times for\nexistence of the coincidence configuration and for protonic motion are roughly\nequal, suggesting that the adiabatic picture is not valid.

Since a major influence on the\ntunneling provides the grid, the electrons emitted from the grid with\napproximately the Fermi velocity, and the calculation of the electron gun with\nmultiple electrodes after the grid is greatly simplified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 11:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

In the mean-field framework, an integral\nexpression for MBDS, which is proper to be performed by asymptotic expansions,\ncan be derived. However, the standard second order steepest descent method\ncannot be applied to this integral when the ground-state is sufficiently\npopulated. Alternatively, we derive a uniform formula for MBDS, which is\npotentially able to deal with this regime. In the case of the one-dimensional\nharmonic oscillator, using results found in the number theory literature, we\nshow that the uniform formula improves the standard expression achieved by\nmeans of the second order method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 15:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

RDS utilizes a peer-driven\nrecruitment mechanism where sampled individuals pass on participation coupons\nto at most $c$ of their acquaintances in the community ($c=3$ being a common\nchoice), who then in turn pass on to their acquaintances if they choose to\nparticipate, and so on. This process of distributing coupons is shown to behave\nlike a new Reed-Frost type network epidemic model, in which becoming infected\ncorresponds to receiving a coupon. The difference from existing network\nepidemic models is that an infected individual can not infect (i.e.\\ sample)\nall of its contacts, but only at most $c$ of them. We calculate $R_0$, the\nprobability of a major \"outbreak\", and the relative size of a major outbreak in\nthe limit of infinite population size and evaluate their adequacy in finite\npopulations. We study the effect of varying $c$ and compare RDS to the\ncorresponding usual epidemic models, i.e.\\ the case of $c=\\infty$. Our results\nsuggest that the number of coupons has a large effect on RDS recruitment.\nAdditionally, we use our findings to explain previous empirical observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 16:11:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}
