The EC is driven by an oscillating\nelectric potential of a sinusoidal form where the phase difference of the\nelectric potential between neighboring electrodes is 180 degrees. We\ninvestigate the one- and two-dimensional nonlinear dynamics of a particle in an\nEC field. The form of the dimensionless equations of motion is codimension two,\nwhere the dimensionless control parameters are the interaction amplitude ($A$)\nand damping coefficient ($\\beta$). Our focus on the one-dimensional EC is\nprimarily on a case of fixed $\\beta$ and relatively small $A$, which is\ncharacteristic of typical experimental conditions.

This paper builds upon a recent\ninformation-theoretic result (using mutual information to measure privacy and\nmean-squared error to measure fidelity) that quantifies the region of\nachievable distortion-leakage tuples in a two-agent network. The objective of\nthis paper is to study centralized and decentralized mechanisms that can enable\nand sustain non-trivial data exchanges among the agents. A centralized\nmechanism determines the data sharing policies that optimize a network-wide\nobjective function combining the fidelities and leakages at both agents. Using\ncommon-goal games and best-response analysis, the optimal policies allow for\ndistributed implementation. In contrast, in the decentralized setting, repeated\ndiscounted games are shown to naturally enable data exchange without any\ncentral control nor economic incentives. The effect of repetition is modeled by\na time-averaged payoff function at each agent which combines its fidelity and\nleakage at each interaction stage. For both approaches, it is shown that\nnon-trivial data exchange can be sustained for specific fidelity ranges even\nwhen privacy is a limiting factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 16:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-28"}

Wireless transmission is in general subject to\ntwo phenomena: fading and interference. The elegant interference alignment\nconcept reveals that with proper transmission signalling design, different\ninterference signals can in fact be aligned together, such that more radio\nresources can be assigned to the desired transmission. Although interference\nalignment can achieve a larger data rate compared to orthogonal transmission\nstrategies, several challenges should be addressed to enable the deployment of\nthis technique in future wireless networks For instance, to perform\ninterference alignment, normally, global channel state information (CSI) is\nrequired to be perfectly known at all terminals.

Specifically, we say that a sketching algorithm is efficient if it\nachieves constant approximation using constant sketch size. A well-known result\nof Indyk (J. ACM, 2006) implies that a metric that admits a constant-distortion\nembedding into $\\ell_p$ for $p\\in(0,2]$ also admits an efficient sketching\nscheme. But is the converse true, i.e., is embedding into $\\ell_p$ the only way\nto achieve efficient sketching?\n  We address these questions for the important special case of normed spaces,\nby providing an almost complete characterization of sketching in terms of\nembeddings. In particular, we prove that a finite-dimensional normed space\nallows efficient sketches if and only if it embeds (linearly) into\n$\\ell_{1-\\varepsilon}$ with constant distortion. We further prove that for\nnorms that are closed under sum-product, efficient sketching is equivalent to\nembedding into $\\ell_1$ with constant distortion. Examples of such norms\ninclude the Earth Mover's Distance (specifically its norm variant, called\nKantorovich-Rubinstein norm), and the trace norm (a.k.a. Schatten $1$-norm or\nthe nuclear norm). Using known non-embeddability theorems for these norms by\nNaor and Schechtman (SICOMP, 2007) and by Pisier (Compositio.

The star formation enhancement during major\nmergers is mild (~20-40%) which, together with the low incidence of such\nevents, implies that this process is not a significant driver of early stellar\nmass growth.

We\nanalyze the assumption at the bases of their formulation and their claim that\nthis returns a lower limit for the local dark matter density, which is accurate\nwithin 20%.

As a consequence, their results are biased and\nlargely overestimate the mass density. Dynamical simulations also show that,\ncontrary to their claims, low values of dV/dR are compatible with a Milky Way\nlike potential with radially constant circular velocity.

In the former, an abundance of resonant chains is\nexpected, which the Kepler data do not support. In the latter, required disk\nmass surface densities may be too high. A recently proposed mechanism\nhypothesizes that planets form in situ at the pressure trap associated with the\ndead-zone inner boundary (DZIB) where radially drifting \"pebbles\" accumulate.\nThis scenario predicts planet masses ($M_p$) are set by the gap-opening process\nthat then leads to DZIB retreat, followed by sequential, inside-out planet\nformation (IOPF). For typical disk accretion rates, IOPF predictions for $M_p$,\n$M_p$ versus orbital radius $r$, and planet-planet separations are consistent\nwith observed systems. Here we investigate the IOPF prediction for how the\nmasses, $M_{p,1}$, of the innermost (\"Vulcan\") planets vary with $r$.

Those hypotheses suggests that crossings\nare likely to reduce when dependencies are shortened. A hypothesis based on\npressure to reduce dependency lengths is more parsimonious than a principle of\nminimization of crossings or a grammatical ban that is totally dissociated from\nthe general and non-linguistic principle of economy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 22:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

This is\nequivalent to solving for $x_i$ in $x = Gx + z$ for some $G$ and $z$ such that\nthe spectral radius of $G$ is less than 1. Our algorithm relies on the Neumann\nseries characterization of the component $x_i$, and is based on residual\nupdates. We analyze our algorithm within the context of a cloud computation\nmodel, in which the computation is split into small update tasks performed by\nsmall processors with shared access to a distributed file system. We prove a\nrobust asymptotic convergence result when the spectral radius $\\rho(|G|) < 1$,\nregardless of the precise order and frequency in which the update tasks are\nperformed. We provide convergence rate bounds which depend on the order of\nupdate tasks performed, analyzing both deterministic update rules via counting\nweighted random walks, as well as probabilistic update rules via concentration\nbounds. The probabilistic analysis requires analyzing the product of random\nmatrices which are drawn from distributions that are time and path dependent.\nWe specifically consider the setting where $n$ is large, yet $G$ is sparse,\ne.g., each row has at most $d$ nonzero entries. This is motivated by\napplications in which $G$ is derived from the edge structure of an underlying\ngraph.

Magnetic anisotropy parameters, vibrational\nenergies, and electron-vibron coupling strengths of the Fe$_4$ are computed\nusing DFT. A giant spin model is applied to the Fe$_4$ with only two charge\nstates, specifically a neutral state with the total spin $S=5$ and a singly\ncharged state with $S=9/2$, which is consistent with our DFT result and\nexperiments on Fe$_4$ single-molecule transistors.

The magnetic anisotropy also introduces vibrational\nsatellite peaks whose position and height are modified with the direction and\nmagnitude of applied B field.

The new features appear\nbecause the magnetic anisotropy barrier is of the same order of magnitude as\nthe energies of vibrational modes with significant electron-vibron coupling.\nOur findings clearly show the interesting interplay between magnetic anisotropy\nand electron-vibron coupling in electron transport via the Fe$_4$.

Construction and navigation of the graph is a space and time bottleneck\nin practice and the main hurdle for assembling large, eukaryote genomes. This\nproblem is compounded by the fact that state-of-the-art assemblers do not build\nthe de Bruijn graph for a single order (value of $K$) but for multiple values\nof $K$. More precisely, they build $d$ de Bruijn graphs, each with a specific\norder, i.e., $G_{K_1}, G_{K_2}, ..., G_{K_d}$. Although, this paradigm\nincreases the quality of the assembly produced, it increases the memory by a\nfactor of $d$ in most cases.

Both these enhanced [N/C] values\nand the C and N anomalies themselves are an obvious evidence of the presence on\na star's surface of mixed material from stellar interiors; so, a majority of\nprogramme stars passed through the deep mixing during the main sequence (MS)\nand/or the first dredge-up (FD) phase. Comparison with theoretical predictions\nincluding rotationally-induced mixing shows that the stars are either post-MS\nobjects with the initial rotational velocities V0 = 200-300 km/s or post-FD\nobjects with V0 = 0-300 km/s. The observed N vs. C anti-correlation reflects a\ndependence of the C and N anomalies on the V0 value: on average the higher V0\nthe greater the anomalies.

Intuitive\ninterpretations of the gradient equations are also provided alongside\nmathematical derivations.\n  In the appendix, a review on the basics of neuron networks and\nbackpropagation is provided. I also created an interactive demo, wevi, to\nfacilitate the intuitive understanding of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 09:24:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 19:33:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2016 21:35:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2016 07:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

An efficient means of locating calibrator sources for International\nLOFAR is developed and used to determine the average density of usable\ncalibrator sources on the sky for subarcsecond observations at 140 MHz.\nMethods. We used the multi-beaming capability of LOFAR to conduct a fast and\ncomputationally inexpensive survey with the full International LOFAR array.\nSources were pre-selected on the basis of 325 MHz arcminute-scale flux density\nusing existing catalogues. By observing 30 different sources in each of the 12\nsets of pointings per hour, we were able to inspect 630 sources in two hours to\ndetermine if they possess a sufficiently bright compact component to be usable\nas LOFAR delay calibrators.

Estimating them from short and noisy\nrecordings poses a long-standing challenge of audio signal processing. In this\npaper we apply a novel strategy based on ideas of Compressed Sensing. Relative\ntransfer function (RTF) corresponding to the relative impulse response can\noften be estimated accurately from noisy data but only for certain frequencies.\nThis means that often only an incomplete measurement of the RTF is available. A\ncomplete RTF estimate can be obtained through finding its sparsest\nrepresentation in the time-domain: that is, through computing the sparsest\namong the corresponding relative impulse responses. Based on this approach, we\npropose to estimate the RTF from noisy data in three steps. First, the RTF is\nestimated using any conventional method such as the non-stationarity-based\nestimator by Gannot et al. or through Blind Source Separation. Second,\nfrequencies are determined for which the RTF estimate appears to be accurate.\nThird, the RTF is reconstructed through solving a weighted $\\ell_1$ convex\nprogram, which we propose to solve via a computationally efficient variant of\nthe SpaRSA (Sparse Reconstruction by Separable Approximation) algorithm. An\nextensive experimental study with real-world recordings has been conducted.

The optical response of these emitters is inherently linked to\ntwo-dimensional properties of the WSe2 monolayer, as they both give rise to\nluminescence in the same energy range, have nearly identical excitation spectra\nand very similar, characteristically large Zeeman effects. With advances in the\nstructural control of edge imperfections, thin films of WSe2 may provide added\nfunctionalities, relevant for the domain of quantum optoelectronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 12:02:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 14:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-14"}

In this\ndevelopment spin pumping, the process where pure spin-currents are generated\nfrom magnetisation precession, has proved to be a powerful method for probing\nspin physics and magnetisation dynamics. The effect originates from direct\nconversion of low energy quantised spin-waves in the magnet, known as magnons,\ninto a flow of spins from the precessing magnet to adjacent normal metal leads.\nThe spin-pumping phenomenon represents a convenient way to electrically detect\nmagnetisation dynamics, however, precessing magnets have been limited so far to\npump pure spin currents, which require a secondary spin-charge conversion\nelement such as heavy metals with large spin Hall angle or multi-layer layouts\nto be detectable. Here, we report the experimental observation of charge\npumping in which a precessing ferromagnet pumps a charge current, demonstrating\ndirect conversion of magnons into high-frequency currents via the relativistic\nspin-orbit interaction. The generated electric current, differently from spin\ncurrents generated by spin-pumping, can be directly detected without the need\nof any additional spin to charge conversion mechanism and amplitude and phase\ninformation about the relativistic current-driven magnetisation dynamics. The\ncharge-pumping phenomenon is generic and gives a deeper understanding of the\nrecently observed spin-orbit torques, of which it is the reciprocal effect and\nwhich currently attract interest for their potential in manipulating magnetic\ninformation. Furthermore, charge pumping provides a novel link between\nmagnetism and electricity and may find application in sourcing alternating\nelectric currents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 12:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-06"}

In systems\nwhich do not display long-range band bending, a satisfactory remedy is offered\nby the use of \"pseudoatoms\", with a fractional nuclear charge matching the bulk\ndoping concentration. However, this alone is not always sufficient for charged\nsurfaces, where the width of the space-charge region (SCR) often exceeds\nrealistic supercell dimensions. One generalization of the pseudoatom approach\nwhich overcomes this difficulty relies on the introduction of an artificially\nhigh doping level within a slab calculation, in conjunction with a multi-scale\nelectrostatic energy correction. Here, we present an alternative technique that\nnaturally extends the pseudoatom approach while bypassing the need for\ncalculations with an unrealistically high doping level. It is based on the\nintroduction of excess charge, mimicking free charge carriers from the SCR,\nalong with a fixed sheet of counter-charge mimicking the SCR-related field.\nSelf-consistency is obtained by imposing charge conservation and Fermi level\nequilibration between the bulk, treated semi-classically, and the electronic\nstates of the slab/surface, which are treated quantum-mechanically. The method,\nwhich we call CREST - the Charge-Reservoir Electrostatic Sheet Technique - can\nbe used with standard electronic structure codes. We validate the approach\nusing a simple tight-binding model, which allows for comparison of its results\nwith calculations encompassing the full SCR explicitly. We then employ it with\ndensity functional theory, where it is used to obtain insights into the\nelectronic structures of the \"clean-cleaved\" Si(111) surface and its buckled\n(2x1) reconstruction, at various doping densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 12:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-17"}

Since they apparently extend into the intergalactic medium, it is\ntantalizing to believe that they have a primordial origin, possibly being\nproduced during inflation. However, finding consistent scenarios for\ninflationary magnetogenesis is a challenging theoretical problem. The\nrequirements to avoid an excessive production of electromagnetic energy, and to\navoid entering a strong coupling regime characterized by large values for the\nelectromagnetic coupling constant, typically allow one to generate only a tiny\namplitude of magnetic field during inflation. We propose a scenario for\nbuilding gauge-invariant models of inflationary magnetogenesis potentially free\nfrom these issues. The idea is to derivatively couple a dynamical scalar, not\nnecessarily the inflaton, to fermionic and electromagnetic fields during the\ninflationary era. Such couplings give additional freedom to control the\ntime-dependence of the electromagnetic coupling constant during inflation. This\nfact allows us to find conditions to avoid the strong coupling problems that\naffect many of the existing models of magnetogenesis. We do not need to rely on\na particular inflationary set-up for developing our scenario, that might be\napplied to different realizations of inflation. On the other hand, specific\nrequirements have to be imposed on the dynamics of the scalar derivatively\ncoupled to fermions and electromagnetism, that we are able to satisfy in an\nexplicit realization of our proposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 13:36:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 10:31:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 16:11:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2015 18:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The two tasks of clustering and\nmatching of the clusters are performed simultaneously within the JCM framework.\nIn this paper, we consider the case where there is a number of distinct classes\nof samples whose class of origin is known, and the problem is to classify a new\nsample of unknown class of origin to one of these predefined classes.

However Shannon's theory of information does not provide\nformulae to fully determine these quantities. Several recent studies have begun\naddressing this. Some possible definitions for PID quantities have been\nproposed, and some analyses have been carried out on systems composed of\ndiscrete variables. Here we present the first in-depth analysis of PIDs on\nGaussian systems, both static and dynamical. We show that, for a broad class of\nGaussian systems, previously proposed PID formulae imply that: (i) redundancy\nreduces to the minimum information provided by either source variable, and\nhence is independent of correlation between sources; (ii) synergy is the extra\ninformation contributed by the weaker source when the stronger source is known,\nand can either increase or decrease with correlation between sources. We find\nthat Gaussian systems frequently exhibit net synergy, i.e. the information\ncarried jointly by both sources is greater than the sum of informations carried\nby each source individually. Drawing from several explicit examples, we discuss\nthe implications of these findings for measures of information transfer and\ninformation-based measures of complexity, both generally and within a\nneuroscience setting. Importantly, by providing independent formulae for\nsynergy and redundancy applicable to continuous time-series data, we open up a\nnew approach to characterizing and quantifying information sharing amongst\ncomplex system variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 14:35:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2015 13:19:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-13"}

This fact motivates the search for\nnew mechanisms for relativistic interactions.

This extends\nideas from zero-range physics to a relativistic setting.

We discuss the QoS features incorporated by the\nIEEE 802.11 standard at both physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC)\nlayers, as well as other higher-layer proposals. We also focus on how the new\narchitectural developments of software-defined networking (SDN) and cloud\nnetworking can be used to facilitate QoS provisioning in IEEE 802.11-based\nnetworks. We conclude this paper by identifying some open research issues for\nfuture consideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 15:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-18"}

These are composed of a quark core and a\nhadronic shell with a first-order phase transition at their interface. The\nresulting mass-radius relations are in accordance with the latest astrophysical\nconstraints. Methods: The quark matter description is based on a quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD) motivated chiral approach with higher-order quark\ninteractions in the Dirac scalar and vector coupling channels. For hadronic\nmatter we select a relativistic mean-field equation of state with\ndensity-dependent couplings. Since the nucleons are treated in the\nquasi-particle framework, an excluded volume correction has been included for\nthe nuclear equation of state at suprasaturation density which takes into\naccount the finite size of the nucleons. Results: These novel aspects, excluded\nvolume in the hadronic phase and the higher-order repulsive interactions in the\nquark phase, lead to a strong first-order phase transition with large latent\nheat, i.e. the energy-density jump at the phase transition, which fulfils a\ncriterion for a disconnected third-family branch of compact stars in the\nmass-radius relationship.

Motivated by this finding, we generalize the stability calculation to\ninclude the quadrupole moment for the host star.

We describe a chirp search method\nwhich steps aside Fourier analysis for signal detection in the Poisson\nnoise-dominated 2 kHz sampled BeppoSAX light curves. An efficient numerical\nimplementation is described in $O(Nn\\log n)$ operations, where $N$ is the\nnumber of chirp templates and $n$ is the length of the light curve time series,\nsuited for embarrassingly parallel processing. For detection of individual\nchirps of duration $\\tau=1$ s, the method is one order of magnitude more\nsensitive in SNR than Fourier analysis. The Fourier-chirp spectra of GRB 010408\nand GRB 970816 show a continuation of the spectral slope up to 1 kHz of\nturbulence identified in low frequency Fourier analysis. The same continuation\nis observed in an ensemble averaged spectrum of 40 bright long GRBs. An outlook\non a similar analysis of upcoming gravitational wave data is included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2014 08:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}
