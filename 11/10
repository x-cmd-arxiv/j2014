For example, our work was motivated by the requirements of many\nsemi-automatic surveillance analytics systems which detect abnormalities in\nclose-circuit television (CCTV) footage using statistical models of low-level\nmotion features. In this paper we specifically address the problem of\nestimating the running quantile of a data stream when the memory for storing\nobservations is limited. We make several major contributions: (i) we highlight\nthe limitations of approaches previously described in the literature which make\nthem unsuitable for non-stationary streams, (ii) we describe a novel principle\nfor the utilization of the available storage space, (iii) we introduce two\nnovel algorithms which exploit the proposed principle in different ways, and\n(iv) we present a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the proposed\nalgorithms and the existing methods in the literature on both synthetic data\nsets and three large real-world streams acquired in the course of operation of\nan existing commercial surveillance system. Our findings convincingly\ndemonstrate that both of the proposed methods are highly successful and vastly\noutperform the existing alternatives. We show that the better of the two\nalgorithms (data-aligned histogram) exhibits far superior performance in\ncomparison with the previously described methods, achieving more than 10 times\nlower estimate errors on real-world data, even when its available working\nmemory is an order of magnitude smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 2014 16:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

After giving a necessary and sufficient condition for a direct sum of\nirreducible affine actions to be irreducible, we show the following\nsuper-rigidity result: if G is product of two or more locally compact groups,\nthen every irreducible affine action of any irreducible co-compact lattice in G\nextends to an affine action of G, provided the linear part of this action does\nnot weakly contain the trivial representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 2014 18:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-02"}

We present the polarization maps of three nearby star forming filament of\nmoderate column density (NH~10^22cm^-2): Musca, B211, and L1506. We use the\nspatial information to separate Stokes I, Q, and U of the filaments from those\nof their backgrounds, an essential step to measure the intrinsic polarization\nfraction (p) and angle (psi) of each emission component. We find that the\npolarization angles in the three filaments (psi_fil) are coherent along their\nlengths and not the same as in their backgrounds (psi_bg). The differences\nbetween psi_fil and psi_bg are 12deg, 6deg, and 54deg for Musca, B211, and\nL1506, respectively. These differences for Musca and L1506 are larger than the\ndispersions of psi, both along the filaments and in their backgrounds. The\nobserved changes of psi are direct evidence for variations of the orientation\nof the plane of the sky (POS) projection of the B-field. As in previous\nstudies, we find a decrease of several percent of p with NH. We show that the\ndrop in p cannot be explained by random fluctuations of the orientation of B\nwithin the filaments because they are too small (sigma_psi<10deg). We recognize\nthe degeneracy between dust alignment efficiency and the structure of B in\ncausing variations in p, but we argue that the decrease of p from the\nbackgrounds to the filaments results in part from depolarization associated\nwith the 3D structure of B: both its orientation in the POS and with respect to\nthe POS. We do not resolve the inner structure of the filaments, but at the\nsmallest scales accessible with Planck (~0.2pc), the observed changes of psi\nand p hold information on the B-field structure within filaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 2014 19:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2015 09:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

The problem of developing lower bounds for data\naccess complexity has been modeled using the formalism of Hong & Kung's\nred/blue pebble game for computational directed acyclic graphs (CDAGs).\nHowever, previously developed approaches to lower bounds analysis for the\nred/blue pebble game are very limited in effectiveness when applied to CDAGs of\nreal programs, with computations comprised of multiple sub-computations with\ndiffering DAG structure.

In this\ninterpretation the electron and the positron are merely the two different\n\"topological spin\" states of a single more fundamental particle, not distinct\nparticles in their own right. The new interpretation is backed up by the\nexistence of such bi-particle structures in general relativity, in particular\nthe ring singularity present in any spacelike section of the maximal\nanalytically extended, topologically non-trivial, electromagnetic Kerr-Newman\nspacetime in the zero-gravity limit (here, \"zero-gravity\" means the limit $G\\to\n0$, where $G$ is Newton's constant of universal gravitation). This novel\ninterpretation resolves the dilemma that Dirac's wave equation seems to be\ncapable of describing both the electron and the positron in \"external\" fields\nin many relevant situations, while the bi-spinorial wave function has only a\nsingle position variable in its argument, not two - as it should if it were a\ntwo-particle equation! A Dirac equation is formulated for a ring-like\nbi-particle which interacts with a static point charges located elsewhere in\nthe topologically non-trivial physical space associated with the moving ring\nbi-particle, the motion being governed by a de-Broglie-Bohm type law extracted\nfrom the Dirac equation. As an application, the pertinent general-relativistic\nzero-gravity Hydrogen problem is studied in the usual Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation. Its spectral results suggest that the zero-$G$ Kerr-Newman\nmagnetic moment be identified with the so-called \"anomalous magnetic moment of\nthe physical electron,\" not with the Bohr magneton, so that the ring radius is\nonly a tiny fraction of the electron's Compton wave length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 2014 23:04:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 May 2015 16:00:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2015 17:58:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 15:05:20 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 02:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-04"}

The conventional data-parallel approach for\ntraining gigantic topic models turns out to be rather inefficient in utilizing\nthe power of parallelism, due to the heavy dependency on a centralized image of\n\"model\". Big model size also poses another challenge on the storage, where\navailable model size is bounded by the smallest RAM of nodes. To address these\nissues, we explore another type of parallelism, namely model-parallelism, which\nenables training of disjoint blocks of a big topic model in parallel.

We also study\nfinite-range effects for the energies of the universal three-identical-bosons\nstates and found a slow approach to universal predictions as a function of the\nscattering length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 04:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

Light curves and images of hot spots orbiting a black\nhole are affected by a number of special and general relativistic effects, and\nthey can be potentially used to check whether the object is a Kerr black hole\nof general relativity.

In particular, the explicit relational\nstructure implies that network data is not i.i.d. data. Network data also often\ncomes with significant metadata (i.e., attributes) associated with each entity\n(node). Moreover, due to the diversity and variation in network data (e.g.,\nmulti-relational links or multi-category entities), various tasks can be\nperformed and often a rich correlation exists between them. Learning algorithms\nshould exploit all of these additional sources of information for better\nperformance. In this work we take a metric-learning point of view for the MTL\nproblem in the network context. Our approach builds on structure preserving\nmetric learning (SPML). In particular SPML learns a Mahalanobis distance metric\nfor node attributes using network structure as supervision, so that the learned\ndistance function encodes the structure and can be used to predict link\npatterns from attributes. SPML is described for single-task learning on single\nnetwork. Herein, we propose a multi-task version of SPML, abbreviated as\nMT-SPML, which is able to learn across multiple related tasks on multiple\nnetworks via shared intermediate parametrization. MT-SPML learns a specific\nmetric for each task and a common metric for all tasks. The task correlation is\ncarried through the common metric and the individual metrics encode task\nspecific information. When combined together, they are structure-preserving\nwith respect to individual tasks. MT-SPML works on general networks, thus is\nsuitable for a wide variety of problems.

Rigid dumbbells and pairs of separate beads starting from the\nsame positions tumble periodically while settling down. We find that elasticity\n(which breaks time-reversal symmetry of the motion) significantly affects the\nsystem's dynamics. This is remarkable taking into account that elastic forces\nare always much smaller than gravity. We observe oscillating motion of the\nelastic dumbbells, which tumble and change their length non-periodically.\nIndependently of the value of the spring constant, a horizontal hydrodynamic\nrepulsion appears between the dumbbells - their centres of mass move apart from\neach other horizontally. The shift is fast for moderate values of the spring\nconstant k, and slows down when k tends to zero or to infinity; in these\nlimiting cases we recover the periodic dynamics reported in the literature. For\nmoderate values of the spring constant, and different initial configurations,\nwe observe the existence of a universal time-dependent solution to which the\nsystem converges after an initial relaxation phase. The tumbling time and the\nwidth of the trajectories in the centre-of-mass frame increase with time.

This work presents the first results that assess the\nfeasibility of using muons to interrogate waste silos within the UK Nuclear\nIndustry. Two such approaches, using different techniques that exploit each of\nthese properties, have previously been published, and show promising results\nfrom both simulation and experimental data for the detection of shielded high-Z\nmaterials and density variations from volcanic assay. Both detector systems are\nbased on scintillator and photomultiplier technologies.

Both results\nhighlight the potential to identify uranium objects of varying thicknesses\ngreater than 5cm within real-time durations of several weeks. Increased\ncontributions from Coulomb scattering within the concrete of the structure\nhinder the ability of both approaches to resolve objects of 2cm dimensions even\nwith increased statistics. These results are all dependent on both the position\nof the objects within the facility and the locations of the detectors.

The inclusion of this constant in the first law becomes\ninconsistent with the Smarr relation. Once the missing $P$-$V$ term introduced\nis, it becomes customary to introduce it only in problems where there is a\nnegative cosmological constant. This practice is inherited from cosmological\napproaches which consider the quantity $-\\Lambda/8\\pi$ as the constant pressure\ndue to a cosmological fluid. However, the notions of pressure and thermodynamic\nvolume in black hole thermodynamics are very different from their counterparts\nin classical thermodynamics. From this point of view, there is \\textit{a\npriori} no compelling reason to not extend this notion of pressure and\nassociate a partial pressure with each external\" density $8\\pi T_{t}{}^{t}$.

M\\\"oller operators, preserving respectively the Hilbert\nscalar product, for the Coulomb-gauge formulation of the models, and an\nindefinite metric, for the formulation of the models in the\nFeynman-Gupta-Bleuler gauge, are obtained in the presence of an infrared\ncutoff, with the help of suitable renormalization counterterms.

We explore single\ndegenerate Type Ia supernovae in the framework of two-dimensional SNIa\ndelayed-detonation explosion models. Travaglio et al.

Determining stellar characteristics such as the radius, the mass or\nthe age is crucial when studying stellar evolution, exoplanetary systems or\ncharacterising stellar populations in the Galaxy. Asteroseismology is the\ngolden path to accurately obtain these characteristics. In this context, a key\nquestion is how to make these methods less model-dependant. Aims. Building on\nthe work of Reese et al. (2012), we wish to extend the SOLA inversion technique\nto new stellar global characteristics in addition to the mean density. The goal\nis to provide a general framework in which to estimate these characteristics as\naccurately as possible in low mass main sequence stars. Methods. First, we\ndescribe our framework and discuss the reliability of the inversion technique\nand the possible sources of error.We then apply this methodology to the\nacoustic radius, an age indicator based on the sound speed derivative and the\nmean density and compare it to estimates based on the average large and small\nfrequency separations. These inversions are carried out for several test cases\nwhich include: various metallicities, different mixing-lengths, non-adiabatic\neffects and turbulent pressure. Results. We observe that the SOLA method yields\naccurate results in all test cases whereas results based on the large and small\nfrequency separations are less accurate and more sensitive to surface effects\nand structural differences in the models. If we include the surface corrections\nof Kjeldsen et al. (2008), we obtain results of comparable accuracy for the\nmean density. Overall, the mean density and acoustic radius inversions are more\nrobust than the inversions for the age indicator. Moreover, the current\napproach is limited to relatively young stars with radiative cores. Increasing\nthe number of observed frequencies improves the reliability and accuracy of the\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 13:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-28"}

A source multicasts two messages, a\ncommon and a private message, to several receivers. A subset of the receivers\n(called the public receivers) only demand the common message and the rest of\nthe receivers (called the private receivers) demand both the common and the\nprivate message. Three encoding schemes are discussed that employ linear\nsuperposition coding and their optimality is proved in special cases. The\nstandard linear superposition scheme is shown to be optimal for networks with\ntwo public receivers and any number of private receivers. When the number of\npublic receivers increases, this scheme stops being optimal. Two improvements\nare discussed: one using pre-encoding at the source, and one using a block\nMarkov encoding scheme. The rate-regions that are achieved by the two schemes\nare characterized in terms of feasibility problems. Both inner-bounds are shown\nto be the capacity region for networks with three (or fewer) public and any\nnumber of private receivers. Although the inner bounds are not comparable in\ngeneral, it is shown through an example that the region achieved by the block\nMarkov encoding scheme may strictly include the region achieved by the\npre-encoding/linear superposition scheme. Optimality results are founded on the\ngeneral framework of Balister and Bollob\\'as (2012) for sub-modularity of the\nentropy function. An equivalent graphical representation is introduced and a\nlemma is proved that might be of independent interest.\n  Motivated by the connections between combination networks and broadcast\nchannels, a new block Markov encoding scheme is proposed for broadcast channels\nwith two nested messages. The rate-region that is obtained includes the\npreviously known rate-regions.

While the nodal quasiparticles have\na Fermi liquid behaviour, the antinodal ones show non-Fermi liquid features and\nan associated pseudogap. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and\nelectronic Raman scattering are two valuable tools which have shown universal\nfeatures which are rather material-independent, and presumably intrinsic to the\npseudogap phase. The doping and temperature dependence of the Fermi arcs and\nthe pseudogap observed by photoemission near the antinode correlates with the\nnon-Fermi liquid behaviour observed by Raman for the B$_{1g}$ mode. In\ncontrast, and similar to the nodal quasiparticles detected by photoemission,\nthe Raman B$_{2g}$ mode shows Fermi liquid features. We show that these two\nexperiments can be analysed, in the context of the $t$-$J$ model, by\nself-energy effects in the proximity to a d-wave flux-phase order instability.\nThis approach supports a crossover origin for the pseudogap, and a scenario of\ntwo competing phases. The B$_{2g}$ mode shows, in an underdoped case, a\ndepletion at intermediate energy which has attracted a renewed interest.

Rather than\npostulating them and investigating the consequence of each definition, as is\ncustomary, here we adopt a bottom-up approach and construct the entropy\nexpression within the microcanonical formalism upon two fundamental\nthermodynamic pillars: (i) The second law of thermodynamics as formulated for\nquasi-static processes: $\\delta Q/T$ is an exact differential, and (ii) the law\nof ideal gases: $PV=k_B NT$. The first pillar implies that entropy must be some\nfunction of the phase volume $\\Omega$. The second pillar singles out the\nlogarithmic function among all possible functions. Hence the construction leads\nuniquely to the expression $S= k_B \\ln \\Omega$, that is the volume entropy. As\na consequence any entropy expression other than that of Gibbs, e.g., the\nBoltzmann entropy, can lead to inconsistencies with the two thermodynamic\npillars. We illustrate this with the prototypical example of a macroscopic\ncollection of non-interacting spins in a magnetic field, and show that the\nBoltzmann entropy severely fails to predict the magnetization, even in the\nthermodynamic limit. The uniqueness of the Gibbs entropy, as well as the\ndemonstrated potential harm of the Boltzmann entropy, provide compelling\nreasons for discarding the latter at once.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 13:45:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jan 2015 11:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Feb 2015 13:40:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 25 May 2015 14:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-28"}

Modulation is\ndetected in 15 stars. Most of them have non-typical period ratio of the radial\nmodes. In the Petersen diagram, at a given period of the fundamental mode, they\nare located significantly below or above the sequence formed by the majority of\nRRd stars.\n  Multi-periodic modulation is very frequent; two or three modulation periods\nare detected in 8 stars. Modulation periods vary from ~20 to more than 300\ndays. Radial mode amplitudes can be modulated by a few to nearly hundred per\ncent. Both radial modes may be modulated with the same period. More commonly\nhowever, dominant modulation for the fundamental mode has different period than\ndominant modulation for the first overtone. Quite often modulation of only one\nmode is detected in the data. We find a clear feedback between pulsation\namplitude of the dominant mode and mean stellar brightness: lower the pulsation\namplitude, brighter the star. At phases of low pulsation amplitude, the mode\nperiods are prone to fast changes. All the stars share the common feature:\ntheir pulsation properties are non-stationary. Amplitudes and phases of the\nradial modes vary irregularly on a long time-scale of a few hundred or thousand\ndays. The short-term modulations are also irregular.\n  One of the stars has switched the pulsation mode recently: from single-mode\nfundamental mode pulsation to RRd state. In other star the non-radial mode with\ncharacteristic ~0.61 period ratio to the first overtone is detected. This\nnon-radial mode is likely modulated with the same period as the radial modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 14:56:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 18:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-02"}

We find luminous HCN and HCO+ 3-2 emission in the main disk and\nwe detect compact (r<90 pc) vibrationally excited HCN 3-2, v2=1f emission\ncentred on the nucleus. The velocity field of the vibrationally excited HCN is\nstrongly inclined (PA=155 deg.) compared to the east-west rotation of the main\ndisk. The nuclear molecular mass is estimated to 8e8 Msun with an average\nN(H2)of 1.2e24 cm-2. Prominent, spatially extended (>350 pc) line wings are\nfound for HCN 3-2 with velocities +-750 km/s. Line ratios indicate that the\nemission is emerging in dense gas n=1e4 - 5e5 cm-3 of elevated HCN abundance\nX(HCN)=1e-8 to 1e-6. High X(HCN) also allows for the emission to originate in\ngas of more moderate density. We tentatively detect nuclear emission from the\nreactive ion HOC+ with HCO+/HOC+=10-20. The HCN v2=1f line emission is\nconsistent with the notion of a hot, dusty, warped inner disk of Mrk231 where\nthe v2=1f line is excited by bright mid-IR 14 micron continuum. We estimate the\nvibrational temperature T_vib to 200-400 K. We propose that 50% of the main HCN\nemission may have its excitation affected by the radiation field through IR\npumping of the vibrational ground state. The HCN emission in the line wings,\nhowever, is more extended and thus likely not strongly affected by IR pumping.\nOur results reveal that dense clouds survive (and/or are formed) in the AGN\noutflow on scales of at least several hundred pc before evaporating or\ncollapsing. The elevated HCN abundance in the outflow is consistent with warm\nchemistry possibly related to shocks and/or X-ray irradiated gas. An upper\nlimit to the mass and momentum flux is 4e8 Msun and 12L_AGN/c, respectively,\nand we discuss possible driving mechanisms for the dense outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Nov 2014 15:54:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}
