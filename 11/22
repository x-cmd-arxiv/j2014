Finding solar siblings will enable us to constrain the\nparameters of the parental cluster and the birth place of the Sun in the\nGalaxy. The solar siblings can be identified by accurate measurements of\nmetallicity, stellar age and elemental abundances for solar neighbourhood\nstars. The solar siblings candidates were kinematically selected based on their\nproper motions, parallaxes and colours. Stellar parameters were determined\nthrough a purely spectroscopic approach and partly physical method,\nrespectively. Comparing synthetic with observed spectra, elemental abundances\nwere computed based on the stellar parameters obtained using a partly physical\nmethod. A chemical tagging technique was used to identify the solar siblings.\nWe present stellar parameters, stellar ages, and detailed elemental abundances\nfor Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Ni for 32 solar sibling candidates.

The toroidal oscillation of the star propagates into the\nmagnetosphere, which provides additional voltage due to unipolar induction,\nchanges Goldreich-Julian charge density from the traditional value due to\nrotation, and hence, influences particle acceleration. We present a general\nsolution of the effect of oscillations within the framework of the inner vacuum\ngap model, and consider three different inner gap modes controlled by curvature\nradiation, inverse Compton scattering, and two photon annihilation,\nrespectively. With different pulsar parameters and oscillation amplitudes, one\nof three modes would play a dominant role in defining the gap properties. When\nthe amplitude of oscillation exceeds a critical value, mode changing would\noccur. Oscillations also lead to change of the size of the polar cap.

While most researchers\nare personally aware of the competition implicit in the publication process,\nlittle is known about the levels of inequality at the level of individual\nresearchers. We analyzed both productivity and impact measures for a large set\nof researchers publishing in high-impact journals.

Second, after controlling\nfor the time dependent features of citation distributions, we compare the\ncitation impact of subsequent publications within a researcher's publication\nrecord. We find that as researchers continue to publish in top journals, there\nis more likely to be a decreasing trend in the relative citation impact with\neach subsequent publication.

A typical hTf is folded into two homologous\nlobes; each lobe is further divided into two similar sized domains. Three\ndifferent crystal structures of hTf delineate large conformational changes\ninvolved in iron binding/dissociation. However, whether the release process\nfollows the same trend at serum (~7.4) and endosomal (~5.6) pH remains\nunanswered. The specialized role of the two lobes and if communication between\nthem leads to efficient and controlled release is also debated. Here, we study\nthe dynamics of the full structure as well as the separate lobes in different\nclosed, partially open, and open conformations under the nearly neutral pH\nconditions in the blood serum and the more acidic one in the endosome. The\nresults corroborate experimental observations and underscore the distinguishing\neffect of pH on the dynamics of hTf. Furthermore, in a total of 2 {\\mu}s\nmolecular dynamics simulation of different forms of hTf, residue fluctuations\nelucidate the cross talk between the two lobes correlated by the peptide linker\nbridging the two lobes at serum pH, while their correlated motions is lost\nunder endosomal conditions. At serum pH, the presence of even a single iron on\neither lobe leads C-lobe fluctuations to subside, making it the target for\nrecognition by human cells or hostile bacteria seeking iron sequestration. The\nN-lobe, on the other hand, has a propensity to open, making iron readily\navailable when needed at regions of serum pH. At endosomal pH, both lobes\nreadily open, making irons available for delivery. The interplay between the\nrelative mobility of the lobes renders efficient mechanism for the recognition\nand release of hTf at the cell surface, and therefore its recycling in the\norganism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 17:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-24"}

Although one-zone\nsynchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) models have been generally successful in\ninterpreting the high-energy emission observed in other BL Lac objects, they\nare problematic for UHBLs, necessitating very large Doppler factors and/or\nextremely high minimum Lorentz factors of the emitting leptonic population. In\nthis context, we have investigated alternative scenarios where hadronic\nemission processes are important, using a newly developed (lepto-)hadronic\nnumerical code to systematically explore the physical parameters of the\nemission region that reproduces the observed spectra while avoiding the extreme\nvalues encountered in pure SSC models. Assuming a fixed Doppler factor\n$\\delta=30$, two principal parameter regimes are identified, where the\nhigh-energy emission is due to: 1) proton-synchrotron radiation, with magnetic\nfields $B \\sim 1-100\\ \\textrm{G}$ and maximum proton energies $E_{p;max}\n\\lesssim 10^{19}$ eV; and 2) synchrotron emission from p-$\\gamma$-induced\ncascades as well as SSC emission from primary leptons, with $B \\sim 0.1-1\\\n\\textrm{G}$ and $E_{p;max} \\lesssim 10^{17}$ eV.

A variety of methods have been proposed in the literature to\naddress this inference problem. As far as we know, none of the objective\nfunctions in existing methods is convex. In machine learning and applied\nstatistics, a convex function such as the objective function of support vector\nmachines (SVMs) is generally preferred, since it can leverage the\nhigh-performance algorithms and rigorous guarantees established in the\nextensive literature on convex optimization. One may thus wonder if there\nexists a meaningful convex objective function for the inference problem in\nhuman computation. In this paper, we investigate this convexity issue for human\ncomputation. We take an axiomatic approach by formulating a set of axioms that\nimpose two mild and natural assumptions on the objective function for the\ninference. Under these axioms, we show that it is unfortunately impossible to\nensure convexity of the inference problem.

These degeneracies cannot be broken by the CMB constraint on the\neffective number of neutrinos, N_eff. However, since big bang nucleosynthesis\n(BBN) is also affected by a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos, complementary\nBBN and CMB constraints can break some of the degeneracy. In a previous paper\nBBN and CMB were combined to explore allowed ranges for m_chi, Delta N_nu, and\nN_eff for light WIMPs that annihilate electromagnetically (EM) to photons\nand/or electrons/positrons. In this paper BBN predictions with a light WIMP\nthat only couples to neutrinos are calculated. Recent observed abundances of\n^2H and ^4He are used to limit m_chi, Delta N_nu, N_eff, and the present-day\nbaryon density. Allowing for a neutrino coupled light WIMP and nonzero Delta\nN_nu, combined BBN and CMB data give lower limits to m_chi, with a best fit\nm_chi > 35 MeV, equivalent to no light WIMP at all.

In this work, the second of a\nseries, we assess the efficiency of electron heating by ion velocity-space\ninstabilities in collisionless accretion flows. The instabilities are seeded by\nthe pressure anisotropy induced by magnetic field amplification, coupled to the\nadiabatic invariance of the particle magnetic moments.

The auxiliary\nHiggs sector can be either perturbative or strongly coupled, similar to\ntechnicolor models. Since electroweak symmetry breaking is driven by a tadpole,\nthe cubic and quartic Higgs couplings can naturally be significantly smaller\nthan their values in the standard model. The theoretical motivation for these\nmodels is that they can explain the 125 GeV Higgs mass in supersymmetry without\nfine-tuning. The auxiliary Higgs sector contains additional Higgs states that\ncannot decouple from standard model particles, so these models predict a rich\nphenomenology of Higgs physics beyond the standard model. In this paper we\nanalyze a large number of direct and indirect constraints on these models. We\npresent the current constraints after the 8 TeV run of the LHC, and give\nprojections for the sensitivity of the upcoming 14 TeV run.

Out of the 65 groups and clusters in our\nsample for which we have abundance profiles, 8 of them have certain central\nabundance drops, with possible central abundance drops in another 6. All\nsources with central abundance drops have X-ray cavities, and all bar one\nexception have a central cooling time <=1 Gyr. These central abundance drops\ncan be generated if the iron injected by stellar mass loss processes in the\ncore of these sources is in grains, which then become incorporated in the\ncentral dusty filaments. These, in turn, are dragged outwards by the bubbling\nfeedback process in these sources. We find that data quality significantly\naffects the detection of central abundance drops, inasmuch as a higher number\nof counts in the central 20 kpc of a source makes it easier to detect a central\nabundance drop, as long as these counts are more than ~13000. On the other\nhand, the magnitude of the central abundance drop does not depend on the number\nof these counts, though the statistical significance of the measured drop does.\nFinally, in line with the scenario briefly outlined above, we find that, for\nmost sources, the location of X-ray cavities acts as an upper limit to the\nlocation of the peak in the radial metallicity distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 22:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

To capture features in these signals, it is\nnecessary for the analysis methods to be local, adaptive and stable. In recent\nyears, decomposition based analysis methods, such as the empirical mode\ndecomposition (EMD) technique pioneered by Huang et al., were developed by\ndifferent research groups. These methods decompose a signal into a finite\nnumber of components on which the time-frequency analysis can be applied more\neffectively.\n  In this paper we consider the iterative filters (IFs) approach as an\nalternative to EMD. We provide sufficient conditions on the filters that ensure\nthe convergence of IFs applied to any $L^2$ signal. Then we propose a new\ntechnique, the Adaptive Local Iterative Filtering (ALIF) method, which uses the\nIFs strategy together with an adaptive and data driven filter length selection\nto achieve the decomposition. Furthermore we design smooth filters with compact\nsupport from solutions of Fokker-Planck equations (FP filters) that can be used\nwithin both IFs and ALIF methods. These filters fulfill the derived sufficient\nconditions for the convergence of the IFs algorithm. Numerical examples are\ngiven to demonstrate the performance and stability of IFs and ALIF techniques\nwith FP filters. In addition, in order to have a complete and truly local\nanalysis toolbox for non-linear and non-stationary signals, we propose a new\ndefinition for the instantaneous frequency which depends exclusively on local\nproperties of a signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 23:35:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 10:42:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 11:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-26"}

We use a nematic with negative dielectric anisotropy with\nthe electric field applied perpendicularly to $\\hat{\\textbf{N}}$. The field\nchanges the dielectric tensor at optical frequencies (optic tensor) due to the\nfollowing mechanisms: (a) nanosecond creation of the biaxial orientational\norder; (b) uniaxial modification of the orientational order that occurs over\ntimescales of tens of nanoseconds, and (c) the quenching of director\nfluctuations with a wide range of characteristic times up to milliseconds. We\ndevelop a model to describe the dynamics of all three mechanisms. We design the\nexperimental conditions to selectively suppress the contributions from\nfluctuations quenching (c) and from the biaxial order effect (a) and thus,\nseparate the contributions of the three mechanisms in the electro-optic\nresponse. As a result, the experimental data can be well fitted with the model.\nThe analysis provides a detailed physical picture of how the liquid crystal\nresponds to a strong electric field on a timescale of nanoseconds.

This problem\nis motivated by modern applications such as recommender systems and social\nnetworks where only \"likes\" or \"friendships\" are observed. The problem of\nlearning from only positive and unlabeled examples, called PU\n(positive-unlabeled) learning, has been studied in the context of binary\nclassification. We consider the PU matrix completion problem, where an\nunderlying real-valued matrix M is first quantized to generate one-bit\nobservations and then a subset of positive entries is revealed. Under the\nassumption that M has bounded nuclear norm, we provide recovery guarantees for\ntwo different observation models: 1) M parameterizes a distribution that\ngenerates a binary matrix, 2) M is thresholded to obtain a binary matrix. For\nthe first case, we propose a \"shifted matrix completion\" method that recovers M\nusing only a subset of indices corresponding to ones, while for the second\ncase, we propose a \"biased matrix completion\" method that recovers the\n(thresholded) binary matrix. Both methods yield strong error bounds --- if M is\nn by n, the Frobenius error is bounded as O(1/((1-rho)n), where 1-rho denotes\nthe fraction of ones observed. This implies a sample complexity of O(n\\log n)\nones to achieve a small error, when M is dense and n is large. We extend our\nmethods and guarantees to the inductive matrix completion problem, where rows\nand columns of M have associated features. We provide efficient and scalable\noptimization procedures for both the methods and demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed methods for link prediction (on real-world networks consisting\nof over 2 million nodes and 90 million links) and semi-supervised clustering\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2014 04:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

It combines the advantages of variational calculations\nand perturbation theory. The vibrational problem is solved by diagonalizing a\nHamiltonian matrix, which is partitioned into two sub-blocks. The first,\nsmaller sub-block includes matrix elements with the largest contribution to the\nenergy levels targeted in the calculations. The second, larger sub-block\ncomprises those basis states which have little effect on these energy levels.\nNumerical perturbation theory, implemented as a Jacobi rotation, is used to\ncompute the contributions from the matrix elements of the second sub-block.\nOnly the first sub-block needs to be stored in memory and diagonalized.\nCalculations of the vibrational-rotational energy levels also employ a\npartitioning of the Hamiltonian matrix into sub-blocks, each of which\ncorresponds either to a single vibrational state or a set of resonating\nvibrational states, with all associated rotational levels. Physically, this\npartitioning is efficient when the Coriolis coupling between different\nvibrational states is small. Numerical perturbation theory is used to include\nthe cross-contributions from different vibrational states. Separate individual\nsub-blocks are then diagonalized, replacing the diagonalization of a large\nHamiltonian matrix with a number of small matrix diagonalizations. Numerical\nexamples show that the proposed hybrid variational-perturbation method greatly\nspeeds up the variational procedure without significant loss of precision for\nboth vibrational-rotational energy levels and transition intensities. The\nhybrid scheme can be used for accurate nuclear motion calculations on molecules\nwith up to 15 atoms on currently available computers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Nov 2014 08:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-13"}

However, DUGKS is proposed\nfor near incompressible fluid flows, the existing compressible effect may cause\nsome serious errors in simulating incompressible problems. To diminish the\ncompressible effect, in this paper a novel DUGKS model with external force is\ndeveloped for incompressible fluid flows by modifying the approximation of\nMaxwellian distribution. Meanwhile, due to the pressure boundary scheme, which\nis wildly used in many applications, has not been constructed for DUGKS, the\nnon-equilibrium extrapolation (NEQ) scheme for both velocity and pressure\nboundary conditions is introduced.

To this end, we use the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code ECOSMOG to study three variants ($|f_{R}|= 10^{-4}[$F4$],\n10^{-5}[$F5$]$ and $10^{-6}[$F6$]$) of the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model,\neach of which refers to a different magnitude for the scalar field that\ngenerates the fifth force.

The general strategy of controlling inverters to emulate the\nbehavior of nonlinear oscillators presents a compelling time-domain alternative\nto ubiquitous droop control methods which presume the existence of a\nquasi-stationary sinusoidal steady state and operate on phasor quantities. We\npresent two main results in this work. First, by leveraging the method of\nperiodic averaging, we demonstrate that droop laws are intrinsically embedded\nwithin a slower time scale in the nonlinear dynamics of Van der Pol\noscillators. Second, we establish the global convergence of amplitude and phase\ndynamics in a resistive network interconnecting inverters controlled as Van der\nPol oscillators. Furthermore, under a set of non-restrictive decoupling\napproximations, we derive sufficient conditions for local exponential stability\nof desirable equilibria of the linearized amplitude and phase dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 19:35:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 20:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-21"}

We compare the measures extracted from call\ndetail records and airtime credit purchases to the results of a nationwide\nhousehold survey conducted at the same time. Results show high correlations (>\n.8) between mobile phone data derived indicators and several relevant food\nsecurity variables such as expenditure on food or vegetable consumption.

The resonant-like structures are characterized by the values of the\nbasic ratio: the average lifetime of the individual states associated with a\ngiven structural form divided by the average interval between adjacent states.\nValues of the ratio are determined for three structural forms characterized by\nthe average intervals: 50 to 100 seconds (the fine structure), approximately10\nminutes, and approximately1 hour (the intermediate structures I and II). During\nthe trading day the values of the basic ratio associated with the fine\nstructure of the index are found to lie in the narrow range from 0.49 to 0.52.\nThis finding is characteristic of the highly statistical nature of many-body\nsystems typified by daily trading. It is therefore proposed that the value of\nthis ratio, determined in the first hour-or-so on a given day, be used to\nprovide information concerning the likely performance of the fine, statistical\ncomponent of the index for the remainder of the trading day. For the\nintermediate structures the basic ratios are approximately 0.6 and therefore\nthey too can be analyzed as individual states.\n  Keywords: Analytical economics; Lorentzian analyses of statistical structures\nin the Dow Jones Industrial Average; basic parameters of economic indices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 23:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-12"}
