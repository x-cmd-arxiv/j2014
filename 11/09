The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, it provides a\nproof of concept of the extent to which residual data from cloud-based\nsynchronized applications can be used to broadly identify user behavior\npatterns from device data patterns.

To answer this question, we focus on higher-dimensional\nstimulus domains, with particular emphasis on neural representations of the\nphysical space explored by an animal.

Peer review poses two key challenges: 1) identifying the reviewers'\nintrinsic capabilities (i.e., adverse selection) and 2) incentivizing the\nreviewers to exert high effort (i.e., moral hazard). Some works in mechanism\ndesign address pure adverse selection using one-shot matching rules, and pure\nmoral hazard was addressed in repeated games with exogenously given and fixed\nmatching rules. However, in peer review systems exhibiting both adverse\nselection and moral hazard, one-shot or exogenous matching rules do not link\nagents' current behavior with future matches and future payoffs, and as we\nprove, will induce myopic behavior (i.e., exerting the lowest effort) resulting\nin the lowest review quality.\n  In this paper, we propose for the first time a solution that simultaneously\nsolves adverse selection and moral hazard. Our solution exploits the repeated\ninteractions of agents, utilizes ratings to summarize agents' past review\nquality, and designs matching rules that endogenously depend on agents'\nratings. Our proposed matching rules are easy to implement and require no\nknowledge about agents' private information (e.g., their benefit and cost\nfunctions). Yet, they are effective in guiding the system to an equilibrium\nwhere the agents are incentivized to exert high effort and receive ratings that\nprecisely reflect their review quality. Using several illustrative examples, we\nquantify the significant performance gains obtained by our proposed mechanism\nas compared to existing one-shot or exogenous matching rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Nov 2014 17:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

This is of special importance for many crowd-sensing\napplications, where the phone can be carried in arbitrary positions and\norientations relative to the user body. Current state-of-the-art focus mainly\non estimating the phone orientation, require the phone to be placed in a\nparticular position, require user intervention, and/or do not work accurately\nindoors; which limits their ubiquitous usability in different applications. In\nthis paper we present Humaine, a novel system to reliably and accurately\nestimate the user orientation relative to the Earth coordinate system.\n  Humaine requires no prior-configuration nor user intervention and works\naccurately indoors and outdoors for arbitrary cell phone positions and\norientations relative to the user body. The system applies statistical analysis\ntechniques to the inertial sensors widely available on today's cell phones to\nestimate both the phone and user orientation.

The semi-analytical models show that DF (which is the only\nevolutionary mechanism at work) is responsible for the formation of a bimodal\ndistribution with a dip progressively moving toward the external regions of the\ncluster. However, these models fail to reproduce the formation of the\nlong-lived central peak observed in all dynamically evolved clusters. The\nresults of $N$-body simulations confirm the formation of a sharp central peak,\nwhich remains as a stable feature over the time regardless of the initial\nconcentration of the system.

Also the shape\nof the peak and the location of the minimum (which in most of the cases is\nwithin 10 core radii) turn out to be consistent with observational results.

Traditionally, because of large sample\nproperties for data over a large threshold value, generalised Pareto (GP)\ndistributions are often used for modelling extreme rainfall. It can be shown\nthat under certain conditions the generalised hyperbolic (GH) distributions can\napproximate the power law decay of the GP distribution in the tails. Given\ntheir flexible form, this raises the possibility that distributions from the GH\nfamily serve as a model for the entire rainfall distribution thus avoiding the\nneed to select a threshold. In this paper, we use a flexible censored\nhierarchical model that leverages the GH distribution to accommodate data\nsubject to heavy tails and an excessive number of zeros. The fitted model\nallows estimation of probabilities and return periods of the rainfall extremes,\nand it produces narrower credible intervals in the tails than the traditional\nGP method. The model not only fits the tails of the rainfall distribution, but\nfits the whole distribution very well. It also efficiently represents\nshort-term dependencies in the data so it is suitable for evaluating duration\nover and below thresholds as well as duration of zero rainfall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 2014 01:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

Very large optimal gain values are\nfound, making it possible for small-amplitude noise to be strongly amplified\nand to destabilize the flow. The optimal forcing is located close to the summit\nof the bump, while the optimal response is the largest in the shear layer. The\nlargest amplification occurs at frequencies corresponding to eigenvalues which\nfirst become unstable at higher Reynolds number. Nonlinear direct numerical\nsimulations show that a low level of noise is indeed sufficient to trigger\nrandom flow unsteadiness, characterized here by large-scale vortex shedding.\nNext, a variational technique is used to compute efficiently the sensitivity of\noptimal gains to steady control (through source of momentum in the flow, or\nblowing/suction at the wall). A systematic analysis at several frequencies\nidentifies the bump summit as the most sensitive region for control with wall\nactuation. Based on these results, a simple open-loop control strategy is\ndesigned, with steady wall suction at the bump summit. Linear calculations on\ncontrolled base flows confirm that optimal gains can be drastically reduced at\nall frequencies. Nonlinear direct numerical simulations also show that this\ncontrol allows the flow to withstand a higher level of stochastic noise without\nbecoming nonlinearly unstable, thereby postponing bypass transition. In the\nsupercritical regime, sensitivity analysis of eigenvalues supports the choice\nof this control design. Full restabilization of the flow is obtained, as\nevidenced by direct numerical simulations and linear stability analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 2014 04:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

These propagators are investigated both in momentum space and\ncoordinate space. The Monte Carlo simulation is performed at $\\beta=7.99,\n30.5,$ and $120$ on $62^2, 128^2,$ and $256^2$ at the quenched level. In the\nmomentum space, the transverse component of the diagonal gluon propagator shows\nsuppression with increasing $\\beta$ in the infrared region and the dressing\nfunction at $\\beta=120$ has a maximum at $p^2 \\simeq 4$GeV, while the\ntransverse component of the off-diagonal gluon propagator does not show the\n$\\beta$-dependence and the dressing function does not have a maximum. This\nbehavior indicates that the effect of the Gribov copies is found for the\ndiagonal gluon, consistent with the result obtained by the Gribov-Zwanziger\naction in the MAG. In addition, this behavior supports that the Abelian\ndominance is not found in two dimensions. In the coordinate space, the diagonal\ngluon propagator decreases as $\\beta$ increases at long distance. In\nparticular, at $\\beta=120$ the diagonal propagator decreases more rapidly with\nincreasing distance than the off-diagonal propagator. These behaviors also\nindicate the presence of Gribov copies and no Abelian dominance in two\ndimensions. Furthermore, we also study these propagators at\nzero-spatial-momentum. The result suggests that all of the spectral functions\nof diagonal and off-diagonal gluons would have negative regions and thus they\nshow the violation of the Kallen-Lehmann representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 2014 09:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

Further, the accurate evaluation of a potential design choice\nis computationally expensive because it requires detailed cycle-accurate system\nsimulation. If the discrete parameter space can be embedded into a larger\ncontinuous parameter space, then continuous space techniques can, in principle,\nbe applied to the system optimization problem. Such continuous space techniques\noften scale well with the number of parameters.\n  We propose a novel technique for embedding the discrete parameter space into\nan extended continuous space so that continuous space techniques can be applied\nto the embedded problem using cycle accurate simulation for evaluating the\nobjective function. This embedding is implemented using simulation-based\nergodic interpolation, which, unlike spatial interpolation, produces the\ninterpolated value within a single simulation run irrespective of the number of\nparameters. We have implemented this interpolation scheme in a cycle-based\nsystem simulator. In a characterization study, we observe that the interpolated\nperformance curves are continuous, piece-wise smooth, and have low statistical\nerror. We use the ergodic interpolation-based approach to solve a large\nmulti-core design optimization problem with 31 design parameters.

We\ndetermine the mass constraints of eruptive plasmas by assuming simplified\ngeometrical structures of the plasma with isothermal plasma temperatures. This\nmethod provides an upper limit to the masses of the observed eruptive plasmas\nin X-ray passbands since any clumping causes the overestimation of the mass.\nFor the other two events, we assume the temperatures are at the maximum\ntemperature of the XRT temperature response function, which gives a lower limit\nof the masses.

For four events, we find\nthat the thermal conduction time scales are much shorter than the duration of\neruption. This result implies that additional heating during the eruption may\nbe required to explain the plasma observations in X-rays for the four events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 2014 13:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Quantum optical systems, which offer long coherence\ntimes and easy manipulation of single qubits, allow us to probe quantum\nproperties of the light itself and of the physical systems around it. Recently,\na linear scheme for quantum computing, relying on the bosonic nature of\nparticles, has been proposed and realized experimentally with photons. The\nability to efficiently measure superpositions of quantum states consisting of\nseveral photons is essential to the characterization of such systems. In fact,\nthe entire field of quantum information completely relies on the ability to\nrecover quantum states from measurements. However, the characterization of\nquantum states requires many measurements, and often necessitates complicated\nmeasurements schemes; for example, characterizing qubits requires measurements.\nHere, we utilize structure, inherent to physically interesting quantum states\nof light, in order to reduce the complexity in the recovery of a quantum state.\nIn particular, we devise a method enabling the recovery of three-photon quantum\nstates from only two-fold correlation measurements in a single setting. The\nability to take two-fold coincidences instead of three-fold offers the recovery\nof the quantum states in far less measurements and in a considerably higher\nSNR, because detection of two-photon events is much more likely than that of\nthree-photon ones.

The local conservation of charge, momentum and energy are\nensured by the resolution of a system of scalar equations. Various simulation\ncomparisons have been carried out with and without the merging algorithm, from\nclassical plasma physics problems to extreme scenarios where quantum\nelectrodynamics is taken into account, showing in addition to the conservation\nof local quantities, the good reproducibility of the particle distributions. In\ncase where the number of particles ought to increase exponentially in the\nsimulation box, the dynamical merging permits a considerable speedup, and\nsignificant memory savings that otherwise would make the simulations impossible\nto perform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 2014 15:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-16"}

Phantom is\ncharacterized by the fact that it possesses negative momentum and kinetic\nenergy and that it gives large negative pressure which acts as antigravity. We\nconsider phantom harmonic oscillator in comparison to a standard harmonic\noscillator. By using the first law of thermodynamics we explain why the energy\ndensity of the Universe grows when it is filled with phantom. We also show how\nthe collision of phantom with a standard particle leads to exploration of\nenergy from the former by the latter (i.e. from phantom to the standard) if\ntheir masses are different. The most striking of our conclusions is that the\ncollision of phantom and standard particles of the same masses is impossible\nunless both of them are at rest and suddenly start moving with the opposite\nvelocities and kinetic energies. This effect is a classic analogue of a quantum\nmechanical particle pair creation in a strong electric field or in physical\nvacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Nov 2014 16:25:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Dec 2014 00:15:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-15"}

We\ncarefully develop this natural (Clifford) algebra of the Minkowski spacetime\ngeometry, with a particular focus on its intrinsic (and often overlooked)\ncomplex structure. Notably, the scalar imaginary that appears throughout the\nelectromagnetic theory properly corresponds to the unit 4-volume of spacetime\nitself, and thus has physical meaning. The electric and magnetic fields are\ncombined into a single complex and frame-independent bivector field, which\ngeneralizes the Riemann-Silberstein complex vector that has recently resurfaced\nin studies of the single photon wavefunction. The complex structure of\nspacetime also underpins the emergence of electromagnetic waves, circular\npolarizations, the normal variables for canonical quantization, the distinction\nbetween electric and magnetic charge, complex spinor representations of Lorentz\ntransformations, and the dual (electric-magnetic field exchange) symmetry that\nproduces helicity conservation in vacuum fields. This latter symmetry manifests\nas an arbitrary global phase of the complex field, motivating the use of a\ncomplex vector potential, along with an associated transverse and\ngauge-invariant bivector potential, as well as complex (bivector and scalar)\nHertz potentials. Our detailed treatment aims to encourage the use of spacetime\nalgebra as a readily available and mature extension to existing vector calculus\nand tensor methods that can greatly simplify the analysis of fundamentally\nrelativistic objects like the electromagnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Nov 2014 08:21:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Dec 2014 20:04:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2015 15:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-03"}
