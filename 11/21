The ESO archive of FORS1 spectropolarimetric observations may be\nused to create a homogeneous database of magnetic field measurements. However,\nno systematic comparison of FORS field measurements to those obtained with\nother instruments has been undertaken so far. AIMS. We exploit the FORS archive\nof circular spectropolarimetric data to examine in a general way how reliable\nand accurate field detections obtained with FORS are. METHODS. We examine the\nobservations of Ap and Bp stars, on the grounds that almost all of the\nunambiguous detections of magnetic fields in the FORS1 archive are in these\nkinds of stars. We assess the overall quality of the FORS1 magnetic data by\nexamining the consistency of field detections with what is known from previous\nmeasurements obtained with other instruments, and we look at patterns of\ninternal consistency. RESULTS. FORS1 magnetic measurements are fully consistent\nwith those made with other instruments, and the internal consistency of the\ndata is excellent. However, it is important to recognise that each choice of\ngrism and wavelength window constitutes a distinct instrumental measuring\nsystem, and that simultaneous field measurements in different instrumental\nsystems may produce field strength values that differ up to 20 %, or more.\nFurthermore, we found that field measurements using hydrogen lines only yield\nresults that meaningfully reflect the field strength as sampled specifically by\nlines of hydrogen for stars with effective temperatures above about 9000 K.\nCONCLUSIONS. In general the magnetic field measurements of Ap and Bp stars\nobtained with FORS1 are of excellent quality, accuracy and precision, and FORS1\nprovides an extremely useful example that offers valuable lessons for field\nmeasurements with other low- resolution Cassegrain spectropolarimeters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 16:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Magnetic reconnection can occur as a result of\neither electron conductivity and inertia, depending on which one predominates.\nWe eschew the use of an energy dependent collision frequency in the collisional\noperator model, unlike previous works. A model of the electron conductivity\nthat matches the weakly collisional regime to the exact Landau result at zero\ncollisionality and gives the correct electron isothermal response far from the\nreconnection region is presented. We identify in the breaking of the\nconstant-$A_{\\parallel}$ approximation the necessary condition for microtearing\ninstability in the collisional regime. Connections with the theory of\ncollisional non-isothermal (or semicollisional) and collisionless\ntearing-parity electron temperature gradient driven (ETG) modes are elucidated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 17:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Hosted in a tunnel\nof at least 50 km (CEPC) or 80-100 km (FCC), both projects can deliver very\nhigh luminosity from the Z peak to HZ threshold (CEPC) and even to the top pair\nthreshold and above (FCC-ee). At the ZH production optimum, around 240 GeV, the\nFCC-ee (CEPC) will be able to deliver 10 (5) ab-1 integrated luminosity in 5\n(10) years with 4 (2) interaction points: hence to produce millions of Higgs\nbosons through the Higgsstrahlung process and vector boson fusion processes.\nThis sample opens the possibility of subper- cent precision absolute\nmeasurements of the Higgs boson couplings to fermions and to gauge-bosons, and\nof the Higgs boson width. These precision measurements are potentially\nsensitive to multi-TeV range new physics interacting with the scalar sector.\nThe ZH production mechanism also gives access to the invisible or exotic\nbranching ratios down to the per mil level, and with a more limited precision\nto the triple Higgs coupling. For the FCC-ee, the luminosity expected at the\ntop pair production threshold (sqrt(s) ~ 340-350 GeV) further improves some of\nthese accuracies significantly, and is sensitive to the Higgs boson coupling to\nthe top quark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 17:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}

Although the\nmodel is admittedly phenomenological, our findings are very sound. For\nsingle--stranded DNA our solution yields the correct (monomer) scale and, yet\nmore importantly, the right persistence length of the molecule. In the\ndouble--stranded case, our model reproduces the well-known overstretching\ntransition and correctly captures the ratio between native DNA and\noverstretched DNA. Also in this case the model yields a persistence length in\ngood agreement with consensus, and it gives interesting insights into the\nbending stiffness of the native and overstretched molecule, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 17:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}

We first show that differential rotation\nis not at the origin of this large change in the tilt angle. A possible origin\nof this distortion is the nonlinear development of a kink-instability at the\nbase of the convective zone; this would imply the formation of a non-planar\nflux tube which, while emerging across the photosphere, would show a rotation\nof its photospheric polarities as observed. A characteristic of the flux tubes\ndeformed by this mechanism is that their magnetic twist and writhe should have\nthe same sign. From the observed evolution of the tilt of the bipoles, we\nderive the sign of the writhe of the flux tube forming each AR; while we\ncompute the sign of the twist from transverse field measurements. Comparing the\nhandedness of the magnetic twist and writhe, we find that the presence of\nkink-unstable flux tubes is coherent with no more than 35\\% of the 20 cases for\nwhich the sign of the twist can be unambiguously determined.

In this paper, we study quantum mechanical scattering in presence of\nextra compact space dimension in the hope of devising a method to get a clue to\nthe presence of extra space dimension. We consider a simplified model of\nscattering, in which a beam of free particles is scattered due to a one\ndimensional Dirac-delta potential in presence of an extra compact space\ndimension. We find that the incident, reflected and transmitted probability\ncurrent densities of the particles contain the information of the extra\ndimension. Thus, by measuring experimentally the reflected and transmitted\nprobability current densities of the particles, we may confirm the presence of\nextra dimension. We also show that the idea of compactification of the extra\ndimensions gives rise to the quantization of the energy values of the free\nparticles. So, by measuring the quantized energy values of the scattered free\nparticles, we may again confirm the presence of extra dimensions. We also\ndiscuss briefly, how the extra compact space dimensions can be detected if the\nscattering process is performed in (9+1) dimensions, in which six space\ndimensions are compact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 19:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

A graph $G$ is\ninterval colorable if it has an interval $t$-coloring for some positive integer\n$t$. For an interval colorable graph $G$, $W(G)$ denotes the greatest value of\n$t$ for which $G$ has an interval $t$-coloring. It is known that the complete\ngraph is interval colorable if and only if the number of its vertices is even.\nHowever, the exact value of $W(K_{2n})$ is known only for $n \\leq 4$.

Yet, whether a collisionless\nfaster-than-Coulomb energy transfer mechanism exists in two-temperature\naccretion flows is still an open question. We study the physics of electron\nheating during the growth of ion velocity-space instabilities, by means of\nmulti-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. A large-scale compression\n- embedded in a novel form of the PIC equations - continuously amplifies the\nfield. This constantly drives a pressure anisotropy P_perp > P_parallel, due to\nthe adiabatic invariance of the particle magnetic moments. We find that, for\nion plasma beta values beta_i ~ 5-30 appropriate for the midplane of\nlow-luminosity accretion flows, mirror modes dominate if the electron-to-proton\ntemperature ratio is > 0.2, whereas if it is < 0.2 the ion cyclotron\ninstability triggers the growth of strong Alfven-like waves, that pitch-angle\nscatter the ions to maintain marginal stability. We develop an analytical model\nof electron heating during the growth of the ion cyclotron instability, which\nwe validate with PIC simulations. We find that for cold electrons (beta_e <\nm_e/m_i), the electron energy gain is controlled by the magnitude of the\nE-cross-B velocity induced by the ion cyclotron waves. This term is independent\nof the initial electron temperature, so it provides a solid energy floor even\nfor electrons starting with extremely low temperatures. On the other hand, the\nelectron energy gain for beta_e > m_e/m_i - governed by the conservation of the\nmagnetic moment in the growing fields of the instability - is proportional to\nthe initial electron temperature. Our results have implications for\ntwo-temperature accretion flows as well as the solar wind and intracluster\nplasmas.

Models of\nrotating massive stars naturally develop very strong shear at composition\nboundaries, a necessary condition for MRI instability, and the MRI is subject\nto triply-diffusive destabilizing effects in radiative regions. We have used\nthe MESA stellar evolution code to compute magnetic effects due to the\nSpruit-Taylor mechanism and the MRI, separately and together, in a sample of\nmassive star models. We find that the MRI can be active in the later stages of\nmassive star evolution, leading to mixing effects that are not captured in\nmodels that neglect the MRI. The MRI and related magneto-rotational effects can\nmove models of given ZAMS mass across \"boundaries\" from degenerate CO cores to\ndegenerate O/Ne/Mg cores and from degenerate O/Ne/Mg cores to iron cores, thus\naffecting the final evolution and the physics of core collapse. The MRI acting\nalone can slow the rotation of the inner core in general agreement with the\nobserved \"initial\" rotation rates of pulsars.

Next, we present difference of convex algorithms for TL1 (DCATL1) in\ncomputing TL1-regularized constrained and unconstrained problems in CS. The\ninner loop concerns an $l_1$ minimization problem on which we employ the\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). For the unconstrained\nproblem, we prove convergence of DCATL1 to a stationary point satisfying the\nfirst order optimality condition. In numerical experiments, we identify the\noptimal value $a=1$, and compare DCATL1 with other CS algorithms on two classes\nof sensing matrices: Gaussian random matrices and over-sampled discrete cosine\ntransform matrices (DCT). We find that for both classes of sensing matrices,\nthe performance of DCATL1 algorithm (initiated with $l_1$ minimization) always\nranks near the top (if not the top), and is the most robust choice insensitive\nto the conditioning of the sensing matrix $A$. DCATL1 is also competitive in\ncomparison with DCA on other non-convex penalty functions commonly used in\nstatistics with two hyperparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 01:09:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 01:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 17:59:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2018 20:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-15"}

However, the dissociation mechanism on most\noxide surfaces is not well understood due to the experimental challenges of\npreparing surface structures and characterizing reaction pathways. To remedy\nthis problem, we propose the metal organic framework MOF-74 as an ideal model\nsystem to study water reactions. Its crystalline structure is well\ncharacterized; the metal oxide node mimics surfaces with exposed cations; and\nit degrades in water. Combining in situ IR spectroscopy and first-principles\ncalculations, we explored the MOF-74/water interaction as a function of vapor\npressure and temperature. Here, we show that, while adsorption is reversible\nbelow the water condensation pressure (~19.7 Torr) at room temperature, a\nreaction takes place at ~150 centigrades even at low water vapor pressures.\nThis important finding is unambiguously demonstrated by a clear spectroscopic\nsignature for the direct reaction using D2O, which is not present using H2O due\nto strong phonon coupling. Specifically, a sharp absorption band appears at 970\ncm-1 when D2O is introduced at above 150 centigrades, which we attribute to an\nO-D bending vibration on the phenolate linker. Although H2O undergoes a similar\ndissociation reaction, the corresponding O-H mode is too strongly coupled to\nMOF vibrations to detect. In contrast, the O-D mode falls in the phonon gap of\nthe MOF and remains localized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 01:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-10"}

In the National Hockey League (NHL), the market for scouting is set by\nthe NHLs Central Scouting Service which develops a ranking of draft eligible\nplayers. In addition to the Central Scouting rankings, NHL teams use their own\ninternal scouting to augment their knowledge of eligible players and develop\ntheir own rankings. Using a novel statistical approach we show in this paper\nthat the additional information possessed by teams provides better rankings\nthan those of Central Scouting. Using data from the 1998 to 2002 NHL drafts, we\nestimate that the average yearly gain per team from their internal scouting is\nbetween \\$1.8MM and \\$5.2MM. These values are consistent across the three\nmeasures of player productivity that we consider: cumulative Games Played,\ncumulative Time On Ice and cumulative Goals Versus Threshold where we have\naggregated these metrics across the first seven years post draft. We used this\ntime frame since teams generally retain rights to their draft picks for seven\nyears. Further, we find that no individual team outperformed the others in\nterms of draft performance. One byproduct of our analysis is the development of\na Draft Value Pick Chart to assess the worth of an individual selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 03:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-24"}

What's more, how\nto evaluate the performance limits in this new scenario is also needed to\nconsider. To this end, this paper investigates the performance limits of\nwireless communication in HSRs scenario. Since the hybrid information\ntransmitted between train and base station usually has diverse quality of\nservice (QoS) requirements, QoS-based achievable rate region is utilized to\ncharacterize the transmission performance in this paper. It is proved that\ntraditional ergodic capacity and outage capacity with unique QoS requirement\ncan be regarded as two extreme cases of the achievable rate region proposed in\nthis paper.

In contrast to weak correlations with galaxy\nstructure a strong link is found between the strength of the spiral arms and\ntidal forcing from nearby companion galaxies. This appears to support the\nlongstanding suggestion that either a tidal interaction or strong bar is a\nnecessary condition for driving grand-design spiral structure.

Most destructive collisions occur when the orbits of\nsmaller bodies are dynamically stirred up, either by the gravitational effect\nof locally formed Pluto-sized planetesimals (self-stirring scenario), or via\nsecular perturbation caused by an inner giant planet (planetary stirring). The\nrelative importance of these scenarios in debris systems is unknown. Here we\npresent new Herschel Space Observatory imagery of 11 discs selected from the\nmost massive and extended known debris systems. All discs were found to be\nextended at far-infrared wavelengths, five of them being resolved for the first\ntime. We evaluated the feasibility of the self-stirring scenario by comparing\nthe measured disc sizes with the predictions of the model calculated for the\nages of our targets. We concluded that the self-stirring explanation works for\nseven discs. However, in four cases, the predicted pace of outward propagation\nof the stirring front, assuming reasonable initial disc masses, was far too low\nto explain the radial extent of the cold dust. Therefore, for HD 9672, HD\n16743, HD 21997, and HD 95086, another explanation is needed. We performed a\nsimilar analysis for {\\ss} Pic and HR 8799, reaching the same conclusion. We\nargue that planetary stirring is a promising possibility to explain the disk\nproperties in these systems. In HR 8799 and HD 95086 we may already know the\npotential perturber, since their known outer giant planets could be responsible\nfor the stirring process. Our study demonstrates that among the largest and\nmost massive debris discs self-stirring may not be the only active scenario,\nand potentially planetary stirring is responsible for destructive collisions\nand debris dust production in a number of systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 11:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Even\nfor the initial stage of this process, only little effort has been devoted to\nthe understanding of the breaking process on the scale of the individual\nparticle size for thermalized mixed crystals. Here, we explore the\nshear-induced breaking for an equimolar two-dimensional binary model crystal\nwith a high interaction asymmetry between the two different species such that\nthe initial crystal has an intersecting square sublattice of the two\nconstituents. Using Brownian dynamics computer simulations, we show that the\ncombination of shear and thermal fluctuations leads to a characteristic\nhierarchical breaking scenario where initially, the more strongly coupled\nparticles are thermally distorted, paving the way for the weakly coupled\nparticles to escape from their cage. This in turn leads to mobile defects which\nmay finally merge, proliferating a cascade of defects, which triggers the final\nbreakage of the crystal. This scenario is in marked contrast to the breakage of\none-component crystals close to melting. Moreover, we explore the orientational\ndependence of the initial shear direction relative to the crystal orientation\nand compare this to the usual melting scenario without shear. Our results are\nverifiable in real-space experiments of superparamagnetic colloidal mixtures at\na pending air-water interface in an external magnetic field where the shear can\nbe induced by an external laser field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 11:37:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

By construction, all the\nrepresentations and their derivatives of any order are continuous on the full\ndomains of their independent variables. The same type of technique provides an\nanalytical representation of the function inverse to the FD integral of order\n$1/2$. It plays an important role in physical problems related to the electron\ngas at finite temperature. From direct evaluation, the quality of these\nimproved representations is shown to be substantially superior to existing\nones, many of which were developed before the era of large-scale computation or\nearly in the era.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 12:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-21"}

[5]. S{\\ae}ther and Telle\naddress this problem in their paper [13] by introducing a new parameter,\nsplit-matching-width, which lies between treewidth and clique-width in terms of\ngenerality. They show that even though graphs of restricted\nsplit-matching-width might be dense, solving problems such as Hamiltonian Cycle\ncan be done in FPT time.\n  Recently, it was shown that Hamiltonian Cycle parameterized by treewidth is\nin EPT [1, 6], meaning it can be solved in $n^{O(1)} 2^{O(k)}$-time. In this\npaper, using tools from [6], we show that also parameterized by\nsplit-matching-width Hamiltonian Cycle is EPT. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first EPT algorithm for any \"globally constrained\" graph problem\nparameterized by a non-trivial and non-sparse structural parameter. To\naccomplish this, we also give an algorithm constructing a branch decomposition\napproximating the minimum split-matching-width to within a constant factor.\nCombined, these results show that the algorithms in [13] for Edge Dominating\nSet, Chromatic Number and Max Cut all can be improved.

It is demonstrated that if a kink hits the defect from\nthe gain side, a noticeable IM is excited, while for the kink coming from the\nopposite direction the mode excitation is much weaker. This asymmetry is a\nprincipal finding of the present work. Similar to the case of the sine-Gordon\nkink studied earlier, it is found that the $\\phi^4$ kink approaching the defect\nfrom the gain side always passes through the defect, while in the opposite case\nit must have sufficiently large initial velocity, otherwise it is trapped by\nthe loss region. It is found that for the kink with IM the critical velocity is\nsmaller, meaning that the kink bearing IM can pass more easily through the loss\nregion. This feature, namely the \"increased transparency\" of the defect as\nregards the motion of the kink in the presence of IM is the second key finding\nof the present work. A two degree of freedom collective variable model offered\nrecently by one of the co-authors is shown to be capable of reproducing both\nprincipal findings of the present work. A simpler, analytically tractable\nsingle degree of freedom collective variable method is used to calculate\nanalytically the kink phase shift and the kink critical velocity sufficient to\npass through the defect.

A search of the literature on doped\na-C:H reveals a number of interesting phenomena of relevance to astrophysics.\nResults. X dopants in a-C:H:X materials can affect the sp3/sp2 ratio (X = Si, O\nand N), lead to blue photoluminescence (undoped or X = N), induce\nferromagnetic-like behaviour (X = N and S) or simply be incorporated (depleted)\ninto the structure (X = Si, O, N and S).

In the partially ionized\nsolar chromosphere, collisions between ions and neutrals are an efficient\ndissipative mechanism for Alfven waves with frequencies near the ion-neutral\ncollision frequency. The collision frequency is proportional to the ion-neutral\ncollision cross section for momentum transfer. Here, we investigate Alfven wave\ndamping as a function of height in a simplified chromospheric model and compare\nthe results for two sets of collision cross sections, namely those of the\nclassic hard-sphere model and those based on recent quantum-mechanical\ncomputations. We find important differences between the results for the two\nsets of cross sections. There is a critical interval of wavelengths for which\nimpulsively excited Alfven waves are overdamped as a result of the strong\nion-neutral dissipation. The critical wavelengths are in the range from 1 km to\n50 km for the hard-sphere cross sections, and from 1 m to 1 km for the\nquantum-mechanical cross sections. Equivalently, for periodically driven Alfven\nwaves there is an optimal frequency for which the damping is most effective.\nThe optimal frequency varies from 1 Hz to 10^2 Hz for the hard-sphere cross\nsections, and from 10^2 Hz to 10^4 Hz for the quantum-mechanical cross\nsections. Future observations at sufficiently high spatial or temporal\nresolution may show the importance of high-frequency Alfven waves for\nchromospheric heating.

The motivation for such an approach comes from the study of\nbiophysical sensory networks in the brain, wherein responsiveness to both\nenergy and salience (or novelty) are presumably critical for mediating behavior\nand function. Here, we use an inner product to define the angular separation of\nthe current input with respect to the past input history. Then, by constraining\ninput energy, we define a non-convex optimal control problem to obtain the\nminimally novel input that effects a given state transfer. We provide\nanalytical conditions for existence and uniqueness in continuous-time, as well\nas an explicit closed-form expression for the solution. In discrete time, we\nshow that a relaxed convex optimization formulation provides the global optimal\nsolution of the original non-convex problem. Finally, we show how the minimum\nnovelty control can be used as a metric to study control properties of large\nscale recurrent neuronal networks and other complex linear systems. In\nparticular, we highlight unique aspects of a system's controllability that are\ncaptured through the novelty-based metric. The result suggests that a\nmultifaceted approach, combining energy-based analysis with other specific\nmetrics, may be useful for obtaining more complete controllability\ncharacterizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 14:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-24"}

In such a halo, an initially\nisothermal collapse will occur, leading to high accretion rates of\n$\\sim0.1$~M$_\\odot$~yr$^{-1}$. During the collapse, the gas in the interior\nwill turn into a molecular state, and form an accretion disk due to the\nconservation of angular momentum. We consider here the structure of such an\naccretion disk and the role of viscous heating in the presence of high\naccretion rates for a central star of $10$, $100$ and $10^4$~M$_\\odot$. Our\nresults show that the temperature in the disk increases considerably due to\nviscous heating, leading to a transition from the molecular to the atomic\ncooling phase. We found that the atomic cooling regime may extend out to\nseveral $100$~AU for a $10^4$~M$_\\odot$ central star and provides substantial\nsupport to stabilize the disk. It therefore favors the formation of a massive\ncentral object. The comparison of clump migration and contraction time scales\nshows that stellar feedback from these clumps may occur during the later stages\nof the evolution. Overall, viscous heating provides an important pathway to\nobtain an atomic gas phase within the center of the halo, and helps in the\nformation of very massive objects.

In the framework of static clustering, we start by\nintroducing a soft kernel spectral clustering (SKSC) algorithm, which can\nbetter deal with overlapping clusters with respect to kernel spectral\nclustering (KSC) and provides more interpretable outcomes. Afterwards, a whole\nstrategy based upon KSC for community detection of static networks is proposed,\nwhere the extraction of a high quality training sub-graph, the choice of the\nkernel function, the model selection and the applicability to large-scale data\nare key aspects. This paves the way for the development of a novel clustering\nalgorithm for the analysis of evolving networks called kernel spectral\nclustering with memory effect (MKSC), where the temporal smoothness between\nclustering results in successive time steps is incorporated at the level of the\nprimal optimization problem, by properly modifying the KSC formulation. Later\non, an application of KSC to fault detection of an industrial machine is\npresented. Here, a smart pre-processing of the data by means of a proper\nwindowing operation is necessary to catch the ongoing degradation process\naffecting the machine. In this way, in a genuinely unsupervised manner, it is\npossible to raise an early warning when necessary, in an online fashion.\nFinally, we propose a new algorithm called incremental kernel spectral\nclustering (IKSC) for online learning of non-stationary data. This ambitious\nchallenge is faced by taking advantage of the out-of-sample property of kernel\nspectral clustering (KSC) to adapt the initial model, in order to tackle\nmerging, splitting or drifting of clusters across time.

We then introduce the dual\nprojectivized Clifford algebra $\\mathbf{P}(\\mathbb{R}^*_{n,0,1})$ (euclidean\nPGA) as the most promising homogeneous (1-up) candidate for euclidean geometry.\nWe compare euclidean PGA and the popular 2-up model CGA (conformal geometric\nalgebra), restricting attention to flat geometric primitives, and show that on\nthis domain they exhibit the same formal feature set. We thereby establish that\neuclidean PGA is the smallest structure-preserving euclidean GA. We compare the\ntwo algebras in more detail, with respect to a number of practical criteria,\nincluding implementation of kinematics and rigid body mechanics. We then extend\nthe comparison to include euclidean sphere primitives. We conclude that\neuclidean PGA provides a natural transition, both scientifically and\npedagogically, between vector space models and the more complex and powerful\nCGA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Nov 2014 15:52:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 11:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2015 05:22:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 09:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}
