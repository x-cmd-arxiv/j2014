Our aim is to compare the difficulty of\nthese two tasks executed under stringent running time constraints. The measure\nof difficulty is the amount of information that nodes of the network must\ninitially possess in order to solve the given task in an imposed amount of\ntime. Following the standard framework of $\\textit{algorithms with advice}$,\nthis information (a single binary string) is provided to all nodes at the start\nby an oracle knowing the entire graph.

The\nimportant quantity is the maximum WIMP speed in the observer's rest frame, i.e.\nin average the sum of the local Galactic escape speed $v_{\\rm esc}$ and of the\ncircular velocity of the Sun $v_c$. While the latter has been receiving\ncontinuous attention, the former is more difficult to constrain. The RAVE\nCollaboration has just released a new estimate of $v_{\\rm esc}$ (Piffl {\\em et\nal.}, 2014 --- P14) that supersedes the previous one (Smith {\\em et al.},\n2007), which is of interest in the perspective of reducing the astrophysical\nuncertainties in DD. Nevertheless, these new estimates cannot be used blindly\nas they rely on assumptions in the dark halo modeling which induce tight\ncorrelations between the escape speed and other local astrophysical parameters.\nWe make a self-consistent study of the implications of the RAVE results on DD\nassuming isotropic DM velocity distributions, both Maxwellian and ergodic.\nTaking as references the experimental sensitivities currently achieved by LUX,\nCRESST-II, and SuperCDMS, we show that: (i) the exclusion curves associated\nwith the best-fit points of P14 may be more constraining by up to $\\sim 40$%\nwith respect to standard limits, because the underlying astrophysical\ncorrelations induce a larger local DM density; (ii) the corresponding relative\nuncertainties inferred in the low WIMP mass region may be moderate, down to\n10-15% below 10 GeV. We finally discuss the level of consistency of these\nresults with other independent astrophysical constraints. This analysis is\ncomplementary to others based on rotation curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2014 17:10:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 10:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-23"}

The first, a phenomenological model based on\nphysically realizable rational functions, enables the extraction of multiple\nresonance frequencies and widths for coupled resonators without explicit\nspecification of the circuit network.

Due to the strong anisotropic atomic structure of BP, its electronic\nconductivity and optical response are sensitive to the magnitude and the\norientation of the applied strain. We found that the inclusion of many body\neffects is essential for the correct description of the electronic properties\nof monolayer BP; for example while the electronic gap of strainless BP is found\nto be 0.90 eV by using semilocal functionals, it becomes 2.31 eV when many-body\neffects are taken into account within the G0W0 scheme. Applied tensile strain\nwas shown to significantly enhances electron transport along zigzag direction\nof BP. Furthermore, biaxial strain is able to tune the optical band gap of\nmonolayer BP from 0.38 eV (at -8% strain) to 2.07 eV (at 5.5%). The exciton\nbinding energy is also sensitive to the magnitude of the applied strain. It is\nfound to be 0.40 eV for compressive biaxial strain of -8%, and it becomes 0.83\neV for tensile strain of 4%. Our calculations demonstrate that the optical\nresponse of BP can be significantly tuned using strain engineering which\nappears as a promising way to design novel photovoltaic devices that capture a\nbroad range of solar spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2014 18:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The problem is\nformulated mathematically using the immersed boundary framework in which Dirac\ndelta functions are employed to capture the two-way interaction between fluid\nand immersed structure. The elastic structure is driven parametrically via a\ntime-periodic modulation of the elastic membrane stiffness. We perform a\nFloquet stability analysis, considering the case of both a viscous and inviscid\nfluid, and demonstrate that the forced fluid-membrane system gives rise to\nparametric resonances in which the solution becomes unbounded even in the\npresence of viscosity.

There\nare four possible final states of chaotic particles: collision with the planet,\ncollision with the star, escape, or bounded but non-collision orbits. In our\ninvestigations, within the framework of the planar circular restricted three\nbody problem for planet-star mass ratio $\\mu$ in the range $10^{-9}$ to\n$10^{-1.5}$, we find no particles hitting the star. The relative frequencies of\nescape and collision with the planet are not scale-free, as they depend upon\nthe size of the planet. For planet radius $R_p\\ge0.001R_H$ where $R_H$ is the\nplanet's Hill radius, we find that most chaotic zone particles collide with the\nplanet for $\\mu\\lesssim10^{-5}$; particle scattering to large distances is\nsignificant only for higher mass planets. For fixed ratio $R_p/R_H$, the\nparticle clearing timescale, $T_{cl}$, has a broken power-law dependence on\n$\\mu$.

The first is that the measured\ndark-matter relic density can be satisfied with new physics at O(100 GeV - 1\nTeV), while the null results from direct-detection experiments place lower\nbounds of O(10 TeV) on a new-physics scale. The second puzzle is that the\nsevere suppression of lepton-flavor-violating processes involving electrons,\ne.g. mu->3e, tau->e mu mu, etc., implies that generic new-physics contributions\nto lepton interactions cannot exist below O(10 - 100 TeV), whereas the 3.6sigma\ndeviation of the muon g-2 from the standard model can be explained by a\nnew-physics scale < O(1 TeV). Here, we suggest that it may not be a coincidence\nthat both the muon g-2 and the relic density can be satisfied by a new-physics\nscale < 1 TeV. We consider the possibility of a gauged lepton-flavor\ninteraction that couples at tree level only to mu- and tau-flavored leptons and\nthe dark sector. Dark matter thus interacts appreciably only with particles of\nmu and tau flavor at tree level and has loop-suppressed couplings to quarks and\nelectrons. Remarkably, if such a gauged flavor interaction exists at a scale\nO(100 GeV - 1 TeV), it allows for a consistent phenomenological framework,\ncompatible with the muon g-2, the relic density, direct detection, indirect\ndetection, charged-lepton decays, neutrino trident production, and results from\nhadron and e+e- colliders.

In fact, observations\nsuggest that higher electron densities, higher ionization parameters, and\nharder UV radiation fields are common. In this paper, based on the spectra of\nH$\\alpha$-selected star-forming galaxies at $z=2.5$ taken with Multi-Object\nSpectrometer for InfraRed Exploration (MOSFIRE) on Keck-1 telescope, we measure\nelectron densities ($n_e$) using the oxygen line ratio (\n[OII]$\\lambda\\lambda$3726,3729), and investigate the relationships between the\nelectron density of ionized gas and other physical properties. As a result, we\nfind that the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and the surface density of\nSFR ($\\Sigma_\\mathrm{SFR}$) are correlated with the electron density at $z=2.5$\nfor the first time. The $\\Sigma_\\mathrm{SFR}-n_e$ relation is likely to be\nlinked to the star formation law in HII regions (where star formation activity\nis regulated by interstellar pressure). Moreover, we discuss the mode of star\nformation in those galaxies. The correlation between sSFR and\n$\\Sigma_\\mathrm{SFR}$ suggests that highly star-forming galaxies (with high\nsSFR) tend to be characterized by higher surface densities of star formation\n($\\Sigma_\\mathrm{SFR}$) and thus higher $n_e$ values as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2014 21:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 21:18:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 21:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

In this work, a novel evolutionary\nstochastic model is introduced that couples short-term formalism (during\nradiotherapy) and long-term formalism (post treatment). This framework is used\nto estimate the risks of second cancer as a function of spontaneous background\nand radiation-induced mutation rates of normal and pre-malignant cells. By\nfitting the model to available clinical data for spontaneous background risk\ntogether with data of Hodgkins lymphoma survivors (for various organs), the\nsecond cancer mutation rate is estimated.

Our main results\ninclude: (i) convergence of value iteration when starting from certain\nfunctions above the optimal cost function; (ii) convergence of transfinite\nvalue iteration starting from zero, in the special case where the optimal cost\nfunction is nonnegative; and (iii) partial convergence of value iteration\nstarting from zero, for a subset of initial states.\n  These results extend several previously known results about the convergence\nof value iteration for either positive costs problems or GC total cost\nproblems. In particular, the first result on convergence of value iteration\nfrom above extends a theorem of van der Wal for the GC model. The second result\nrelates to Maitra and Sudderth's analysis of transfinite value iteration for\nthe positive costs model. It suggests connections between the two total cost\nmodels when the optimal cost function is nonnegative, and it leads to\nadditional results on the convergence of ordinary non-transfinite value\niteration, with a suitably defined dynamic programming operator, for finite\nstate or finite control GC problems. The third result on partial convergence of\nvalue iteration is motivated by Whittle's bridging condition for the positive\ncosts model, and provides a novel extension of the bridging condition to the GC\nmodel, where there are no sign constraints on the costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 00:18:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2015 04:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-22"}

Whereas thermohaline mixing is too\ninefficient to interfere with the C-flame propagation, convective boundary\nmixing can prevent the C burning from reaching the center. As a result, a\nC-O-Ne white dwarf (WD) is formed, after the star has lost its envelope. Such a\n\"hybrid\" WD has a small CO core surrounded by a thick ONe zone.

It is found\nthat the $J/\\psi \\to p\\bar{p}\\eta'$ data are useful for disentangling the above\nor below threshold resonant contribution, though it still further needs the\ndifferential cross section data of $\\pi N \\to \\eta'N$ to realize some of the\nresonant and the non-resonant contribution. Our results are enlightening for\nthe $\\eta'N$ production mechanism and the properties of the nucleon resonances\nwith the mass around 2.0~GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 04:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-03"}

With\ndecreasing temperature, the lattice parameters $a$ and $\\gamma$ increased, $c$\ndecreased, while $b$ was nearly constant. For $x\\leq3.5$, sudden sharp changes\nin $a$ and $b$ parameters additionally occurred, resulting in $a=b$ in some\nregions of the phase diagram, which might be related to the refinement of twin\nstructure of 10M martensite on nanoscale. The temperature dependences of\nlattice parameter $\\gamma$ (and $c$ or $c/a$) correlate well with the\ntemperature dependences of twinning stress in agreement with the prediction by\na microstructural model of twin boundary motion. On the contrary, there is no\ncorrelation between $(a-b)$ and twinning stress. This indicates no significant\nrole of $a/b$ twins or laminate in twin boundary motion mechanism and low\ntwinning stress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 09:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-24"}

Among the\nproposed solutions, the Twisted Stacked Tape Cable (TSTC) is easy to\nmanufacture and has very high tape length usage efficiency. In this kind of\ncables the tapes are closely packed, so that their electromagnetic interaction\nis very strong and determines the overall performance of the cable. Numerical\nmodels are necessary tools to precisely evaluate this interaction and to\npredict the cable's behavior, e.g. in terms of effective critical current and\nmagnetization currents. For this purpose, we developed a fully\nthree-dimensional model of a TSTC, which not only takes into account the\ntwisted geometry of these cables, but is also able to account for the contact\nresistances of the current terminations. The latter can have profound influence\non the way the current is partitioned among the tapes, especially on short\nlaboratory prototypes. In this paper, we first use the numerical model to\ncompute the critical current and the magnetization AC loss of a twisted tape,\nshowing the differences with the case of a straight tape. Then, we use it to\ncalculate the current distribution in a TSTC cable, comparing the results with\nthose experimentally obtained on a cable composed of four straight stacked\ntapes. The results show the ability of the model to simulate twisted conductors\nand constitutes a first step toward the simulation of TSTC in high-field magnet\napplications. The presented modeling approach is not restricted to the TSTC\ngeometry, but may be used for any cable configuration with periodical\ntranslational symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 10:15:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 13:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-30"}

We derive four time slot alignment solutions\n(sequential alignment, random alignment, p-persistent ranking and DTX alignment\nwith memory) and identify trade-offs. One solution, DTX alignment with memory,\naddresses trade-offs of the other three by maintaining memory of past alignment\nand channel quality to buffer short term changes in channel quality. All\nstrategies are found to exhibit similar convergence behavior, but different\npower consumption and retransmission probabilities. DTX alignment with memory\nis shown to achieve up to 40% savings in power consumption and more than 20%\nlower retransmission probability than the state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 11:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-07"}

In such a generalized\nclassification a basic role is played by the geometric Fierz identities. In 4D\nMinkowski spacetime the standard bilinear covariants can be either null or\nnon-null -- with the exception of the current density which is invariably\ndifferent from zero for physical reasons -- and sweep all types of spinor\nfields, including Dirac, Weyl, Majorana and more generally flagpoles,\nflag-dipoles and dipole spinor fields. To obtain an analogous classification in\nhigher dimensions we use the Fierz identities, which constrain the covariant\nbilinears in the spinor fields and force some of them to vanish. A generalized\ngraded Fierz aggregate is moreover obtained in such a context simply from the\ncompleteness relation. We analyze the particular and important case of\nRiemannian 7-manifolds, where the Majorana spinor fields turn out to have a\nquite special place. In particular, at variance with spinor fields in 4D\nMinkowski spacetime that are classified in six disjoint classes, spinors in\nRiemannian 7-manifolds are shown to be classified, according to the bilinear\ncovariants: (a) in just one class, in the real case of Majorana spinors; (b) in\nfour classes, in the most general case. Much like new classes of spinor fields\nin 4D Minkowski spacetime have been evincing new possibilities in physics, we\nthink these new classes of spinor fields in seven dimensions are, in\nparticular, potential candidates for new solutions in the compactification of\nsupergravity on a seven-dimensional manifold and its exotic versions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 12:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-17"}

Analysis of the LITTLE THINGS HI data\ncube shows an expanding HI hole with 100 pc diameter and a dynamical age of\n$3.8\\pm 0.3 \\rm Myr$, centred to within 16 pc on IC 10 X-1, a massive stellar\nmass black hole ($M > 23 M_\\odot$). The results are consistent with the\nexpected evolution for a superbubble with a few massive stars, where a very\nenergetic event like a Type Ic supernova/hypernova has taken place about 1 Myr\nago. We discuss alternatives to this interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 13:31:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 11:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

This two-dimensional state\ninherits many properties of the nearby one-dimensional phase of decoupled\nanti-ferromagnetic spin chains, but also shows some remarkable differences. We\ndiscuss the spin structure factors and other physical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 14:11:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 20:36:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Jan 2015 14:34:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2015 14:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-05"}

In particular, standardized\ntests do not test knowledge that is obvious for people; none of this knowledge\ncan be assumed in AI systems. Individual standardized tests also have specific\nfeatures that are not necessarily appropriate for an AI benchmark.

I also argue that the apparent advantages offered by using\nstandardized tests are mostly either minor or illusory.

Whenever an amount of money is revealed to the players in some\nvariation, we will make our calculations based on the revealed amount,\nsomething that is not achieved in other papers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 11:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-12"}

In this model, a circle travelling at constant speed\nintersects the line in a pair of points which first separate and then rejoin.\nWe interpret this as the creation and annihilation of a pair of particles, and\ndescribe the trajectories as seen by inhabitants of the one dimensional\nuniverse. In our final scenario, considering Lineland as curved, we show how\nsufficiently accurate measurements will push inhabitants of Lineland to reject\ntheir theory for a purely geometric interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Nov 2014 10:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

By `mainstream' we\nmean the type of climate science that dominates in universities and research\ncentres, which we will term `academic' climate science, in contrast to `policy'\nclimate science; aspects of this distinction will become clearer in what\nfollows.\n  In a nutshell, we do not think that academic climate science equips climate\nscientists to be as helpful as they might be, when involved in climate policy\nassessment. Partly, we attribute this to an over-investment in high resolution\nclimate simulators, and partly to a culture that is uncomfortable with the\ninherently subjective nature of climate uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Nov 2014 20:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}
