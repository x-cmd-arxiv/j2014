Those types of\nmodels have been extensively fitted to in vitro data where the input current is\ncontrolled. Those models are however of little use when it comes to\ncharacterize intracellular in vivo recordings since the input to the neuron is\nnot known. Here we propose a novel single neuron model that characterizes the\nstatistical properties of in vivo recordings. More specifically, we propose a\nstochastic process where the subthreshold membrane potential follows a Gaussian\nprocess and the spike emission intensity depends nonlinearly on the membrane\npotential as well as the spiking history. We first show that the model has a\nrich dynamical repertoire since it can capture arbitrary subthreshold\nautocovariance functions, firing-rate adaptations as well as arbitrary shapes\nof the action potential. We then show that this model can be efficiently fitted\nto data without overfitting. Finally, we show that this model can be used to\ncharacterize and therefore precisely compare various intracellular in vivo\nrecordings from different animals and experimental conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 16:10:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 15:21:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 13:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

One of the most important pieces\nof information comes from the chemical composition of primary particles. It is\nwell known that the muon content of air showers generated by the interaction of\ncosmic rays with the atmosphere is rather sensitive to primary mass. Therefore,\nthe measurement of the number of muons at ground level is an essential\ningredient to infer the cosmic ray mass composition. In this work we present a\nnew method for reconstructing the muon lateral distribution function with an\narray of segmented counters. The energy range from .4 to 2.5 EeV is considered.\nFor a triangular array spaced at 750 m we found that 450 m is the optimal\ndistance to evaluate the number of muons.

Since the statistical uncertainty of the new reconstruction is\nless than in the original one, the power to discriminate between heavy and\nlight cosmic ray primaries is enhanced. The detector dynamic range is also\nextended in the new reconstruction, so events falling closer to a detector can\nbe included in composition studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 17:15:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-16"}

It is critical and\nfundamental to study the thermal and electrical transport properties in a\nsingle silver nanowire. In this work, the thermal and electrical transport in\nan individual silver nanowire is characterized down to 35 K with the steady\nstate electro-thermal technique. The results indicate that, at room\ntemperature, the electrical resistivity increases by around 4 folds compared\nfrom that of its bulk counterpart. After fitting the temperature dependent\nelectrical resistivity curves with the Bloch-Gr\\\"uneisen formula, the Debye\ntemperature (151 K) of the silver nanowire is found 36% lower than that (235 K)\nof bulk silver, confirming strong phonon softening. The thermal conductivity is\nreduced by 55% compared with that of its bulk counterpart at room temperature\nand this reduction becomes larger as the temperature goes down. To explain the\nopposite trends of thermal conductivity (\\k{appa}) ~ temperature (T) of silver\nnanowire and bulk silver, a unified thermal resistivity is used to elucidate\nthe electron scattering mechanism. A large residual unified thermal resistivity\nfor the silver nanowire is observed while that of the bulk silver is almost\nzero. The same trend of variation against T indicates that the silver nanowire\nand bulk silver share the same phonon-electron scattering mechanism.\nAdditionally, due to phonon-assisted electron energy transfer across the grain\nboundaries, the Lorenz number of the silver nanowire is found much larger than\nthat of bulk silver and decreases with decreasing temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 17:35:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 23:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-18"}

Estimates for the stationary tail distribution\nof $\\{ Y_n \\}$ have been developed in the seminal papers of Kesten (1973) and\nGoldie (1991).

For example, the target distribution might be representable as the\n$L^2$-limit of a basis expansion in a suitable Hilbert space; or alternatively\nthe distribution of interest might be representable as the weak limit of a\nsequence of random variables, as in MCMC. Our main motivation comes from\ninfinite-dimensional models which can be parame- terised in terms of a series\nexpansion of basis functions (such as that given by a Karhunen-Loeve\nexpansion).

The\nauthors study behavioral motifs that are possible to observe at the dyadic\nlevel. The study shows significant differences between dyads that are more vs\nless engaged in the diffusion process. Dyads that fuel the diffusion proccess\nare characterized by stronger relationships (higher activity, more common\nfriends), more active and networked receiving party (higher centrality\nmeasures), and higher authority centrality of person sending a viral message.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 00:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-01"}

Our group successfully\ncontrolled the boron concentration and synthesized homoepitaxially grown\nsuperconducting diamond films by a CVD method. By CVD method, we found that\nsuperconductivity appears when the boron concentration (nB) exceeds a\nmetal-insulator transition concentration of 3.0x10^20 cm^-3 and its Tczero\nincreases up to 7.4 K with increasing nB. We additionally elucidated that the\nholes formed at the valence band are responsible for the metallic states\nleading to superconductivity. The calculations predicted that the hole doping\ninto the valence band induces strong attractive interaction and a rapid\nincrease in Tc with increasing boron concentration. According to the\ncalculations, if substitutional doped boron could be arranged periodically or\nthe degree of disorder is reduced, a Tc of approximately 100 K could be\nachieved via minimal percent doping. In this work, we have successfully\nobserved zero resistivity above 10 K and an onset of resistivity reduction at\n25.2 K in heavily B-doped diamond film. However, the effective carrier\nconcentration is similar to that of superconducting diamond with a lower Tc. We\nfound that the carrier has a longer mean free path and lifetime than previously\nreported, indicating that this highest Tc diamond has better crystallinity\ncompared to that of other superconducting diamond films. In addition, the\nsusceptibility shows a small transition above 20 K in the high quality diamond,\nsuggesting a signature of superconductivity above 20 K. These results strongly\nsuggest that heavier carrier doped defect-free crystalline diamond could give\nrise to high Tc diamond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 04:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-01"}

We propose a novel deep learning framework for attribute prediction\nin the wild. It cascades two CNNs, LNet and ANet, which are fine-tuned jointly\nwith attribute tags, but pre-trained differently. LNet is pre-trained by\nmassive general object categories for face localization, while ANet is\npre-trained by massive face identities for attribute prediction. This framework\nnot only outperforms the state-of-the-art with a large margin, but also reveals\nvaluable facts on learning face representation.\n  (1) It shows how the performances of face localization (LNet) and attribute\nprediction (ANet) can be improved by different pre-training strategies.\n  (2) It reveals that although the filters of LNet are fine-tuned only with\nimage-level attribute tags, their response maps over entire images have strong\nindication of face locations. This fact enables training LNet for face\nlocalization with only image-level annotations, but without face bounding boxes\nor landmarks, which are required by all attribute recognition works.\n  (3) It also demonstrates that the high-level hidden neurons of ANet\nautomatically discover semantic concepts after pre-training with massive face\nidentities, and such concepts are significantly enriched after fine-tuning with\nattribute tags. Each attribute can be well explained with a sparse linear\ncombination of these concepts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 07:13:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 06:05:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2015 13:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-25"}

We aim at characterising the gas content of protoplanetary discs in\nthe intermediate-aged Chamaeleon II (Cha II) star forming region.

We obtained Herschel-PACS line scan spectroscopic observations at 63\nmicrons of 19 Cha II Class I and II stars. The observations were used to trace\n[OI] and o-H2O at 63 microns. The analysis of the spatial distribution of [OI],\nwhen extended, can be used to understand the origin of the emission. We have\ndetected [OI] emission toward seven out of the nineteen systems observed, and\no-H2O emission at 63.32 microns in just one of them, Sz 61. Cha II members show\na correlation between [OI] line fluxes and the continuum at 70 microns, similar\nto what is observed in Taurus. We analyse the extended [OI] emission towards\nthe star DK Cha and study its dynamical footprints in the PACS Integral Field\nUnit (IFU). We conclude that there is a high velocity component from a jet\ncombined with a low velocity component with an origin that may be a combination\nof disc, envelope and wind emission. The stacking of spectra of objects not\ndetected individually in [OI] leads to a marginal 2.6sigma detection that may\nindicate the presence of gas just below our detection limits for some, if not\nall, of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 11:40:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The question\narises by which mechanisms turbulence is driven or sustained. It has been shown\nthat photoionising feedback from massive stars has an impact on the surrounding\nGMC and can for example create vast HII bubbles. We therefore address the\nquestion of whether turbulence is a consequence of this effect of feedback on\nthe cloud. To investigate this, we analyse the velocity field of simulations of\nhigh mass star forming regions by studying velocity structure functions and\npower spectra. We find that clouds whose morphology is strongly affected by\nphotoionising feedback also show evidence of driving of turbulence by\npreserving or recovering a Kolmogorov-type velocity field. On the contrary,\ncontrol run simulations without photoionising feedback have a velocity\ndistribution that bears the signature of gravitational collapse and of the\ndissipation of energy, where the initial Kolmogorov-type structure function is\nerased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 12:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-01"}

Here we report on giant anisotropic charge density oscillations\nfocused along specific directions with strong spin-filtering after scattering\nat an oxygen impurity embedded in the surface of a ferromagnetic thin film of\nFe grown on W(001). Utilizing density functional theory, we demonstrate that by\nchanging the thickness of the Fe films, we control quantum well states confined\nto two dimensions that manifest as multiple flat energy contours, impinging and\ntuning the strength of the induced charge oscillations which allow to detect\nthe oxygen impurity at large distances ($\\approx$ 50nm).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 13:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-01"}

Initially droplets, or in general aggregates, grow diffusively by\ncollecting supersaturation from the bulk phase. Subsequently, when the droplets\nhave grown to a size, where their Peclet number is of order unity, buoyancy\nsubstantially enhances droplet growth. The dynamics approaches a finite-time\nsingularity where the droplets are removed from the system by precipitation.\nThe two growth regimes are separated by a bottleneck of minimal droplet growth.\nHere, we present a low-dimensional model addressing the time span required to\ncross the bottleneck, and we hence determine the time, \\Delta t, from initial\ndroplet growth to rainfall. Our prediction faithfully captures the dependence\nof \\Delta t on the ramp rate of the droplet volume fraction, \\xi, the droplet\nnumber density, the interfacial tension, the mass diffusion coefficient, the\nmass density contrast of the coexisting phases, and the viscosity of the bulk\nphase. The agreement of observations and the prediction is demonstrated for\nmethanol/hexane and isobutoxyethanol/water mixtures where we determined \\Delta\nt for a vast range of ramp rates, \\xi, and temperatures. The very good\nquantitative agreement demonstrates that it is sufficient for binary mixtures\nto consider (i) droplet growth by diffusive accretion that relaxes\nsupersaturation, and (ii) growth by collisions of sedimenting droplets. An\nanalytical solution of the resulting model provides a quantitative description\nof the dependence of \\Delta t on the ramp rate and the material constants.\nExtensions of the model that will admit a quantitative prediction of \\Delta t\nin other settings are addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 14:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-01"}

Ever since the Nobel-prize winning works of\nDale and Loewi, it has been assumed that acetylcholine - subsequent to its\naction on a postsynaptic cell - is split into inactive by-products by\nacetylcholinesterase. Herein, this widespread assumption is falsified.\nExcitable cells (Chara australis internodes), which had previously been\nunresponsive to acetylcholine, became acetylcholine-sensitive in presence of\nacetylcholinesterase. The latter was evidenced by a striking difference in cell\nmembrane depolarisation upon exposure to 10 mM intact acetylcholine\n(deltaV=-2plus/minus5 mV) and its hydrolysate respectively\n(deltaV=81plus/minus19 mV) for 60 sec. This pronounced depolarization, which\nalso triggered action potentials, was clearly attributed to one of the\nhydrolysis products: acetic acid (deltaV=87plus/minus9 mV at pH 4.0; choline\nineffective in range 1-10 mM). In agreement with our findings, numerous studies\nin the literature have reported that acids excite gels, lipid membranes, plant\ncells, erythrocytes as well as neurons.

The functional performance of neural networks is\noften critically dependent on the level of correlations in the neural activity.\nIn finite networks, correlations are typically inevitable due to shared\npresynaptic input. Recent theoretical studies have shown that inhibitory\nfeedback, abundant in biological neural networks, can actively suppress these\nshared-input correlations and thereby enable neurons to fire nearly\nindependently.

We introduce the new concept of an exhausting family of\nrepresentations of a C*-algebra A. An {\\em exhausting family} of\nrepresentations of a C*-algebra A is a set F of representations of A with the\nproperty that every irreducible representation of A is weakly contained in some\n\\phi \\in F. An exhausting family F of representations of A has the property\nthat `\"a \\in A is invertible if, and if, \\phi(a) is invertible for any \\phi \\in\nF.\" Consequently, the spectrum of a is given by \\Spec(a) = \\cup_{\\phi \\in F}\n\\Spec(\\phi(a)). In other words, every exhausting family of representations is\ninvertibility sufficient, a concept introduced by Roch in 2003. We prove\nseveral properties of exhausting families and we provide necessary and\nsufficient conditions for a family of representations to be exhausting. Using\nresults of Ionescu and Williams (2009), we show that the regular\nrepresentations of amenable, second countable, locally compact groupoids with a\nHaar system form an exhausting family of representations. If $A$ is a separable\nC*-algebra, we show that a family F of representations of $A$ is exhausting if,\nand only if, it is invertibility sufficient. However, this result is not true,\nin general, for non-separable C*-algebras. With an eye towards applications, we\nextend our results to the case of unbounded operators. A typical application of\nour results is to parametric families of differential operators arising in the\nanalysis on manifolds with corners, in which case we recover the fact that a\nparametric operator F is invertible if, and only if, its Mellin transform is\ninvertible. In view of possible applications, we have tried to make this paper\naccessible to non-specialists in C*-algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 15:59:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Feb 2015 11:48:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2015 01:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 11:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

We consider a partially-relativistic\nmodel of self-gravitating BECs where the relation between the pressure and the\nrest-mass density is assumed to be quadratic (as in the case of classical BECs)\nbut pressure effects are taken into account in the relation between the energy\ndensity and the rest-mass density. At high densities, we get a stiff equation\nof state similar to the one considered by Zel'dovich (1961) in the context of\nbaryon stars in which the baryons interact through a vector meson field. We\ndetermine the maximum mass of general relativistic BEC stars described by this\nequation of state by using the formalism of Tooper (1965). This maximum mass is\nslightly larger than the maximum mass obtained by Chavanis and Harko (2012)\nusing a fully-relativistic model. We also consider the possibility that dark\nmatter is made of BECs and apply the partially-relativistic model of BECs to\ncosmology. In this model, we show that the universe experiences a stiff matter\nphase, followed by a dust matter phase, and finally by a dark energy phase\n(equivalent to a cosmological constant). The same evolution is obtained in\nZel'dovich (1972) model which assumes that initially, near the cosmological\nsingularity, the universe is filled with cold baryons. Interestingly, the\nFriedmann equations can be solved analytically in that case and provide a\nsimple generalization of the $\\Lambda$CDM model.

It is shown that mass depends on velocity as in Special\nRelativity, and that the velocity is constant for a particular characteristic\nvalue. In the limit of vanishing friction the theory satisfies a relativity\nprinciple as bodies do not decelerate and, therefore, the absolute frame\nbecomes unobservable. However, the limit theory is not Newtonian mechanics,\nwith its Galilei group symmetry, but rather Special Relativity. This result\nsuggests to regard Special Relativity as the limit of a theory presenting\nuniversal friction and exchange of mass-energy with a reservoir (vacuum). Thus,\nquite surprisingly, Special Relativity follows from the absolute space (ether)\nconcept and could have been discovered following studies of Aristotelian\nmechanics and friction. We end the work confronting the full theory with\nobservations.

A stiff matter era\nis present in the cosmological model of Zel'dovich (1972) where the primordial\nuniverse is assumed to be made of a cold gas of baryons. It also occurs in\ncertain cosmological models where dark matter is made of relativistic\nself-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). When the energy density of\nthe stiff matter is positive, the primordial universe is singular. It starts\nfrom a state with a vanishing scale factor and an infinite density. We consider\nthe possibility that the energy density of the stiff matter is negative\n(anti-stiff matter). This happens, for example, when the BECs have an\nattractive self-interaction. In that case, the primordial universe is\nnon-singular. It starts from a state in which the scale factor is finite and\nthe energy density is equal to zero. For the sake of generality, we consider a\ncosmological constant of arbitrary sign. When the cosmological constant is\npositive, the universe asymptotically reaches a de Sitter phase where the scale\nfactor increases exponentially rapidly. This can account for the accelerating\nexpansion of the universe that we observe at present. When the cosmological\nconstant is negative (anti-de Sitter), the evolution of the universe is cyclic.\nTherefore, depending on the sign of the energy density of the stiff matter and\nof the dark energy, we obtain singular and non-singular expanding or cyclic\nuniverses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 16:35:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}
