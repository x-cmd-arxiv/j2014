We study this problem using a global climate model including coupled\natmosphere, ocean, land, and sea-ice components as well as a continental ice\nsheet model driven by the climate model output. For a waterworld we find that\nsurface winds transport sea ice toward the day side and the ocean carries heat\ntoward the night side. As a result, night-side sea ice remains O(10 m) thick\nand night-side water trapping is insignificant. If a planet has large\ncontinents on its night side, they can grow ice sheets O(1000 m) thick if the\ngeothermal heat flux is similar to Earth's or smaller. Planets with a water\ncomplement similar to Earth's would therefore experience a large decrease in\nsea level when plate tectonics drives their continents onto the night side, but\nwould not experience complete day-side dessication. Only planets with a\ngeothermal heat flux lower than Earth's, much of their surface covered by\ncontinents, and a surface water reservoir O(10 %) of Earth's would be\nsusceptible to complete water trapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 16:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The thermodynamic\nstability of all structures as well as the electronic and chemical bonding\nproperties are addressed. For the monohydride, taking into account the\nzero-point energy is important to identify the octahedral Pd-H arrangement with\nits larger voids and, hence, softer hydrogen vibrational modes as favorable\nover the tetrahedral arrangement as found in the zincblende and wurtzite\nstructures. Stabilization of the rocksalt structure is due to strong bonding of\nthe 4d and 1s orbitals, which form a characteristic split-off band separated\nfrom the main d-band group. Increased filling of the formerly pure d states of\nthe metal causes strong reduction of the density of states at the Fermi energy,\nwhich undermines possible long-range ferromagnetic order otherwise favored by\nstrong magnetovolume effects. For the dihydride, octahedral Pd-H arrangement as\nrealized e.g. in the pyrite structure turns out to be unstable against\ntetrahedral arrangement as found in the fluorite structure.

When they\nare given, the problem of finding a corresponding curve is known as 'solving\nnatural equations'. Explicit solutions are known only for a handful of curve\nclasses, including notably the plane curves and general helices.\n  This paper shows constructively how to solve the natural equations explicitly\nfor an infinite series of curve classes. For every Frenet curve, a family of\nsuccessor curves can be constructed which have the tangent of the original\ncurve as principal normal. Helices are exactly the successor curves of plane\ncurves and applying the successor transformation to helices leads to slant\nhelices, a class of curves that has received considerable attention in recent\nyears as a natural extension of the concept of general helices.\n  The present paper gives for the first time a generic characterization of the\nslant helix in three-dimensional Euclidian space in terms of its curvature and\ntorsion, and derives an explicit arc-length parametrization of its tangent\nvector.

Usually, non-Hermitian terms are added,\non a phenomenological basis, to such networks to summarize the effects of the\ncoupling to the sinks. Here we consider a paradigmatic model of open quantum\nnetwork for which we derive a non-Hermitian effective model, discussing its\nlimit of validity by a comparison with the analysis of the full Hermitian\nmodel. Specifically, we consider a ring of sites connected to a central\none-dimensional lead. The lead acts as a sink which absorbs the excitation\ninitially present in the ring. The coupling strength to the lead controls the\nopening of the ring system. This model has been widely discussed in literature\nin the context of light-harvesting systems. We analyze the effectiveness of the\nnon-Hermitian description both in absence and in presence of static disorder on\nthe ring. In both cases, the non-Hermitian model is valid when the energy range\ndetermined by the eigenvalues of the ring Hamiltonian is smaller than the\nenergy band in the lead. Under such condition, we show that results about the\ninterplay of opening and disorder, previously obtained within the non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian approach, remain valid when the full Hermitian model in presence of\ndisorder is considered. The results of our analysis can be extended to generic\nnetworks with sinks, leading to the conclusion that the non-Hermitian approach\nis valid when the energy dependence of the coupling to the external\nenvironments is sufficiently smooth in the energy range spanned by the\neigenstates of the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 17:12:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Dec 2014 18:13:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 11:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-13"}

The projected sensitivities for next generation experiments are also\ngiven and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 17:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-18"}

We employ the underlying two-channel scattering model of\nFeshbach resonance where the closed channel is treated as a composite boson\nwith binding energy $\\varepsilon_0$ and the resonance is triggered by the\nmicroscopic interchannel coupling $U_{12}$. The binding energy $\\varepsilon_0$\nnaturally serves as an energy scale of the system, which has been sent to\ninfinity in the atom-molecule theory.

This information is\ncommonly summarized in a stand table, where a stand is defined as a group of\nforest trees of sufficiently uniform species composition, age, condition, or\nproductivity to be considered a homogeneous unit for planning purposes.\nTypically information used to construct stand tables is gleaned from observed\nsubsets of the forest selected using a probability-based sampling design. Such\nsampling campaigns are expensive and hence only a small number of sample units\nare typically observed. This data paucity means that stand tables can only be\nestimated for relatively large areal units. Contemporary forest management\nplanning and spatially explicit ecosystem models require stand table input at\nhigher spatial resolution than can be affordably provided using traditional\napproaches. We propose a dynamic multivariate Poisson spatial regression model\nthat accommodates both spatial correlation between observed diameter\ndistributions and also correlation between tree counts across diameter classes\nwithin each location.

To fully take into account the Klein-Nishina\neffect and two-photon annihilation process that are important at early times,\nwe perform detailed calculations including electromagnetic cascades. Our\nresults suggest that hard X-ray telescopes such as NuSTAR can observe such\nearly PWN emission by followup observations in months-to-years.

Detecting the signals will give us an interesting probe of\nparticle acceleration at early times of PWNe, as well as clues to driving\nmechanisms of luminous SNe and GRBs.

We also deduce a lot of important consequences.\n  True quantified Boolean formula is a generalisation of the Boolean\nSatisfiability Problem, where determining of interpretation that satisfies a\ngiven Boolean formula is replaced by existence of Boolean functions that makes\na given QBF to be tautology. Such functions are called the Skolem functions.\n  The essential idea of the proof is to show that for any quantified Boolean\nformula $\\phi$ we can obtain a formula $\\phi'$ which is in the 4th level of the\npolynomial hierarchy, no more than polynomial in the size of a given $\\phi$,\nsuch that the truth of $\\phi$ can be determined from the truth of $\\phi'$. The\nidea is to skolemize, and then use additional formulas from the 2nd level of\nthe polynomial hierarchy inside the skolemized prefix to enforce that the\nskolem variables indeed depend only on the universally quantified variables\nthey are supposed to. However, some dependence is lost when the quantification\nis reversed. It is called \"XOR issue\" because the functional dependence can be\nexpressed by means of an XOR formula. Thus, it is needed to locate these XORs,\nbut there is no need to locate all chains with XORs: any chain includes a XOR\nof only two variables. The last can be done locally in each iteration (keep in\nmind the algebraic normal form (ANF)), when all arguments are specified, i.e.\nas a polynomial subroutine.\n  Relativization is defeated due to the well-known fact: PH = PSPACE iff\nsecond-order logic over finite structures gains no additional power from the\naddition of a transitive closure operator.

A pre-clustering\nprocedure, namely protomeme detection, first isolates atomic tokens of\ninformation carried by the tweets. Protomemes are thereafter aggregated, based\non multiple similarity measures, to obtain memes as cohesive groups of tweets\nreflecting actual concepts or topics of discussion. The clustering algorithm\ntakes into account various dimensions of the data and metadata, including\nnatural language, the social network, and the patterns of information\ndiffusion. As a result, our system can build clusters of semantically,\nstructurally, and topically related tweets. The clustering process is based on\na variant of Online K-means that incorporates a memory mechanism, used to\n\"forget\" old memes and replace them over time with the new ones. The evaluation\nof our framework is carried out by using a dataset of Twitter trending topics.\nOver a one-week period, we systematically determined whether our algorithm was\nable to recover the trending hashtags. We show that the proposed method\noutperforms baseline algorithms that only use content features, as well as a\nstate-of-the-art event detection method that assumes full knowledge of the\nunderlying follower network.

With\nthe rise of mobile technology and ad blockers, many platforms are becoming\nincreasingly concerned about how to improve monetization through digital ads\nwhile improving viewer experience.\n  We study an online ad auction mechanism that incorporates a charge for ad\nimpact on user experience as a criterion for ad selection and pricing. Like a\nPigovian tax, the charge causes advertisers to internalize the hidden cost of\nforegone future platform revenue due to ad impact on user experience. Over\ntime, the mechanism provides an incentive for advertisers to develop ads that\nare effective while offering viewers a more pleasant experience. We show that\nadopting the mechanism can simultaneously benefit the publisher, advertisers,\nand viewers, even in the short term.\n  Incorporating a charge for ad impact can increase expected advertiser profits\nif enough advertisers compete. A stronger effectiveness-nuisance tradeoff,\nmeaning that ad effectiveness is more strongly associated with negative impact\non user experience, increases the amount of competition required for the\nmechanism to benefit advertisers. The findings suggest that the mechanism can\nbenefit the marketplace for ad slots that consistently attract many\nadvertisers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 21:38:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 06:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-27"}

In the first part, we address the enumeration of planar maps equipped\nwith a spanning forest, here called forested maps, with a weight $z$ per face\nand a weight $u$ per non-root component of the forest. Equivalently, we count\n(with respect to the number of faces) the planar maps $C$ weighted by\n$T_C(u+1,1)$, where $T_C$ is the Tutte polynomial of $C$. We begin by a purely\ncombinatorial characterization of the corresponding generating function,\ndenoted by $F(z,u)$. We deduce from this that $F(z,u)$ is differentially\nalgebraic in $z$, that is, satisfies a polynomial differential equation in $z$.\nFinally, for $u \\geq -1$, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the $n$th\ncoefficient of $F (z,u)$.

A possible channel for producing such\nmisaligned hot Jupiters involves Lidov-Kozai oscillations of the planet's\norbital eccentricity and inclination driven by a distant binary companion. In a\nrecent work (Storch, Anderson & Lai 2014), we have shown that a proto-hot\nJupiter undergoing Lidov-Kozai oscillations can induce complex, and often\nchaotic, evolution of the spin axis of its host star. Here we explore the\norigin of the chaotic spin behavior and its various features in an idealized\nnon-dissipative system where the secular oscillations of the planet's orbit are\nstrictly periodic. Using Hamiltonian perturbation theory, we identify a set of\nsecular spin-orbit resonances in the system, and show that overlaps of these\nresonances are responsible for the onset of wide-spread chaos in the evolution\nof stellar spin axis. The degree of chaos in the system depends on the\nadiabaticity parameter $\\epsilon$, proportional to the ratio of the Lidov-Kozai\nnodal precession rate and the stellar spin precession rate, and thus depends on\nthe planet mass, semi-major axis and the stellar rotation rate. For systems\nwith zero initial spin-orbit misalignment, our theory explains the occurrence\n(as a function of $\\epsilon$) of \"periodic islands\" in the middle of a \"chaotic\nocean\" of spin evolution, and the occurrence of restricted chaos in middle of\nregular/periodic spin evolution. Finally, we discuss a novel \"adiabatic\nresonance advection\" phenomenon, in which the spin-orbit misalignment, trapped\nin a resonance, gradually evolves as the adiabaticity parameter slowly changes.\nThis phenomenon can occur for certain parameter regimes when tidal decay of the\nplanetary orbit is included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 00:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

This hints at why mesons are colour neutral.\n  Furthermore, the Abelian restricted field contains two parts: a Maxwell term,\nand a topological term. The topological term can describe magnetic monopoles\nand other topological objects, which can be studied both numerically and\ntheoretically. By examining the topological part of the restricted field\nstrength we have found evidence suggesting that these objects, which will\ncontribute to confinement if present, are indeed there.\n  Previous studies have used simplifications, breaking the exact relationship\nbetween the restricted and QCD string tensions, but it was found that the\ntopological term dominated the restricted string tension.

We find that mergers, or\ncollisions, occur every 8-10 Myr (1/15th of an orbit) in a simulation with\nspiral arms, and once every 28 Myr (1/5th of an orbit) with no imposed spiral\narms.

Thus clouds can be expected to\nundergo between zero and a few collisions over their lifetime. We present\nspecific examples of cloud--cloud interactions in our results, including\nsynthetic CO maps.

It is shown that this paradox can be\nresolved by the action of the anomalous Doppler instability which enables fast\ncollective radiative relaxation, in the perpendicular direction, of electrons\naccelerated in the parallel direction by inductive electric fields generated by\nthe initial ELM instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 10:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-29"}

It has been a very\nuseful tool for handling large matrices. One limitation with the existing\nalgorithms for CUR matrix decomposition is that they need an access to the {\\it\nfull} matrix, a requirement that can be difficult to fulfill in many real world\napplications. In this work, we alleviate this limitation by developing a CUR\ndecomposition algorithm for partially observed matrices. In particular, the\nproposed algorithm computes the low rank approximation of the target matrix\nbased on (i) the randomly sampled rows and columns, and (ii) a subset of\nobserved entries that are randomly sampled from the matrix. Our analysis shows\nthe relative error bound, measured by spectral norm, for the proposed algorithm\nwhen the target matrix is of full rank. We also show that only $O(n r\\ln r)$\nobserved entries are needed by the proposed algorithm to perfectly recover a\nrank $r$ matrix of size $n\\times n$, which improves the sample complexity of\nthe existing algorithms for matrix completion.

The resulting\nresulting hardware descriptions are synthesized to an FPGA target, and then\ncharacterized for performance and resource utilization.

It is shown that this geometry,\nsuccessfully tested on profiles with bifurcated features, naturally solves\nseveral classical pulsar problems and avoids some difficulties of the\ntraditional nested cone/core model. This is best visible for profiles with\nseveral components, such as those of class T, Q and M, because they most\nclearly exhibit a range of effects previously interpreted within the conal\nmodel. In particular, with no reference to the flaring boundary of the polar\nmagnetic flux tube, the stream model explains the apparent radius-to-frequency\nmapping (RFM), including its reduced strength for the inner pair of components.\nThe lag of the central component (apparent `core') with respect to the\ncentroids of the flanking (`conal') components can also be naturally explained\nwith no reference to emission rings located at disparate altitudes. The stream\nmodel also reveals why the millisecond pulsars, despite their more strongly\nflaring magnetic field lines, do not exhibit as strong RFM as the normal\npulsars. The model is then successful in reproducing properties of so disparate\nobjects as the M-class and millisecond pulsars, including some peculiarities of\nthe latter. With no hesitation we, therefore, advance the view that pulsars\nhave fan beams generated by outflowing streams, whereas the nested cone/core\nbeams may well not exist at all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 11:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Dynamic range\nlimitations prevent simultaneous spectroscopy with a single instrument of all\nX-ray emitting regions of a flare. In addition, most X-ray observations so far\nare inconsistent with the high anisotropy predicted by the models usually\nadopted for solar flares.

The most frequent\ncause of human infection is Escherichia coli, which is dominated by sequence\ntype 131 (ST131), a set of rapidly radiating pandemic clones. The highly\ninfectious clades of ST131 originated firstly by a mutation enhancing virulence\nand adhesion. Secondly, single-nucleotide polymorphisms occurred enabling\nfluoroquinolone-resistance, which is near-fixed in all ST131. Thirdly, broader\nresistance through beta-lactamases has been gained and lost frequently,\nsymptomatic of conflicting environmental selective effects. This flexible\napproach to gene exchange is worrying and supports the proposition that ST131\nwill develop an even wider range of plasmid and chromosomal elements promoting\nantimicrobial resistance. To stymie ST131, deep genome sequencing is required\nto understand the origin, evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance\ngenes.

These sites are expected to be present on a realistic Pt\nsurface and show enhanced catalytic activity. The use of a naturally chiral\nsurface also enables us to study potential chiral selectivity effects of the\nreaction at the same time.

However, full probabilistic inference in this\nmodel is analytically intractable, so that computationally intensive techniques\nsuch as Gibb's sampling are required. As a result, DPM-based methods, which\nhave considerable potential, are restricted to applications in which\ncomputational resources and time for inference is plentiful. For example, they\nwould not be practical for digital signal processing on embedded hardware,\nwhere computational resources are at a serious premium. Here, we develop\nsimplified yet statistically rigorous approximate maximum a-posteriori (MAP)\ninference algorithms for DPMs. This algorithm is as simple as K-means\nclustering, performs in experiments as well as Gibb's sampling, while requiring\nonly a fraction of the computational effort. Unlike related small variance\nasymptotics, our algorithm is non-degenerate and so inherits the \"rich get\nricher\" property of the Dirichlet process. It also retains a non-degenerate\nclosed-form likelihood which enables standard tools such as cross-validation to\nbe used. This is a well-posed approximation to the MAP solution of the\nprobabilistic DPM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 15:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-05"}

Over time these changes can result in an imperfect\ntracking of taxonomic perspectives through the re-/use of Code-compliant or\ninformal names. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a novel approach\nfor aligning taxonomies through the interaction of human experts and logic\nreasoners. We explore the performance of this approach with the Perelleschus\nuse case of Franz & Cardona-Duque (2013). The use case includes six taxonomies\npublished from 1936 to 2013, 54 taxonomic concepts (i.e., circumscriptions of\nnames individuated according to their respective source publications), and 75\nexpert-asserted Region Connection Calculus articulations (e.g., congruence,\nproper inclusion, overlap, or exclusion). An Open Source reasoning toolkit is\nused to analyze 13 paired Perelleschus taxonomy alignments under heterogeneous\nconstraints and interpretations. The reasoning workflow optimizes the logical\nconsistency and expressiveness of the input and infers the set of maximally\ninformative relations among the entailed taxonomic concepts. The latter are\nthen used to produce merge visualizations that represent all congruent and\nnon-congruent taxonomic elements among the aligned input trees. In this small\nuse case with 6-53 input concepts per alignment, the information gained through\nthe reasoning process is on average one order of magnitude greater than in the\ninput. The approach offers scalable solutions for tracking provenance among\nsucceeding taxonomic perspectives that may have differential biases in naming\nconventions, phylogenetic resolution, ingroup and outgroup sampling, or\nostensive (member-referencing) versus intensional (property-referencing)\nconcepts and articulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 20:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The core has an extraordinarily\nlarge mass ($\\sim1.1 \\times 10^4$ $M_\\odot$) and size ($\\sim2 \\times 5$\npc$^2$), but there is no massive young star forming therein. We observed this\ncore in various molecular lines such as C$^{18}$O($J=1-0$) using the 45m\ntelescope at Nobeyama Radio Observatory. We find that the core has an elongated\nmorphology consisting of several filaments and core-like structures. The\nfilaments are massive ($10^2-10^3$ $M_\\odot$), and they are apparently\ncolliding against each other. Some candidates of YSOs are distributed around\ntheir intersection, suggesting that the collisions of the filaments may have\ninfluenced on their formation. To understand the formation and evolution of\nsuch colliding filaments, we performed numerical simulations using the adaptive\nmesh refinement (AMR) technique adopting the observed core parameters (e.g.,\nthe mass and size) as the initial conditions. Results indicate that the\nfilaments are formed as seen in other earlier simulations for small cores in\nliterature, but we could not reproduce the collisions of the filaments simply\nby assuming the large initial mass and size. We find that the collisions of the\nfilaments occur only when there is a large velocity gradient in the initial\ncore in a sense to compress it. We suggest that the observed core was actually\ncompressed by an external effect, e.g., shocks of nearby supernova remnants\nincluding HB21 which has been suggested to be interacting with the Cyg OB 7\nmolecular cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 15:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Independent Poisson clocks\nof rate 1 are associated with the vertices of $G$. Initially, one vertex of $G$\nknows the rumour. Whenever the clock of a vertex $x$ rings, it calls a random\nneighbour $y$: if $x$ knows the rumour and $y$ does not, then $x$ tells $y$ the\nrumour (a push operation), and if $x$ does not know the rumour and $y$ knows\nit, $y$ tells $x$ the rumour (a pull operation). The average spread time of $G$\nis the expected time it takes for all vertices to know the rumour, and the\nguaranteed spread time of $G$ is the smallest time $t$ such that with\nprobability at least $1-1/n$, after time $t$ all vertices know the rumour. The\nsynchronous variant of this protocol, in which each clock rings precisely at\ntimes $1,2,\\dots$, has been studied extensively. We prove the following results\nfor any $n$-vertex graph: In either version, the average spread time is at most\nlinear even if only the pull operation is used, and the guaranteed spread time\nis within a logarithmic factor of the average spread time, so it is $O(n\\log\nn)$. In the asynchronous version, both the average and guaranteed spread times\nare $\\Omega(\\log n)$. We give examples of graphs illustrating that these bounds\nare best possible up to constant factors. We also prove theoretical\nrelationships between the guaranteed spread times in the two versions. Firstly,\nin all graphs the guaranteed spread time in the asynchronous version is within\nan $O(\\log n)$ factor of that in the synchronous version, and this is tight.\nNext, we find examples of graphs whose asynchronous spread times are\nlogarithmic, but the synchronous versions are polynomially large. Finally, we\nshow for any graph that the ratio of the synchronous spread time to the\nasynchronous spread time is $O(n^{2/3})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2014 15:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2015 03:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-17"}

Both the intra- and inter-cluster\nedge densities vanish when the size of the graph grows large, making the\ncluster reconstruction problem nosier and hence difficult to solve. We are\ninterested in scenarios where the network size is very large, so that the\nadjacency matrix of the graph is hard to manipulate and store. The data stream\nmodel in which columns of the adjacency matrix are revealed sequentially\nconstitutes a natural framework in this setting. For this model, we develop two\nnovel clustering algorithms that extract the clusters asymptotically\naccurately. The first algorithm is {\\it offline}, as it needs to store and keep\nthe assignments of nodes to clusters, and requires a memory that scales\nlinearly with the network size. The second algorithm is {\\it online}, as it may\nclassify a node when the corresponding column is revealed and then discard this\ninformation. This algorithm requires a memory growing sub-linearly with the\nnetwork size.

Specifically, Light argued that in order to demonstrate\ncommunicative competence, individuals who required AAC had to develop and\nintegrate knowledge, judgment, and skills in four interrelated domains:\nlinguistic, operational, social, and strategic. In 2003, Light expanded this\ndefinition and argued that the attainment of communicative competence is\ninfluenced not just by linguistic, operational, social, and strategic\ncompetencies, but also by a variety of psychosocial factors (e.g., motivation,\nattitude, confidence, resilience) as well as by barriers and supports in the\nenvironment. In the 25 years since this definition of communicative competence\nfor individuals who use AAC was originally proposed, there have been\nsignificant changes in the AAC field. In this paper, we review the preliminary\ndefinition of communicative competence proposed 25 years ago, consider the\nchanges in the field, and then revisit the proposed definition to determine if\nit is still relevant and valid for this new era of communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 17:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

These clusters may correspond to\nemerging themes, popular topics, or breaking news stories in a corpus.\nTherefore, recently there has been increased interest in the problem of\nclustering dynamic data. However, there exists little support for the\ninteractive exploration of the output of these analysis techniques,\nparticularly in cases where researchers wish to simultaneously explore both the\nchange in cluster structure over time and the change in the textual content\nassociated with clusters. In this paper, we propose a model for tracking\ndynamic clusters characterized by the evolutionary events of each cluster.\nMotivated by this model, the TextLuas system provides an implementation for\ntracking these dynamic clusters and visualizing their evolution using a metro\nmap metaphor. To provide overviews of cluster content, we adapt the tag cloud\nrepresentation to the dynamic clustering scenario. We demonstrate the TextLuas\nsystem on two different text corpora, where they are shown to elucidate the\nevolution of key themes. We also describe how TextLuas was applied to a problem\nin bibliographic network research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Nov 2014 19:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-07"}
