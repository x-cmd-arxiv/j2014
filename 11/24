More specifically, we consider\nsystems whose response to the input signal is given by a weighted superposition\nof delayed and Doppler shifted versions of the input. This problem arises in a\nmultitude of applications such as wireless communications and radar imaging.\nDue to practical constraints, the input signal has finite bandwidth B, and the\nreceived signal is observed over a finite time interval of length T only. This\ngives rise to a delay and Doppler resolution of 1/B and 1/T. We show that this\nresolution limit can be overcome, i.e., we can exactly recover the continuous\ndelay-Doppler pairs and the corresponding attenuation factors, by solving a\nconvex optimization problem. This result holds provided that the distance\nbetween the delay-Doppler pairs is at least 2.37/B in time or 2.37/T in\nfrequency. Furthermore, this result allows the total number of delay-Doppler\npairs to be linear up to a log-factor in BT, the dimensionality of the response\nof the system, and thereby the limit for identifiability. Stated differently,\nwe show that we can estimate the time-frequency components of a signal that is\nS-sparse in the continuous dictionary of time-frequency shifts of a random\nwindow function, from a number of measurements, that is linear up to a\nlog-factor in S.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 17:56:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Feb 2015 23:07:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2015 21:29:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 22:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-11"}

More often than not, a drug-like compound (ligand) can be\npromiscuous - that is, it can interact with more than one target protein. In\nrecent years, in in silico target prediction methods the promiscuity issue has\nbeen approached computationally in different ways. In this study we confine\nattention to the so-called ligand-based target prediction machine learning\napproaches, commonly referred to as target-fishing. With a few exceptions, the\ntarget-fishing approaches that are currently ubiquitous in cheminformatics\nliterature can be essentially viewed as single-label multi-classification\nschemes; these approaches inherently bank on the single target paradigm\nassumption that a ligand can home in on one specific target. In order to\naddress the ligand promiscuity issue, one might be able to cast target-fishing\nas a multi-label multi-class classification problem. For illustrative and\ncomparison purposes, single-label and multi-label Naive Bayes classification\nmodels (denoted here by SMM and MMM, respectively) for target-fishing were\nimplemented.

Rev. Lett. 40 667; Braginskii et al\n1980 Science 209 547). Such modulated or stroboscopic observation leading to a\nsqueezed state of one quadrature of the oscillator motion with the quantum\nnoise below that of the zero-point fluctuations has been a long-standing goal.\nHere, we report on the generation of a quadrature-squeezed state of an\noscillator by stroboscopic back-action evading measurement. The oscillator is\nthe collective spin of an atomic ensemble precessing in magnetic field. It is\ninitially prepared in nearly the ground state with an average thermal occupancy\nnumber $0.08 \\pm 0.01$. The oscillator is coupled to the optical mode of a\ncavity, and the cavity output field detected with polarization homodyning\nserves as the meter. A back-action-evading measurement is performed by\nstroboscopically modulating the intensity of the light field at twice the\nLarmor frequency, resulting in a squeezed state conditioned on the\nlight-polarization measurement with $2.2 \\pm 0.3$ dB noise reduction below the\nzero-point fluctuations for the measured quadrature. The demonstrated squeezing\nholds promise for metrological advantage in quantum sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 19:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-20"}

The consequences of the\nsize-dependent and compositional variations in a-C(:H), from aliphatic-rich\na-C:H to aromatic-rich a-C, are studied within the context of the interstellar\ndust extinction and emission. Methods. Newly-derived optical property data for\na-C(:H) materials, combined with that for an amorphous forsterite-type silicate\nwith iron nano-particle inclusions, a-SilFe, are used to explore dust evolution\nin the interstellar medium.

Most existing spectral clustering algorithms\nintegrate dimensionality reduction into the clustering process assisted by\nmanifold learning in the original space. However, the manifold in\nreduced-dimensional subspace is likely to exhibit altered properties in\ncontrast with the original space. Thus, applying manifold information obtained\nfrom the original space to the clustering process in a low-dimensional subspace\nis prone to inferior performance. Aiming to address this issue, we propose a\nnovel convex algorithm that mines the manifold structure in the low-dimensional\nsubspace. In addition, our unified learning process makes the manifold learning\nparticularly tailored for the clustering. Compared with other related methods,\nthe proposed algorithm results in more structured clustering result. To\nvalidate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we perform extensive\nexperiments on several benchmark datasets in comparison with some\nstate-of-the-art clustering approaches. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed algorithm has quite promising clustering performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 22:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

If an MDS code has\n$r$ parities and no more than $r$ erasures occur, then by transmitting all the\nremaining data in the code, the original information can be recovered. However,\nit was shown that in order to recover a single symbol erasure, only a fraction\nof $1/r$ of the information needs to be transmitted. This fraction is called\nthe repair bandwidth (fraction). Explicit code constructions were given in\nprevious works. If we view each symbol in the code as a vector or a column over\nsome field, then the code forms a 2D array and such codes are especially widely\nused in storage systems. In this paper, we address the following question:\ngiven the length of the column $l$, number of parities $r$, can we construct\nhigh-rate MDS array codes with optimal repair bandwidth of $1/r$, whose code\nlength is as long as possible?

Epistasis\nis critical for understanding many genetic and evolutionary processes,\nincluding pathway organization, evolution of sexual reproduction, mutational\nload, ploidy, genomic complexity, speciation, and the origin of life.\nNevertheless, current understandings for the genome-wide distribution of\nepistasis are mostly inferred from interactions among one mutant type per gene,\nwhereas how epistatic interaction partners change dynamically for different\nmutant alleles of the same gene is largely unknown. Here we address this issue\nby combining predictions from flux balance analysis and data from a recently\npublished high-throughput experiment. Our results show that different alleles\ncan epistatically interact with very different gene sets. Furthermore, between\ntwo random mutant alleles of the same gene, the chance for the allele with more\nsevere mutational consequence to develop a higher percentage of negative\nepistasis than the other allele is 50-70% in eukaryotic organisms, but only\n20-30% in bacteria and archaea. We developed a population genetics model that\npredicts that the observed distribution for the sign of epistasis can speed up\nthe process of purging deleterious mutations in eukaryotic organisms.

The resolution of this\napparent violation of the equivalence principle is that it is necessary to\nallow for evolution of the velocities with time, and also, when considering\nperturbations on the scale of the observer-source separation, to include the\ngravitational redshift effect. We provide an expression for $\\delta d / d$ that\nprovides a physically consistent way to measure peculiar velocities and\ndetermine their impact for SN1a cosmology.\n  2) We then calculate the perturbation to the redshift as a function of source\nflux density, which has been proposed as an alternative probe of large-scale\nmotions. We show how the inclusion of surface brightness modulation modifies\nthe relation between $\\delta z(m)$ and the peculiar velocity, and that, while\nthe noise properties of this method might appear promising, the velocity signal\nis swamped by the effect of galaxy clustering for most scales of interest.\n  3) We show how, in linear theory, peculiar velocity measurements are biased\ndownwards by the effect of smaller scale motions or by measurement errors (such\nas in photometric redshifts).

Understanding the\nglobal epistatic landscape is vital for many genetic and evolutionary theories.\nCurrent knowledge for epistatic dynamics under multiple conditions is limited\nby the technological difficulties in experimentally screening epistatic\nrelations among genes. We explored this issue by applying flux balance analysis\nto simulate epistatic landscapes under various environmental perturbations.\nSpecifically, we looked at gene-gene epistatic interactions, where the\nmutations were assumed to occur in different genes. We predicted that epistasis\ntends to become more positive from glucose-abundant to nutrient-limiting\nconditions, indicating that selection might be less effective in removing\ndeleterious mutations in the latter. We also observed a stable core of\nepistatic interactions in all tested conditions, as well as many epistatic\ninteractions unique to each condition. Interestingly, genes in the stable\nepistatic interaction network are directly linked to most other genes whereas\ngenes with condition-specific epistasis form a scale-free network. Furthermore,\ngenes with stable epistasis tend to have similar evolutionary rates, whereas\nthis co-evolving relationship does not hold for genes with condition-specific\nepistasis.

In the\nminimal model, the mixture of the septet $\\eta$ and the scalar doublet in the\nstandard model (SM) is driven by a non-Hermitian dimension-7 operator. For a\nsmaller bare mass of the septet, $\\Delta S$ gives a stringent constraint on the\nmixing angle $\\sin\\beta$ between the CP-odd neutral parts of the SM Higgs\ndoublet and $\\eta$.

Apart\nfrom the contribution by the septet-doublet admixture, $\\Delta S$ is suppressed\nby a factor of $s_W^2$ and $\\Delta T$ has a significant constraint due to the\nvanishing vacuum polarization of $Z$ at the momentum transfer $p^2=0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 03:53:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2015 03:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-16"}

In particular we\nnote that for samples extending to low stellar mass limits\n($<10^{10}\\mathcal{M_{\\odot}}$) the S\\'ersic index bimodality, evident for high\nmass systems, becomes less distinct and no-longer acts as a reliable separator\nof early- and late-type systems. The final set of stellar mass $-$ half-light\nradius relations are reported for a variety of galaxy population subsets in 10\nbands ($ugrizZYJHK_s$) and are intended to provide a comprehensive low-z\nbenchmark for the many ongoing high-z studies. Exploring the variation of the\nstellar mass $-$ half-light radius relations with wavelength we confirm earlier\nfindings that galaxies appear more compact at longer wavelengths albeit at a\nsmaller level than previously noted: at $10^{10}\\mathcal{M_{\\odot}}$ both\nspiral systems and ellipticals show a decrease in size of 13% from $g$ to $K_s$\n(which is near linear in log wavelength). Finally we note that the sizes used\nin this work are derived from 2D S\\'ersic light profile fitting (using\nGALFIT3), i.e., elliptical semi-major half light radii, improving on earlier\nlow-z benchmarks based on circular apertures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 06:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

Redundancy elimination results in traffic reduction which in turn\nimproves the efficiency of network links. In this paper, the concept of network\ncompression is introduced that aspires to exploit the statistical correlation\nbeyond removing large duplicate strings from the flow to better suppress\nredundancy.\n  In the first part of the paper, we introduce \"memory-assisted compression\",\nwhich utilizes the memorized content within the network to learn the statistics\nof the information source generating the packets which can then be used toward\nreducing the length of codewords describing the packets emitted by the source.\nUsing simulations on data gathered from real network traces, we show that\nmemory-assisted compression can result in significant traffic reduction.\n  In the second part of the paper, we study the scaling of the average\nnetwork-wide benefits of memory-assisted compression. We discuss routing and\nmemory placement problems in network for the reduction of overall traffic. We\nderive a closed-form expression for the scaling of the gain in Erdos-Renyi\nrandom network graphs, where obtain a threshold value for the number of\nmemories deployed in a random graph beyond which network-wide benefits start to\nshine.

Recently, there is mounting evidence that features\nfrom deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are setting new records for\nvarious vision applications. On the other hand, considering the continuous\ncharacteristic of the depth values, depth estimations can be naturally\nformulated into a continuous conditional random field (CRF) learning problem.\nTherefore, we in this paper present a deep convolutional neural field model for\nestimating depths from a single image, aiming to jointly explore the capacity\nof deep CNN and continuous CRF. Specifically, we propose a deep structured\nlearning scheme which learns the unary and pairwise potentials of continuous\nCRF in a unified deep CNN framework.\n  The proposed method can be used for depth estimations of general scenes with\nno geometric priors nor any extra information injected.

However, if these electrons loose their energy by the\nsynchrotron and inverse-Compton, the spectrum of secondary electrons is too\nsoft, and an additional arbitrary component of primary electrons is necessary\nin order to reproduce the radio data. Thus, a mixture of the hadronic and\nleptonic models is required for the observed radio flux. It was shown that if\nthe spectrum of primary electrons is $\\propto E_e^{-2}$, the permitted range of\nthe magnetic field strength is within 2 - 7 $\\mu$G region.

Alternatively, the electrons in the FBs\nmay lose their energy by adiabatic energy losses if there is a strong plasma\noutflow in the GC.

Most, if not all, % FVC implementations employ the\nGaussian mixture model (GMM) to characterize the generation process of local\nfeatures. This choice has shown to be sufficient for traditional low\ndimensional local features, e.g., SIFT; and typically, good performance can be\nachieved with only a few hundred Gaussian distributions. However, the same\nnumber of Gaussians is insufficient to model the feature space spanned by\nhigher dimensional local features, which have become popular recently. In order\nto improve the modeling capacity for high dimensional features, it turns out to\nbe inefficient and computationally impractical to simply increase the number of\nGaussians. In this paper, we propose a model in which each local feature is\ndrawn from a Gaussian distribution whose mean vector is sampled from a\nsubspace. With certain approximation, this model can be converted to a sparse\ncoding procedure and the learning/inference problems can be readily solved by\nstandard sparse coding methods. By calculating the gradient vector of the\nproposed model, we derive a new fisher vector encoding strategy, termed Sparse\nCoding based Fisher Vector Coding (SCFVC). Moreover, we adopt the recently\ndeveloped Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) descriptor as a high\ndimensional local feature and implement image classification with the proposed\nSCFVC. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only\nsignificantly outperforms the traditional GMM based Fisher vector encoding but\nalso achieves the state-of-the-art performance in generic object recognition,\nindoor scene, and fine-grained image classification problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 10:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

These are correlated: the strongest Fe\nK features are seen during deep dips in the light curves of complex NLS1s.\nThere are two competing explanations for these features, one where a compact\nX-ray source on the spin axis of a highly spinning black hole approaches the\nhorizon and the consequent strong relativistic effects focus the intrinsic flux\nonto the inner edge of a thin disc, giving a dim, reflection dominated\nspectrum. The other is that the deep dips are caused by complex absorption by\nclumps close to the hard X-ray source. The reflection dominated model is able\nto reproduce the very short 30s soft lag from reverberation seen in the complex\nNLS1 1H0707-495. However, it does not explain the characteristic switch to hard\nlags on longer timescales. Instead, a full model of propagating fluctuations\ncoupled to reverberation can explain the switch in the simple NLS1 PG1244+026\nusing a low spin black hole. However PG1244+026 has a longer reverberation lag\nof $\\sim 200$s.\n  Here we extend the successful propagation-reverberation model for the simple\nNLS1 PG1244+026 to include the effect of absorption from clumps in a turbulent\nregion above the disk. The resulting occultations of the inner accretion flow\ncan introduce additional hard lags when relativistic effects are taken into\naccount. This dilutes the soft lag from reverberation and shifts it to higher\nfrequencies, making a smooth transition between the 200s lags seen in simple\nNLS1s to the 30s lags in complex NLS1s. These two classes of NLS1 could then be\ndetermined by inclination angle with respect to a clumpy, probably turbulent,\nfailed wind structure on the disc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 12:10:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 10:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The location of the separatrix\nbetween the Dean vortices, induced by centrifugal force, is dependent on the\nlocation of the maxima of axial velocity. An asymmetry in the axial velocity\nprofile can change the location of the separatrix. This is achieved physically\nby introducing slip alternatingly at the top and bottom walls.

The extent of mixing, for low slip and low Reynolds numbers, is shown to\nbe greater when Dean vortices in adjacent half cells are counter-rotating.

We study\nthe symmetries and zeros of the Hilbert polynomial associated to $(M,J)$, which\nimply many rigidity results for the Chern numbers when $k_0\\neq 1$.\n  We apply these results to the category of compact, connected symplectic\nmanifolds. A long-standing question posed by McDuff and Salamon, also known as\nthe `McDuff conjecture', asked about the existence of non-Hamiltonian actions\nwith isolated fixed points. This question was answered recently by Tolman, with\nan explicit construction of a six-dimensional manifold with such an action. One\nissue that this raises is whether one can find topological criteria that ensure\nthe manifold can only support a Hamiltonian or only a non-Hamiltonian action.\nIn this vein, we are able to deduce such criteria from our rigidity theorems in\nterms of relatively few Chern numbers, depending on the index. This improves\nupon results of Feldman for which one needs to know the entire Todd genus.\n  Another consequence of our work is that, in the situation above with a\nHamiltonian action, the minimal Chern number coincides with the index and is at\nmost $n+1$, mirroring results of Michelsohn in the complex category and Hattori\nin the almost complex category.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 14:13:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 13:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

To address this\nlack, as a first contribution, this paper introduces the notion of proximity\ngraph between computing nodes. If two nodes are connected in this graph, their\noperations must satisfy a strong consistency condition, while the operations\ninvoked by other nodes are allowed to satisfy a weaker condition.

For both stars, we\nconsistently detected the signature of a weak (<30 G in absolute value)\nlongitudinal magnetic field. We determined the physical parameters of both\nstars and characterise their X-ray spectrum. For beta CMa, our mode\nidentification analysis led to determining a rotation period of 13.6+/-1.2 days\nand of an inclination angle of the rotation axis of 57.6+/-1.7 degrees, with\nrespect to the line of sight. On the basis of these measurements and assuming a\ndipolar field geometry, we derived a best fitting obliquity of ~22 degrees and\na dipolar magnetic field strength (Bd) of ~100 G (60<Bd<230 G within 1 sigma),\nbelow what is typically found for other magnetic massive stars.

In the case of the\nminimal value of the total angular momentum, $j=0$, the radial equations are\nreduced to second-order ordinary differential equations, which are\nstraightforwardly solved in terms of the hypergeometric functions.

The model consists of a new peridynamics operator along with\nnonlocal interface conditions. The new peridynamics interface model converges\nto the classical interface model of linear elasticity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 23:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-27"}

In crowded environments occlusions and false detections\nare common, and although there have been substantial advances in recent years,\ntracking is still a challenging task. Tracking is typically divided into two\nsteps: detection, i.e., locating the pedestrians in the image, and data\nassociation, i.e., linking detections across frames to form complete\ntrajectories.\n  For the data association task, approaches typically aim at developing new,\nmore complex formulations, which in turn put the focus on the optimization\ntechniques required to solve them. However, they still utilize very basic\ninformation such as distance between detections.

We find\nthat on an average during 'drought' (low ISMR) periods in India, GCR flux is\ndecreasing, and during 'flood' (high ISMR) periods, GCR flux is increasing. The\nresults of our analysis suggest for a possibility that the decreasing GCR flux\nduring the summer monsoon season in India may suppress the rainfall. On the\nother hand, increasing GCR flux may enhance the rainfall. We suspect that in\naddition to real environmental conditions, significant levitation/dispersion of\nlow clouds and hence reduced possibility of collision/coalescence to form\nraindrops suppresses the rainfall during decreasing GCR flux in monsoon season.\nOn the other hand, enhanced collision/coalescence efficiency during increasing\nGCR flux due to electrical effects may contribute to enhancing the rainfall.\nBased on the observations, we put forward the idea that, under suitable\nenvironmental conditions, changing GCR flux may influence precipitation by\nsuppressing/enhancing it, depending upon the decreasing/increasing nature of\nGCR flux variability during monsoon season in India, at least. We further note\nthat the rainfall variability is inversely related to the temperature variation\nduring ISMR season. We suggest an explanation, although speculative, how a\ndecreasing/increasing GCR flux can influence the rainfall and the temperature.\nWe speculate that the proposed hypothesis, based on the Indian climate data can\nbe extended to whole tropical and sub-tropical belt, and that it may contribute\nto global temperature in a significant way. If correct, our hypothesis has\nimportant implication for the sun - climate link.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 17:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-03"}

An analysis that is relied on\ntwo fundamental CS principles; the Uniform Random Sampling (URS) and the\nUncertainty Principle (UP), is presented. We show that CS on a single- and\nmulti-band signals performs better if the URS is done only within the band and\nsuppress the out-band parts, compared to ordinary URS that ignore the band\nlimits. It means that sampling should only be done at the signal support, while\nthe non-support should be masked and suppressed in the reconstruction process.\nWe also show that for an N-length discrete time signal with K-number of\nfrequency components (Fourier coefficients), given the knowledge of the\nspectrum, URS leads to exact sampling on the location of the K-spectral peaks.\nThese results are used to formulate a sampling scheme when the boundaries of\nthe bands are not sharply distinguishable, such as in a triangular- or a\nstacked-band- spectral signals. When analyzing these cases, CS will face a\nparadox; in which narrowing the band leads to a more number of required\nsamples, whereas widening it leads to lessen the number. Accordingly; instead\nof signal analysis by dividing the signal's spectrum vertically into bands of\nfrequencies, slicing horizontally magnitude-wise yields less number of required\nsample and better reconstruction results. Moreover, it enables sample reuse\nthat reduces the sample number even further. The horizontal slicing and sample\nreuse methods imply non-uniform random sampling, where larger-magnitude part of\nthe spectrum should be allocated more sample than the lower ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 09:17:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-22"}

Most of these repeat a\nsingle untested hypothesis regarding physical mechanisms by which elasmobranchs\ndetect magnetic fields and also neglect careful consideration of\nmagnetoreception in teleosts. Several species of teleosts are known to have\nmagnetoreception based in biogenic magnetite, and direct magnetic field\ndetection also has support in several species of elasmobranchs. The overly\nnarrow focus of earlier papers on the unsupported hypothesis that\nmagnetoreception in elasmobranchs is based in the ampullae of Lorenzini creates\nthe impression that all teleosts will be insensitive to magnetic deterrents.\nHowever, magnetite based magnetoreception has been demonstrated in several\nteleosts, and is supported in others. Furthermore, electroreception is present\nin many teleost species; therefore, the possibility of induction based indirect\nmagnetoreception should be considered. Finally, experiments reported as\ndemonstrating insensitivity in teleost species to magnetic deterrents suffer\nfrom inadequate design and sample sizes to reject the hypothesis of magnetic\ndetection in any given species. Since adoption of deterrent hook technologies\ndepends on both deterrent effects in sharks and the absence of effects in\ntarget teleosts, the hypothesis of detection in teleost species must be\nindependently tested with adequate sample sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 15:52:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-29"}
