The proposed\nscheme utilizes Integer Forcing Linear Receiver (IFLR) at relay, which uses\nequations, i.e., linear integer-combinations of messages, to harness the\nintra-pair interference. Accordingly, we propose the design of mean squared\nerror (MSE) based transceiver, including precoder and projection matrices for\nthe relay and users, assuming that the perfect channel state information (CSI)\nis available. In this regards, in the multiple-access phase, we introduce two\nnew MSE criteria for the related precoding and filter designs, i.e., the sum of\nthe equations MSE (Sum-Equation MSE) and the maximum of the equations MSE\n(Max-Equation MSE), to exploit the equations in the relay. In addition, the\nconvergence of the proposed criteria is proven as well. Moreover, in the\nbroadcast phase, we use the two traditional MSE criteria, i.e. the sum of the\nusers' mean squred errors (Sum MSE) and the maximum of the users' mean squared\nerrors (Max MSE), to design the related precoding and filters for recovering\nrelay's equations by the users. Then, we consider a more practical scenario\nwith imperfect CSI. For this case, IFLR receiver is modified, and another\ntransceiver design is proposed, which take into account the effect of channels\nestimation error. We evaluate the performance of our proposed strategy and\ncompare the results with the conventional amplify-and-forward (AF) and\ndenoise-and-forward (DF) strategies for the same scenario.

We consider the Perturbed Power Law (PPL)\nmodel of inflation which is a soft deviation from Power Law (PL) inflationary\nmodel. This model captures the effect of higher order derivative of Hubble\nparameter during inflation, which in turn leads to a non-zero effective mass\n$m_{\\rm eff}$ for the inflaton field. The higher order derivatives of Hubble\nparameter at leading order sources constant difference in the spectral index\nfor scalar and tensor perturbation going beyond PL model of inflation. PPL\nmodel have two observable independent parameters, namely spectral index for\ntensor perturbation $\\nu_t$ and change in spectral index for scalar\nperturbation $\\nu_{st}$ to explain the observed features in the scalar and\ntensor power spectrum of perturbation. From the recent measurements of CMB\npower spectra by WMAP, Planck and BICEP-2 for temperature and polarization, we\nestimate the feasibility of PPL model with standard $\\Lambda$CDM model.\nAlthough BICEP-2 claimed a detection of $r=0.2$, estimates of dust\ncontamination provided by Planck have left open the possibility that only upper\nbound on $r$ will be expected in a joint analysis.

The\nanalogous realization question for the larger class of exchange rings is also\nof interest. A refinement monoid is said to be wild if it cannot be expressed\nas a direct limit of finitely generated refinement monoids. In this paper, we\nconsider the problem of realizing some concrete wild refinement monoids by\nregular rings and by exchange rings. The most interesting monoid we consider is\nthe monoid M obtained by successive refinements of the identity\nx_0+y_0=x_0+z_0. This monoid is known to be realizable by the algebra A = K[F]\nof the monogenic free inverse monoid F, for any choice of field K, but A is not\nan exchange ring. We show that, for any uncountable field K, M is not\nrealizable by a regular K-algebra, but that a suitable universal localization\nof A provides an exchange, non-regular, K-algebra realizing M. For any\ncountable field F, we show that a skew version of the above construction gives\na regular F-algebra realizing M. Finally, we develop some connections with the\nAtiyah Problem for the lamplighter group G (the wreath product of Z/2Z by Z).\nWe prove that the algebra A can be naturally seen as a *-subalgebra of the\ngroup algebra KG, for any complex subfield K closed under conjugation, and we\ndetermine the structure of the *-regular closure of A in the regular ring of G.\nUsing this, we show that the subgroup of R generated by the von Neumann\ndimensions of matrices over KG contains the rational field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 18:27:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2015 07:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-29"}

They may need to run (and test) on restrictive HPC platforms. They\nalmost certainly face time and budget pressures that can keep testing\nlanguishing near the bottom of their to-do lists. This paper presents DDTS, a\nframework for building test suite applications, designed to fit\nscientific-software projects' requirements. DDTS aims to simplify introduction\nof rigorous testing, and to ease growing pains as needs mature. It decomposes\nthe testing problem into practical, intuitive phases; makes configuration and\nextension easy; is portable and suitable to HPC platforms; and exploits\nparallelism. DDTS is currently used for automated regression and developer\npre-commit testing for several scientific-software projects with disparate\ntesting requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 18:45:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 22:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

In this note, we\ndiscuss various aspects of how inferring the energy scale of inflation is\ncomplicated by the fact that the effective strength of gravity as seen by\ninflationary quanta necessarily differs from that seen by gravitational\nexperiments at presently accessible scales. The uncertainty in the former\nrelative to the latter has to do with the unknown spectrum of universally\ncoupled particles between laboratory scales and the putative scale of\ninflation.

The total flux associated with ARs reached maximum in the north in\n2011, more than two years earlier than the south; the maximum is significantly\nweaker than Cycle 23. The process of polar field reversal is relatively slow,\nnorth-south asymmetric, and episodic.

First-principles density functional calculations are\nperformed for the dense and dilute adatom coverage limits. The dense limit is\nrepresented by the single-side semifluorinated graphene, which is a metal with\nspin-orbit splittings of about 10 meV. To simulate the effects of a single\nadatom, we also calculate the electronic structure of a $10 \\times 10$\nsupercell, with one fluorine atom in the top position. Since this dilute limit\nis useful to study spin transport and spin relaxation, we also introduce a\nrealistic effective hopping Hamiltonian, based on symmetry considerations,\nwhich describes the supercell bands around the Fermi level.

Furthermore, the magnitude of the induced\nspin-orbit coupling due to fluorine adatoms is about $1000$ times more than\nthat of pristine graphene, and 10 times more than that of hydrogenated\ngraphene. Also unlike hydrogen, the fluorine adatom is not a narrow resonant\nscatterer at the Dirac point.

In this work we simulate the 244\nsq. deg coadd images and catalogs in 5 bands for the DES Science Verification\n(SV) data. The simulation output is compared with the corresponding data to\nshow that major characteristics of the images and catalogs can be captured. We\nalso point out several directions of future improvements. Two practical\nexamples, star/galaxy classification and proximity effects on object detection,\nare then used to demonstrate how one can use the simulations to address\nsystematics issues in data analysis. With clear understanding of the\nsimplifications in our model, we show that one can use the simulations\nside-by-side with data products to interpret the measurements. This forward\nmodelling approach is generally applicable for other upcoming and future\nsurveys. It provides a powerful tool for systematics studies which is\nsufficiently realistic and highly controllable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 21:49:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2015 16:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-12"}

We use these identities to derive a set of consistency\nrelations between bispectra and power spectra of cosmological perturbations in\ndifferent gauges. Without additional assumptions, these consistency relations\njust seem to reflect the redundancy implied by diffeomorphisms.

A social planner, who is likely to be more\nrisk neutral than agents because it operates at a longer time-scale, quantifies\nsocial cost with the total expected delay along routes. From that perspective,\nagents may make suboptimal decisions that degrade long-term quality. We define\nthe {\\em price of risk aversion} (PRA) as the worst-case ratio of the social\ncost at a risk-averse Wardrop equilibrium to that where agents are\nrisk-neutral.

We discuss whether variability on this\ntimescale can plausibly explain proplyd size data on a case by case basis. We\nalso show that the predicted radio free-free emission signature of X-ray\nproplyds is readily detectable. Monitoring is however required to distinguish\nsuch emission from non-thermal emission from active coronae. We also predict\nthat it is only at $> 1$ pc from $\\theta_1$C that the free-free emission from\nsuch offset ionised structures would be clearly distinguishable from an\nexternally driven ionised disc wind.

However, these algorithms are typically not practical. In 1976, Wolfe\nproposed an algorithm to find the minimum Euclidean norm point in a polytope,\nand in 1980, Fujishige showed how Wolfe's algorithm can be used for SFM. For\ngeneral submodular functions, this Fujishige-Wolfe minimum norm algorithm seems\nto have the best empirical performance.\n  Despite its good practical performance, very little is known about Wolfe's\nminimum norm algorithm theoretically. To our knowledge, the only result is an\nexponential time analysis due to Wolfe himself. In this paper we give a maiden\nconvergence analysis of Wolfe's algorithm.

Recent high resolution cosmological simulations show that a\nprotostellar disk forms as a consequence of gravitational collapse and\nfragments into multiple clumps. However, it is not entirely clear if these\nclumps will be able to survive to form multiple stars as simulations are unable\nto follow the disk evolution for longer times. In this study, we employ a\nsimple analytical model to derive the properties of marginally stable\nsteady-state disks.

For $0.06 < \\alpha_{crit} < 1$,\nthe disk can be unstable for both accretion rates. The comparison of the\nmigration and the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scales shows that clumps are expected\nto migrate inward before reaching the main sequence. Furthermore, in the\npresence of a massive central star the clumps within the central 1 AU will be\ntidally disrupted.

Our\nobjective in this study was to assess metabolic diversity in sesame by\nnontargeted metabolic profiling and elucidate the relationship between\nmetabolic and genome diversity in this crop. Results: Ten sesame accessions\nwere selected that represent most of the genome diversity of sesame grown in\nIndia, Western Asia, Sudan and Venezuela based on previous AFLP studies.\nEthanolic seed extracts were separated by HPLC, metabolites were ionized by\npositive and negative electrospray and ions were detected with an ion trap mass\nspectrometer in full-scan mode for m/z from 50 to 1000.

The relationship between biodiversity at the genome and at\nthe metabolome levels was assessed by correlation analysis and multivariate\nstatistics. Conclusion: Patterns of diversity at the genomic and metabolic\nlevels differed, indicating that selection played a significant role in the\nevolution of metabolic diversity in sesame. This result implies that when used\nfor the selection of genotypes in breeding and conservation, diversity\nassessment based on neutral DNA markers should be complemented with metabolic\nprofiles.

Results: We developed\nprocedures for the conversion of DDRT-PCR data into quantitative transcription\nprofiles. Amplified cDNA fragments are separated on a DNA sequencer. Data\nprocessing consists of four steps: (i) cDNA bands in lanes corresponding to\nsamples treated with the same primer combination are matched in order to\nidentify fragments originating from the same transcript, (ii) intensity of\nbands is determined by densitometry, (iii) densitometric values are normalized,\nand (iv) intensity ratio is calculated for each pair of corresponding bands.\nTranscription profiles are represented by sets of intensity ratios (control vs.\ntreatment) for cDNA fragments defined by primer combination and DNA mobility.\nWe demonstrated the procedure by analyzing DDRT-PCR data on the effect of\nsecondary metabolites of oilseed rape Brassica napus on the transcriptome of\nthe pathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria maculans.

In our analysis we find that PPC\ncomponents have properties very different from that of outer conal emission.\nThe separation of the PPC components from the main pulse center remains\nconstant with frequency. In addition the beam opening angles corresponding to\nthe separation of PPC components from the pulsar center are much larger than\nthe largest encountered in conal emission. Pulsar radio emission is believed to\noriginate within the magnetic polar flux tubes due to the growth of\ninstabilities in the outflowing relativistic plasma. Observationally, there is\nstrong evidence that the main pulse emission originates at altitudes of about\n50 neutron star radii for a canonical pulsar. Currently, the most plausible\nradio emission model that can explain main pulse emission is the coherent\ncurvature radiation mechanism, wherein relativistic charged solitons are formed\nin a non-stationary electron-positron-pair plasma. The wider beam opening\nangles of PPC require the emission to emanate from larger altitudes as compared\nto the main pulse, if both these components originate by the same emission\nmechanism.

This trend--cycle decomposition has a relevant impact on\nseveral economic and fiscal variables and constitutes by itself an important\nindicator for policy purposes. This paper deals with trend--cycle decomposition\nfor the Italian economy having some interesting peculiarities which makes it\nattractive to analyse from both a statistic and an historical perspective. We\npropose an univariate model for the quarterly real GDP, subsequently extended\nto include the price dynamics through a Phillips curve. This study considers a\nseries of the Italian quarterly real GDP recently released by OECD which\nincludes both the 1960s and the recent global financial crisis of 2007--2008.\nParameters estimate as well as the signal extraction are performed within the\nBayesian paradigm which effectively handles complex models where the parameters\nenter the log--likelihood function in a strongly nonlinear way. A new Adaptive\nIndependent Metropolis--within--Gibbs sampler is then developed to efficiently\nsimulate the parameters of the unobserved cycle. Our results suggest that\ninflation influences the Output Gap estimate, making the extracted Italian OG\nan important indicator of inflation pressures on the real side of the economy,\nas stated by the Phillips theory. Moreover, our estimate of the sequence of\npeaks and troughs of the Output Gap is in line with the OECD official dating of\nthe Italian business cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Nov 2014 14:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

We address this theoretical gap by introducing a model for online\nrecommendation systems, cast item recommendation under the model as a learning\nproblem, and analyze the performance of a cosine-similarity collaborative\nfiltering method. In our model, each of $n$ users either likes or dislikes each\nof $m$ items. We assume there to be $k$ types of users, and all the users of a\ngiven type share a common string of probabilities determining the chance of\nliking each item. At each time step, we recommend an item to each user, where a\nkey distinction from related bandit literature is that once a user consumes an\nitem (e.g., watches a movie), then that item cannot be recommended to the same\nuser again. The goal is to maximize the number of likable items recommended to\nusers over time. Our main result establishes that after nearly $\\log(km)$\ninitial learning time steps, a simple collaborative filtering algorithm\nachieves essentially optimal performance without knowing $k$. The algorithm has\nan exploitation step that uses cosine similarity and two types of exploration\nsteps, one to explore the space of items (standard in the literature) and the\nother to explore similarity between users (novel to this work).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 19:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

This\nsimply implies that fractal is a shape that it would still look the same even\nif somebody could zoom in on one of its parts an infinite number of times. This\nproperty is also called self-similarity with several applications including\nnano pharmacology and drug nano carriers. We are interested in the study of the\nproperties of fractal aggregates in a microgravity environment above an\norbiting spacecraft. To model the effect we use a complete expression for the\ngravitational acceleration. In particular on the surface of the Earth the\nacceleration is corrected for the effect of oblateness and rotation. In the\ngravitational acceleration the effect of oblateness can be modeled with the\ninclusion of a term that contains the J2 harmonic coefficient, as well as a\nterm that depends on the square of angular velocity of the Earth. In orbit the\nacceleration of gravity at the point of the spacecraft is a function of the\norbital elements and includes only in our case the J2 harmonic since no\ncoriolis force is felt by the spacecraft. Using the fitting parameter d = 3.0\nwe have found that the aggregate monomer number N is not significantly affected\nand exhibits a minute 0.0001% difference between the geocentric and areocentric\nlatitudes of 90 degrees and 0 degrees. Finally for circular and elliptical\norbits around Earth and Mars of various inclinations and eccentricities the\naggregate monomer number is not affected at all at the orbital altitude of 300\nkm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Oct 2014 18:44:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-05-29"}
