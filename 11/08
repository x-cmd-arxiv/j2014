These combine with phase factors to\ntake care of all the dependence of the solution on $x^{i}$ and $% dx^{i}$ for\neach $\\partial /\\partial x^{i}=0$ symmetry. The maximum number of idempotents\n(each for a one-parameter group) that can, therefore, go into a solution is the\ndimensionality $n$ of the space. This number is further limited by\nnon-commutativity of idempotents.\n  We consider the tensor product of Kaehler algebra with tangent Clifford\nalgebra, i.e. of valuedness. It has a commutative subalgebra of \"mirror\nelements\", i.e. where the valuedness is dual to the differential form (like in\n$dx\\mathbf{i}$, but not in $dx\\mathbf{j}$). It removes the aforementioned\nlimitation in the number of idempotent factors that can simultaneously go into\na solution.\n  In the Kaehler calculus, which is based on the Kaehler algebra, total angular\nmomentum is linear in its components, even it is not valued in tangent algebra.\nIn particular, it is not a vector operator.\n  We carry Kaehler's treatment over to the aforementioned commutative algebra.\nNon-commutativity thus ceases to be a limiting factor in the formation of\nproducts of idempotents representing each a one-parameter symmetry. The\ninterplay of factors that emerges in the expanded set of such products is\ninimical to operator theory. For practical reasons, we stop at products\ninvolving three one-parameter idempotents ---henceforth call ternary--- even\nthough the dimensionality of the all important spacetime manifold allows for\nfour of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 16:12:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Dec 2014 03:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-11"}

Their characteristics\nhave been so far related to reptation transport caused by the impacts on the\nground of grains entrained by the wind into saltation. By means of direct\nnumerical simulations of grains interacting with a wind flow, we show that the\ninstability turns out to be driven by resonant grain trajectories, whose length\nis close to a ripple wavelength and whose splash leads to a mass displacement\ntowards the ripple crests. The pattern selection results from a compromise\nbetween this destabilizing mechanism and a diffusive downslope transport which\nstabilizes small wavelengths. The initial wavelength is set by the ratio of the\nsediment flux and the erosion/deposition rate, a ratio which increases linearly\nwith the wind velocity. We show that this scaling law, in agreement with\nexperiments, originates from an interfacial layer separating the saltation zone\nfrom the static sand bed, where momentum transfers are dominated by mid-air\ncollisions. Finally, we provide quantitative support for the use the\npropagation of these ripples as a proxy for remote measurements of sediment\ntransport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 16:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In this paper, we first find for two Rossi X-ray Timing\nExplorer (RXTE) observations of the BHB GRS 1915+105 that the QPO has a well\ndefined average waveform. That is, the phase difference and amplitude ratios\nbetween the first two harmonics vary tightly around a well defined mean. This\nenables us to reconstruct QPO waveforms in each energy channel, in order to\nconstrain QPO phase-resolved spectra. We fit these phase resolved spectra\nacross 16 phases with a model including Comptonisation and reflection (Gaussian\nand smeared edge components) to find strong spectral pivoting and a modulation\nin the iron line equivalent width. The latter indicates the observed reflection\nfraction is changing throughout the QPO cycle. This points to a geometric QPO\norigin, although we note that the data presented here do not entirely rule out\nan alternative interpretation of variable disc ionisation state.

Leading models relate SGRBs to a relativistic jet\nlaunched by the BH-torus system resulting from the merger. However, recent\nobservations have revealed a large fraction of SGRB events accompanied by X-ray\nafterglows with durations $\\sim10^2\\!-\\!10^5~\\mathrm{s}$, suggesting continuous\nenergy injection from a long-lived central engine, which is incompatible with\nthe short ($\\lesssim1~\\mathrm{s}$) accretion timescale of a BH-torus system.\nThe formation of a supramassive NS, resisting the collapse on much longer\nspin-down timescales, can explain these afterglow durations, but leaves serious\ndoubts on whether a relativistic jet can be launched at merger. Here we present\na novel scenario accommodating both aspects, where the SGRB is produced after\nthe collapse of a supramassive NS. Early differential rotation and subsequent\nspin-down emission generate an optically thick environment around the NS\nconsisting of a photon-pair nebula and an outer shell of baryon-loaded ejecta.\nWhile the jet easily drills through this environment, spin-down radiation\ndiffuses outwards on much longer timescales and accumulates a delay that allows\nthe SGRB to be observed before (part of) the long-lasting X-ray signal.

The >10^7 K brightness\ntemperature required for an mJIVE detection cannot be achieved via star\nformation alone, allowing us to unambiguously detect nearby radio AGN and study\ntheir role in galaxy evolution. Radio AGN are an order of magnitude more common\nin early-type galaxies (ETGs) than in their late-type counterparts. The\nVLBI-detected ETGs in this study have a similar stellar mass distribution to\ntheir undetected counterparts, are typically not the central galaxies of\nclusters and exhibit merger fractions that are significantly higher than in the\naverage ETG. This suggests that these radio AGN (which have VLBI luminosities\n>10^22 W Hz^-1) are primarily fuelled by mergers, and not by internal stellar\nmass loss or cooling flows. Our radio AGN are a factor of ~3 times more likely\nto reside in the UV-optical red sequence than the average ETG. Furthermore,\ntypical AGN lifetimes (a few 10^7 yr) are much shorter than the transit times\nfrom blue cloud to red sequence (~1.5 Gyr). This indicates that the AGN are not\ntriggered promptly and appear several dynamical timescales into the associated\nstar formation episode, implying that they typically couple only to residual\ngas, at a point where star formation has already declined significantly. While\nevidence for AGN feedback is strong in systems where the black hole is fed by\nthe cooling of hot gas, AGN triggered by mergers appear not to strongly\nregulate the associated star formation. The inability of the AGN to rapidly\nquench merger-driven star formation is likely to make merging the dominant mode\nof star formation in nearby ETGs, in line with evidence for minor mergers being\nthe primary driver of stellar mass growth in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 21:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-15"}

With this article we would like to draw attention\nto another source of new physics in Higgs+jet observables: the triple gluon\noperator $O_{3g}$ (consisting of three factors of the gluon field strength\ntensor). We compute the distortions of kinematic distributions in Higgs+jet\nproduction at a 14 TeV LHC due to $O_{3g}$ and compare them with the\ndistortions due to dimension six operators involving the Higgs doublet. We find\nthat the transverse momentum, the jet rapidity and the difference between the\nHiggs and jet rapidity are well suited to distinguish between the contributions\nfrom $O_{3g}$ and those from other operators, and that the size of the\ndistortions are similar if the Wilson coefficients are of the same order as the\nexpected bounds from other observables.

The coefficient of the\ninflaton term in the superpotential has to be tuned small to avoid conflict\nwith Kahler moduli stabilisation. To allow such a tuning, this coefficient\nnecessarily depends on further complex structure moduli. At large values of the\ninflaton field, these moduli are then in danger of backreacting too strongly.\nTo avoid this, further tunings are necessary. In weakly coupled type IIB theory\nat the orientifold point, implementing these tunings appears to be difficult if\nnot impossible. However, fourfolds or models with mobile D7-branes provide\nenough structural freedom. We calculate the resulting inflaton potential and\nstudy the feasibility of the overall tuning given the limited freedom of the\nflux landscape.

Such fluctuations have been\nempirically observed in the retail market for gasoline, in airline pricing and\nin the online sale of consumer goods. Motivated by this, we study a model of\nprice competition in which an equilibrium rarely exists. We seek to analyze the\nwelfare, despite the nonexistence of an equilibrium, and present welfare\nguarantees as a function of the market power of the sellers.\n  We first study best response dynamics in markets with sellers that provide a\nhomogeneous good, and show that except for a modest number of initial rounds,\nthe welfare is guaranteed to be high. We consider two variations: in the first\nthe sellers have full information about the valuation of the buyer. Here we\nshow that if there are $n$ items available across all sellers and $n_{\\max}$ is\nthe maximum number of items controlled by any given seller, the ratio of the\noptimal welfare to the achieved welfare will be at most\n$\\log(\\frac{n}{n-n_{\\max}+1})+1$. As the market power of the largest seller\ndiminishes, the welfare becomes closer to optimal. In the second variation we\nconsider an extended model where sellers have uncertainty about the buyer's\nvaluation. Here we similarly show that the welfare improves as the market power\nof the largest seller decreases, yet with a worse ratio of\n$\\frac{n}{n-n_{\\max}+1}$. The exponential gap in welfare between the two\nvariations quantifies the value of accurately learning the buyer valuation.\n  Finally, we show that extending our results to heterogeneous goods in general\nis not possible. Even for the simple class of $k$-additive valuations, there\nexists a setting where the welfare approximates the optimal welfare within any\nnon-zero factor only for $O(1/s)$ fraction of the time, where $s$ is the number\nof sellers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 21:16:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2015 15:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-28"}

To date, most work has\nfocused on recovering the spherically averaged power spectrum of the 21 cm\nsignal, since this approach maximizes the signal-to-noise in the initial\nmeasurement. However, like galaxy surveys, the 21 cm signal is affected by\nredshift space distortions, and is inherently anisotropic between the\nline-of-sight and transverse directions. A measurement of this anisotropy can\nyield unique cosmological information, potentially even isolating the matter\npower spectrum from astrophysical effects. However, in interferometric\nmeasurements, foregrounds also have an anisotropic footprint between the\nline-of-sight and transverse directions: the so-called foreground \"wedge\".\nAlthough foreground subtraction techniques are actively being developed, a\n\"foreground avoidance\" approach of simply ignoring contaminated modes has\narguably proven most successful to date. In this work, we analyze the effect of\nthis foreground anisotropy in recovering the redshift space distortion\nsignature in 21 cm measurements at both high and intermediate redshifts. We\nfind the foreground wedge corrupts nearly all of the redshift space signal for\neven the largest proposed EoR experiments (HERA and the SKA), making\ncosmological information unrecoverable without foreground subtraction. The\nsituation is somewhat improved at lower redshifts, where the redshift-dependent\nmapping from observed coordinates to cosmological coordinates significantly\nreduces the size of the wedge.

Existing\napproaches to solving this problem focus on the case where the number of items\nare small, or admit some underlying structure -- it is unclear, however, if\ngood recommendation is possible when dealing with content-rich settings with\nunstructured content.\n  We consider this problem under a simple natural model, wherein the number of\nitems and the number of item-views are of the same order, and an `access-graph'\nconstrains which user is allowed to see which item. Our main insight is that\nthe presence of the access-graph in fact makes good recommendation possible --\nhowever this requires the exploration policy to be designed to take advantage\nof the access-graph. Our results demonstrate the importance of `serendipity' in\nexploration, and how higher graph-expansion translates to a higher quality of\nrecommendations; it also suggests a reason why in some settings, simple\npolicies like Twitter's `Latest-First' policy achieve a good performance.\n  From a technical perspective, our model presents a way to study\nexploration-exploitation tradeoffs in settings where the number of `trials' and\n`strategies' are large (potentially infinite), and more importantly, of the\nsame order. Our algorithms admit competitive-ratio guarantees which hold for\nthe worst-case user, under both finite-population and infinite-horizon\nsettings, and are parametrized in terms of properties of the underlying graph.\nConversely, we also demonstrate that improperly-designed policies can be highly\nsub-optimal, and that in many settings, our results are order-wise optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2014 22:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

In addition,\nmore complex questions of interest, such as effects of treatment on the treated\nand mediated effects may not always be identified even in data where treatment\nassignment is known and under investigator control, or may be identified under\none causal model but not another.\n  Increasingly complex effects of interest, coupled with a diversity of causal\nmodels in use resulted in a fragmented view of identification. This\nfragmentation makes it unnecessarily difficult to determine if a given\nparameter is identified (and in what model), and what assumptions must hold for\nthis to be the case. This, in turn, complicates the development of estimation\ntheory and sensitivity analysis procedures.\n  In this paper, we give a unifying view of a large class of causal effects of\ninterest in terms of a hierarchy of interventions, and show that identification\ntheory for this large class reduces to an identification theory of random\nvariables under interventions from this hierarchy. Moreover, we show that one\ntype of intervention in the hierarchy is naturally associated with queries\nidentified under the Finest Fully Randomized Causally Interpretable Structure\nTree Graph (FFRCISTG) model of Robins (via the extended g-formula), and another\nis naturally associated with queries identified under the Non-Parametric\nStructural Equation Model with Independent Errors (NPSEM-IE) of Pearl, via a\nmore general functional we call the edge g-formula.\n  Our results motivate the study of estimation theory for the edge g-formula,\nsince we show it arises both in mediation analysis, and in settings where\ntreatment assignment has unobserved causes, such as models associated with\nPearl's front-door criterion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Nov 2014 15:29:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Dec 2014 15:24:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2015 21:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-17"}

A well-known approach is to consider sparse signals that\nhave fewer nonzero frequency components compared to the highest frequency\ncomponent.

A cognitive dynamic system is suggested as a proper\nchoice for the supervisory system.
