We extend the\ndefinition of the zero-divisor graphs of commutative semigroups to not\nnecessarily commutative semigroups. We define an annihilating-ideal graph of a\nring as a special type of zero-divisor graph of a semigroup. We introduce two\nways to define the zero-divisor graphs of semigroups. The first definition\ngives a directed graph ${\\Gamma}(S)$, and the other definition yields an\nundirected graph $\\overline{{\\Gamma}}(S)$. It is shown that $\\Gamma(S)$ is not\nnecessarily connected, but $\\overline{{\\Gamma}}(S)$ is always connected and\n${\\rm diam}(\\overline{\\Gamma}(S))\\leq 3$. For a ring $R$ define a directed\ngraph $\\Bbb{APOG}(R)$ to be equal to $\\Gamma(\\Bbb{IPO}(R))$, where\n$\\Bbb{IPO}(R)$ is a semigroup consisting of all products of two one-sided\nideals of $R$, and define an undirected graph $\\overline{\\Bbb{APOG}}(R)$ to be\nequal to $\\overline{\\Gamma}(\\Bbb{IPO}(R))$.

To resolve the dynamics of\nthe S under its self-gravity and under the influence of the halo, we introduce\na novel approach using post-collapse Lagrangian perturbation theory. This\napproach allows us to follow the evolution of the system between successive\ncrossing times and to describe in an iterative way the interplay between the\ncentral S and the halo. Our theoretical predictions are checked against\nmeasurements in entropy conserving numerical simulations based on the waterbag\nmethod. While our post-collapse Lagrangian approach does not allow us to\ncompute rigorously the long term behavior of the system, i.e. after many\ncrossing times, it explains the close to power-law behavior of the projected\ndensity observed in numerical simulations. Pushing the model at late time\nsuggests that the system could build at some point a very small flat core, but\nthis is very speculative. This analysis shows that understanding the dynamics\nof initially cold systems requires a fine grained approach for a correct\ndescription of their very central part.

Previously it has been shown\nthat conversion of this primordially-generated background of relativistic\nALPs---a cosmic ALP background (CAB)---can explain the observed soft X-ray\nexcess in both the centre and the outskirts of the Coma cluster. Here we extend\nthis work to the three clusters A665, A2199 and A2255. We use a stochastic\nmodel of the cluster magnetic field to numerically calculate ALP-photon\nconversion probabilities to predict the CAB-generated soft X-ray flux in these\nclusters. We compare this flux to ROSAT PSPC observations of the three\nclusters, and use these observations to constrain the CAB parameter space. We\nfind the CAB can reproduce the magnitude of the observed excess in A2199 and\nA2255 for the same CAB parameters that match the observed soft excess in the\nComa cluster. We also find good fit to the morphology of the excesses in these\nclusters. Simulation of CAB conversion in the cluster A665 is in mild tension\nwith the other clusters due to producing a small but observable excess at large\nradii where none is observed. This tension is alleviated considering the\nuncertainty on predicting the count rate in the ROSAT detector, and on the\nsystematics affecting the magnetic field determination.

Until recently it was believed that in multi-cellular massive MIMO\nsystem, even in the asymptotic regime, as the number of service antennas tends\nto infinity, the performance is limited by directed inter-cellular\ninterference. This interference results from unavoidable re-use of reverse-link\ntraining sequences (pilot contamination) by users in different cells.\n  We devise a new concept that leads to the effective elimination of inter-cell\ninterference in massive MIMO systems. This is achieved by outer multi-cellular\nprecoding, which we call Large-Scale Fading Precoding (LSFP). The main idea of\nLSFP is that each base station linearly combines messages aimed to users from\ndifferent cells that re-use the same training sequence. Crucially, the\ncombining coefficients depend only on the slow-fading coefficients between the\nusers and the base stations. Each base station independently transmits its\nLSFP-combined symbols using conventional linear precoding that is based on\nestimated fast-fading coefficients. Further, we derive estimates for downlink\nand uplink SINRs and capacity lower bounds for the case of massive MIMO systems\nwith LSFP and a finite number of base station antennas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Nov 2014 20:25:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

To consider practically implementable methods, we study in this\npaper interference reduction based on precoding using the large-scale fading\ncoefficients that depend on the path-loss model and are independent of a\nspecific antenna. We focus on the downlink multi-cell precoding designs when\neach BS is equipped with a practically finite number of antennas. In this\noperation regime, pilot contamination is not the dominant source of\ninterference, and mitigation of all types of interference is required. This\npaper uses an optimization approach to design precoding methods for equal\nqualities of service (QoS) to all users in the network, i.e.,maximizing the\nminimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) among all users.

We first resolve an old conjecture of Alon and Frankl, showing\nthat $c(n,m) = o(m^2)$ when $m = n^{\\omega(1)} 2^{n/2}$. We also obtain more\naccurate bounds for $c(n,m)$ for sparse and dense families, characterise the\nextremal constructions for certain values of $m$, and sharpen some other known\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Nov 2014 23:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

For G=GL_n certain\nsmooth open substacks of this compactification have already appeared in the\nwork of Drinfeld and of L. Lafforgue on the Langlands correspondence for\nfunction fields. The Drinfeld-Lafforgue-Vinberg compactification is however\nalready singular for G=SL_2; questions about its singularities arise naturally\nin the geometric Langlands program, and form the topic of the present article.\n  Drinfeld's definition of the compactification for a general reductive group G\nrelies on the Vinberg semigroup of G, and will be given in [Sch]. In the\npresent paper we focus on the case G=SL_2. In this case the compactification\ncan alternatively be viewed as a canonical one-parameter degeneration of the\nmoduli space of SL_2-bundles. We study the singularities of this degeneration\nvia the weight-monodromy theory of its nearby cycles: We give an explicit\ndescription of the nearby cycles sheaf in terms of certain novel perverse\nsheaves which we call \"Picard-Lefschetz oscillators\" and which govern the\nsingularities of the degeneration.

Due to some of the biological properties, bacteria have been\nproposed as a possible information carrier for molecular communication, and the\ncorresponding communication networks are known as \\textit{bacterial\nnanonetworks}. The biological properties include the ability for bacteria to\nmobilize between locations and carry the information encoded in\nDeoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) molecules. However, similar to most organisms,\nbacteria have complex social properties that govern their colony. These social\ncharacteristics enable the bacteria to evolve through various fluctuating\nenvironmental conditions by utilizing cooperative and non-cooperative\nbehaviors. This article provides an overview of the different types of\ncooperative and non-cooperative social behavior of bacteria. The challenges\n(due to non-cooperation) and the opportunities (due to cooperation) these\nbehaviors can bring to the reliability of communication in bacterial\nnanonetworks are also discussed. Finally, simulation results on the impact of\nbacterial cooperative social behavior on the end-to-end reliability of a\nsingle-link bacterial nanonetwork are presented.

However,\nseveral applications involve finite and relative small parameters, for which\nthe above approximations may be inaccurate. Recently, via a small noise\nperturbation approach with fixed dimension and degrees of freedom, Johnstone\nand Nadler derived simple yet accurate stochastic approximations to the\ndistribution of Roy's largest root in the real valued case, under a rank-one\nalternative.

In general, nonlinearities can cause complex behavior of the\nsystem such multi-stability and chaos. However, even phase locking may be\nguaranteed under any initial conditions, the transient behavior of the circuit\ncan be unsatisfactory due to the cycle slipping. Growth of the phase error\ncaused by cycle slipping is undesirable, leading e.g. to demodulation and\ndecoding errors. This makes the problem of estimating the phase error\noscillations and number of slipped cycles in nonlinear PLL-based circuits\nextremely important for modern telecommunications. Most mathematical results in\nthis direction, available in the literature, examine the probability density of\nthe phase error and expected number of slipped cycles under stochastic noise in\nthe signal.

It is assumed that there is no direct link between the\nsource and the destination, and the buffer-aided relay forwards the information\nto the destination by employing the decode-and-forward scheme. Given\nstatistical delay constraints specified via maximum delay and delay violation\nprobability, the tradeoff between the statistical delay constraints imposed on\nany two concatenated queues is identified. With this characterization, the\nmaximum constant arrival rates that can be supported by this two-hop link are\nobtained by determining the effective capacity of such links as a function of\nthe statistical delay constraints, signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) at the source\nand relay, and the fading distributions of the links. It is shown that\nasymmetric statistical delay constraints at the buffers of the source and relay\nnode can improve the achievable rate. Overall, the impact of the statistical\ndelay tradeoff on the achievable throughput is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Nov 2014 15:45:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 07:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-24"}

This\nmodel consists of a kinetic term and interaction terms without derivative.

Although the model does not\ngenerate any ghost on the Minkowski space-time, it is not so clear whether or\nnot this property is preserved even on curved space-time. In fact, Buchbinder\net al. have found that the ghost appears even in the Fierz-Pauli theory on\ncurved space-time if we do not include non-minimal coupling terms.
