The latter emits scintillation photons with a\nwavelength of 127 nm that need to be downshifted to be detected by\nphotomultipliers with glass or quartz windows. TetraPhenyl Butadiene has been\ndemonstrated to have an extremely high conversion efficiency, possibly higher\nthan 100 % for 127 nm photons, while there is no precise information about the\ntime dependence of its emission. It is usually assumed to be exponentially\ndecaying with a characteristic time of the order of one ns, as an extrapolation\nfrom measurements with exciting radiation in the near UV. This work shows that\nTetraPhenyl Butadiene, when excited by 127 nm photons, reemits photons not only\nwith a very short decay time, but also with slower ones due to triplet states\nde-excitations. This fact can strongly contribute to clarify the anomalies in\nliquid Argon scintillation light reported in literature since seventies, namely\nthe inconsistency in the measured values of the long decay time constant and\nthe appearance of an intermediate component. Similar effects should be also\nexpected when the TPB is used in combination with Helium and Neon, that emit\nscintillation photons with wavelengths shorter than 127 nm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 16:05:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2015 18:59:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-31"}

Much of the past work considers graph\nevolution algorithms known as Achlioptas processes in which a single edge is\nadded to the graph from a set of $k$ randomly chosen candidate edges at each\ntimestep until a giant component emerges. Several Achlioptas processes seem to\nyield a discontinuous percolation transition, but it was proven by Riordan and\nWarnke that the transition must be continuous in the thermodynamic limit.\nHowever, they also proved that if the number $k(n)$ of candidate edges\nincreases with the number of nodes, then the percolation transition may be\ndiscontinuous. Here we attempt to find the simplest such process which yields a\ndiscontinuous transition in the thermodynamic limit. We introduce a process\nwhich considers only the degree of candidate edges and not component size. We\ncalculate the critical point $t_{c}=(1-\\theta(\\frac{1}{k}))n$ and rigorously\nshow that the critical window is of size $O(\\frac{n}{k(n)})$. If $k(n)$ grows\nvery slowly, for example $k(n)=\\log n$, the critical window is barely sublinear\nand hence the phase transition is discontinuous but appears continuous in\nfinite systems. We also present arguments that Achlioptas processes with\nbounded size rules will always have continuous percolation transitions even\nwith infinite choice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 16:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

They are related to the variations of transverse shear and normal\nstresses computed at specific points for a simply supported bending problem.\nReddy, Cho-Parmerter and (a modified version of) Beakou-Touratier theories have\nbeen retained for comparisons.

Yet, the intricate\nmathematical structure of the Boltzmann equation substantially limits the\nprogress toward a full understanding of this equation by solely analytical\nmeans. Here, we propose a general framework to numerically solve the Boltzmann\nequation for self-propelled particle systems in two spatial dimensions and with\narbitrary boundary conditions. We discuss potential applications of this\nnumerical framework to active matter systems, and use the algorithm to give a\ndetailed analysis to a model system of self-propelled particles with polar\ninteractions. In accordance with previous studies, we find that spatially\nhomogeneous isotropic and broken symmetry states populate two distinct regions\nin parameter space, which are separated by a narrow region of spatially\ninhomogeneous, density-segregated moving patterns. We find clear evidence that\nthese three regions in parameter space are connected by first order phase\ntransitions, and that the transition between the spatially homogeneous\nisotropic and polar ordered phases bears striking similarities to liquid-gas\nphase transitions in equilibrium systems. Within the density segregated\nparameter regime, we find a novel stable limit-cycle solution of the Boltzmann\nequation, which consists of parallel lanes of polar clusters moving in opposite\ndirections, so as to render the overall symmetry of the system's ordered state\nnematic, despite purely polar interactions on the level of single particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 16:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

We examine the\nrelation between dust and gas at 10-50 pc resolution in the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) based on Herschel far-infrared (FIR), H I 21\ncm, CO, and Halpha observations. In the diffuse atomic ISM, we derive the\ngas-to-dust ratio as the slope of the dust-gas relation and find gas-to-dust\nratios of 380+250-130 in the LMC, and 1200+1600-420 in the SMC, not including\nhelium. The atomic-to-molecular transition is located at dust surface densities\nof 0.05 Mo pc-2 in the LMC and 0.03 Mo pc-2 in the SMC, corresponding to AV ~\n0.4 and 0.2, respectively. We investigate the range of CO-to-H2 conversion\nfactor to best account for all the molecular gas in the beam of the\nobservations, and find upper limits on XCO to be 6x1020 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s in the\nLMC (Z=0.5Zo) at 15 pc resolution, and 4x 1021 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s in the SMC\n(Z=0.2Zo) at 45 pc resolution.

Coagulation of dust grains and the subsequent dust emissivity\nincrease in molecular clouds, and/or accretion of gas-phase metals onto dust\ngrains, and the subsequent dust abundance (dust-to-gas ratio) increase in\nmolecular clouds could explain the observations. In the SMC, variations in the\ndust-gas slope caused by coagulation or accretion are degenerate with the\neffects of CO-dark H2. Within the expected 5--20 times Galactic XCO range, the\ndust-gas slope can be either constant or decrease by a factor of several across\nISM phases.

However, such models are problematic\nfrom the point of view of statistical inference. The defining feature of\nchaotic and near chaotic systems is extreme sensitivity to small changes in\nsystem states and parameters, and this can interfere with inference. There are\ntwo main classes of methods for circumventing these difficulties: information\nreduction approaches, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation or Synthetic\nLikelihood and state space methods, such as Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo,\nIterated Filtering or Parameter Cascading. The purpose of this article is to\ncompare the methods, in order to reach conclusions about how to approach\ninference with such models in practice. We show that neither class of methods\nis universally superior to the other. We show that state space methods can\nsuffer multimodality problems in settings with low process noise or model\nmis-specification, leading to bias toward stable dynamics and high process\nnoise. Information reduction methods avoid this problem but, under the correct\nmodel and with sufficient process noise, state space methods lead to\nsubstantially sharper inference than information reduction methods. More\npractically, there are also differences in the tuning requirements of different\nmethods. Our overall conclusion is that model development and checking should\nprobably be performed using an information reduction method with low tuning\nrequirements, while for final inference it is likely to be better to switch to\na state space method, checking results against the information reduction\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 17:34:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 10:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-11-24"}

Two non-collisional mechanisms have\nbeen proposed for limiting differential flow between alpha particles and\nprotons: plasma instabilities and the rotational force. Both mechanisms\ndecelerate the alpha particles. In this paper, we derive an analytic expression\nfor the rate $Q_{\\mathrm{flow}}$ at which energy is released by alpha-particle\ndeceleration, accounting for azimuthal flow and conservation of total momentum.\nWe show that instabilities control the deceleration of alpha particles at $r<\nr_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, and the rotational force controls the deceleration of alpha\nparticles at $r> r_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, where $r_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\simeq 2.5\n\\,\\mathrm{AU}$ in the fast solar wind in the ecliptic plane.

In this paper we use the complete sample of supernova remnants (SNRs)\nin the MCs to calculate the lifetime and destruction efficiencies of silicate\nand carbon dust in these galaxies.

Moreover, we comment on obtaining further\nconstraints on the parameters by comparing gravitino mass ($m_{3/2}$) with the\nHubble scale ($H$), which also provides a lower bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio\n($r$), for the cases when $m_{3/2} <H$. We also illustrate the outcome of our\nbounds in some specific class of string(-inspired) models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 20:46:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 18:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-04"}

However, for region D, the observed fluxes at 1.87 and 1.90 {\\mu}m of\nthe previously proposed ionizing star are a factor of ~40 times too bright to\nbe the heating source and hence is likely just a star lying along the line of\nsight towards region D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 21:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

HCDs have advantages over CCDs\nincluding lower susceptibility to radiation damage, lower power consumption,\nand faster read-out time to avoid pile-up. They are deeply depleted and able to\ndetect x-rays down to approximately 0.1 keV. The Speedster-EXD has additional\nin-pixel features compared to previously published HCDs including: (1) an\nin-pixel comparator that enables read out of only the pixels with signal from\nan x-ray event, (2) four different gain modes to optimize either full well\ncapacity or energy resolution, (3) in-pixel CDS subtraction to reduce read\nnoise, and (4) a low-noise, high-gain CTIA amplifier to eliminate interpixel\ncapacitance crosstalk. When using the comparator feature, the user can set a\ncomparator threshold and only pixels above the threshold will be read out. This\nfeature can be run in two modes including single pixel readout in which only\npixels above the threshold are read out and 3x3 readout where a 3x3 region\ncentered on the central pixel of the x-ray event is read out. The comparator\nfeature of the Speedster-EXD increases the detector array effective frame rate\nby orders of magnitude. The new features of the Speedster-EXD hybrid CMOS x-ray\ndetector are particularly relevant to future high throughput x-ray missions\nrequiring large-format silicon imagers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 21:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Assuming spatial stationarity,\nempirical spatial correlations are calculated as the ratio of eigenvalues of\nthe smoothed covariance surface $Cov(X_i(s),X_i(t))$ and cross-covariance\nsurface $Cov(X_i(s), X_j(t))$ at locations indexed by $i$ and $j$.

In the present paper, we consider the mean-field\nlimit of that model, called the kinetic Cucker-Smale model, which is a\ntransport partial differential equation involving nonlocal terms. It is known\nthat flocking is reached asymptotically whenever the initial conditions of the\ngroup of agents are in a favorable configuration. For other initial\nconfigurations, it is natural to investigate whether flocking can be enforced\nby means of an appropriate external force, applied to an adequate time-varying\nsubdomain.\n  In this paper we prove that we can drive to flocking any group of agents\ngoverned by the kinetic Cucker-Smale model, by means of a sparse centralized\ncontrol strategy, and this, for any initial configuration of the crowd. Here,\n\"sparse control\" means that the action at each time is limited over an\narbitrary proportion of the crowd, or, as a variant, of the space of\nconfigurations; \"centralized\" means that the strategy is computed by an\nexternal agent knowing the configuration of all agents. We stress that we do\nnot only design a control function (in a sampled feedback form), but also a\ntime-varying control domain on which the action is applied. The sparsity\nconstraint reflects the fact that one cannot act on the whole crowd at every\ninstant of time.\n  Our approach is based on geometric considerations on the velocity field of\nthe kinetic Cucker-Smale PDE, and in particular on the analysis of the particle\nflow generated by this vector field. The control domain and the control\nfunctions are designed to satisfy appropriate constraints, and such that, for\nany initial configuration, the velocity part of the support of the measure\nsolution asymptotically shrinks to a singleton, which means flocking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 22:16:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

In the second part of the article I determine the tidal\nmoments by immersing the black hole in a larger post-Newtonian system that\nincludes an external distribution of matter; while the black hole's internal\ngravity is allowed to be strong, the mutual gravity between the black hole and\nthe external matter is assumed to be weak. The post-Newtonian metric that\ndescribes the entire system is valid when r > r_min, where r_min is a minimum\ndistance that must be much larger than the black hole's radius. The black-hole\nand post-Newtonian metrics provide alternative descriptions of the same\ngravitational field in an overlap r_min < r < r_max, and matching the metrics\ndetermine the tidal moments, which are expressed as post-Newtonian expansions\ncarried out through one-and-a-half post-Newtonian order. Explicit expressions\nare obtained in the specific case in which the black hole is a member of a\npost-Newtonian two-body system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 01:41:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 01:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-05"}

A generalised hyperbolic\nBayesian hierarchical model is constructed for the intensity, frequency and\nduration of daily precipitation, including the extremes. Unlike models based on\nextreme value theory, which only model maxima of finite-sized blocks or\nexceedances above a large threshold, the proposed model uses all the data\navailable efficiently, and hence not only fits the extremes but also models the\nentire rainfall distribution. It captures spatial and temporal clustering, as\nwell as spatially and temporally varying volatility and skewness. The model\nassumes that the regional precipitation is driven by a latent process\ncharacterised by geographical and climatological covariates. Effects not fully\ndescribed by the covariates are captured by spatial and temporal structure in\nthe hierarchies. Inference is provided by MCMC using a Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm and spatial interpolation method, which provide a natural approach\nfor estimating uncertainty.

We examine such singlet-extended SUSY models with a\nPeccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry that originates from an anomalous $U(1)_A$ gauge\nsymmetry. We focus on the specific scheme that the PQ symmetry is spontaneously\nbroken at an intermediate scale $v_{\\rm PQ}\\sim \\sqrt{m_{\\rm SUSY}M_{\\rm Pl}}$\nby an interplay between Planck scale suppressed operators and tachyonic soft\nscalar mass $m_{\\rm SUSY}\\sim \\sqrt{D_A}$ induced dominantly by the $U(1)_A$\n$D$-term, $D_A$. This scheme also results in spontaneous SUSY breaking in the\nPQ sector, generating the gaugino masses $M_{1/2}\\sim \\sqrt{D_A}$ when it is\ntransmitted to the MSSM sector by the conventional gauge mediation mechanism.\nAs a result, the MSSM soft parameters in this scheme are induced mostly by the\n$U(1)_A$ $D$-term and the gauge mediated SUSY breaking from the PQ sector, so\nthat the sparticle masses can be near the present experimental bounds without\ncausing the SUSY flavor problem. The scheme is severely constrained by the\ncondition that a phenomenologically viable form of the low energy operators of\nthe singlet and doublet Higgs superfields is generated by the PQ breaking\nsector in a way similar to the Kim-Nilles solution of the $\\mu$ problem, and\nthe resulting Higgs mass parameters allow the electroweak symmetry breaking\nwith small $\\tan\\beta$.

Despite this focus, known\nEGPs populate a continuum of orbital separations from canonical hot Jupiter\nvalues (0.03-0.05 AU) out to 1 AU and beyond. Unlike typical hot Jupiters,\nthese more distant EGPs will not in general be synchronously rotating. In\nanticipation of observations of this population, we here present\nthree-dimensional atmospheric circulation models exploring the dynamics that\nemerge over a broad range of rotation rates and incident stellar fluxes\nappropriate for warm and hot Jupiters. We find that the circulation resides in\none of two basic regimes. On typical hot Jupiters, the strong day-night heating\ncontrast leads to a broad, fast superrotating (eastward) equatorial jet and\nlarge day-night temperature differences. At faster rotation rates and lower\nincident fluxes, however, the day-night heating gradient becomes less\nimportant, and baroclinic instabilities emerge as a dominant player, leading to\neastward jets in the midlatitudes, minimal temperature variations in longitude,\nand, in many cases, weak winds at the equator. Our most rapidly rotating and\nleast irradiated models exhibit multiple eastward jets in each\nhemisphere--similar to the jets on Jupiter and Saturn--and illuminate the\ndynamical continuum between highly irradiated EGPs and the weakly irradiated\ngiant planets of our own Solar System. We present infrared (IR) light curves\nand spectra of these models, which show that the amplitude and offset of the IR\nphase variation, as well as the shape of the spectra, depend significantly on\nincident flux and rotation rate. This provides a way to identify the regime\ntransition in future observations and suggests that, in some cases, IR light\ncurves can provide constraints on the rotation rate of non-synchronously\nrotating planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 04:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Feb 2015 20:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-12"}

Recently metric learning methods\nshow a good capability in learning a distance metric to explore the\nrelationship between data points.

The radiation pressure force for porous\ndust aggregates is calculated using the T-Matrix Method for the Clusters of\nSpheres. First, we confirm that porous dust aggregates are forced by strong\nradiation pressure even if they grow to be larger aggregates in contrast to\nhomogeneous and spherical compact grains to which efficiency of radiation\npressure becomes lower when their sizes increase.

Both the data-aided (DA) and the\nnon-data-aided (NDA) schemes are investigated. Unlike classical techniques\nwhere the channel is assumed to be slowly time-varying and, therefore,\nconsidered as constant over the entire observation period, we address the more\nchallenging problem of instantaneous (i.e., short-term or local) SNR estimation\nover fast time-varying channels. The channel variations are tracked locally\nusing a polynomial-in-time expansion. First, we derive in closed-form\nexpressions the DA ML estimator and its bias. The latter is subsequently\nsubtracted in order to obtain a new unbiased DA estimator whose variance and\nthe corresponding Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) are also derived in closed\nform.

Therefore,\nhard detection can be easily embedded in the iteration loop in order to improve\nits performance at low to moderate SNR levels.

While reliable\nmethods have long existed to adjust parameters such that the first-order\nstatistics of network dynamics are conserved, here we show that limitations\nalready arise if also second-order statistics are to be maintained. The\ntemporal structure of pairwise averaged correlations in the activity of\nrecurrent networks is determined by the effective population-level\nconnectivity. We first show that in general the converse is also true and\nexplicitly mention degenerate cases when this one-to-one relationship does not\nhold. The one-to-one correspondence between effective connectivity and the\ntemporal structure of pairwise averaged correlations implies that network\nscalings should preserve the effective connectivity if pairwise averaged\ncorrelations are to be held constant. Changes in effective connectivity can\neven push a network from a linearly stable to an unstable, oscillatory regime\nand vice versa. On this basis, we derive conditions for the preservation of\nboth mean population-averaged activities and pairwise averaged correlations\nunder a change in numbers of neurons or synapses in the asynchronous regime\ntypical of cortical networks. We find that mean activities and correlation\nstructure can be maintained by an appropriate scaling of the synaptic weights,\nbut only over a range of numbers of synapses that is limited by the variance of\nexternal inputs to the network. Our results therefore show that the\nreducibility of asynchronous networks is fundamentally limited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 09:16:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 08:39:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2015 16:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Therefore, they can solve NP-complete\nproblems in polynomial time and, using the appropriate architecture, with\nresources that only grow polynomially with the input size. The reason for this\ncomputational power stems from properties inspired by the brain and shared by\nany universal memcomputing machine, in particular intrinsic parallelism and\ninformation overhead, namely the capability of compressing information in the\ncollective state of the memprocessor network.

We varied\nthe hydrogen column density nH and size of the absorber, as well as the initial\npolarization state of the emitting source, to cover a wide range of scenarios.\nResults: For unpolarized primary fluxes, large (about 50deg) variations of the\npolarization position angle psi are expected before and after an occultation\nevent, which is associated with very low residual polarization degrees (P lower\nthan 1 per cent). In the case of an emitting disk with intrinsic,\nposition-independent polarization, and for a given range of parameters, X-ray\neclipses significantly alter the observed polarization spectra, with most of\nthe variations seen in psi. Finally, non-uniformly polarized emitting regions\nproduce very distinctive polarization variations due to the successive covering\nand uncovering of different portions of the disk. Plotted against time,\nvariations in P and psi form detectable P~Cygni type profiles that are\ndistinctive signatures of non-axisymmetric emission. Conclusions: Polarization\nmeasurements are thus particularly adapted to distinguish between intrinsic\nintensity fluctuations and external eclipsing events, constrain the geometry of\nthe covering medium, and test the hypothesis of non-uniformly emitting disks\npredicted by general relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 11:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In it, we develop a statistical mechanical model to describe a\nclosed loop plectoneme, applicable for when the closed loop is sufficiently\nsupercoiled. The model divides the system up into end loops and a braided\nsection; the end loops are assumed to contribute little to the super-coil\nwrithe. Within the braided section, the model incorporates interactions that\ndepend on the structure of the molecule; in particular, we consider those that\ndepend on helical structure. A method for approximating the steric interactions\nis utilized that we had previously used in other publications. We go on to\nconstruct variational approximations for our closed loop plectoneme model in\ntwo cases. The first case is where helix dependent interactions are strong, and\nin the second case they are considered weak. In developing these\napproximations, we approximate the Fuller-White condition by replacing, in all\nexpressions that depend on twist, writhe with average writhe, valid when the\nbraided section is sufficiently long. How this approximation is made and the\nconditions when this approximation is valid are also discussed.

The model enables\nindividual level inference in the presence of time transience and population\nheterogeneity. This is achieved by applying Bayesian hierarchical modelling,\nwhere marked point processes are used as descriptions of the individual data,\nwith latent variables providing a means of modelling long range dependence and\ntransience over time. In addition to providing a sound probabilistic\nformulation of a rather complex data set, the proposed method is also\nsuccessful in prediction of future outcomes. Computational difficulties arising\nfrom the analytic intractability of this Bayesian model were solved by\nimplementing the method into the BUGS software and using standard computational\nfacilities.\n  We illustrate this approach by an analysis of a data set on hormone\nreplacement therapies (HRTs). The data contain, in the form of diaries on\nbleeding patterns maintained by individual patients, detailed information on\nhow they responded to different HRTs. The proposed model is able to capture the\nessential features of these treatments as well as provide realistic individual\nlevel predictions on the future bleeding patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 14:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

In particular we do not assume the global\nexistence of a default intensity and allow default at fixed or predictable\ntimes with positive probability, such as coupon payment dates.\n  In this generalized framework we study dynamic term structures prone to\ndefault risk following the forward-rate approach proposed in\nHeath-Jarrow-Morton (1992). It turns out, that previously considered models\nlead to arbitrage possibilities when default may happen at a predictable time\nwith positive probability. A suitable generalization of the forward-rate\napproach contains an additional stochastic integral with atoms at predictable\ntimes and necessary and sufficient conditions for a suitable no-arbitrage\ncondition (NAFL) are given.

We aim to qualitatively understand the\norigin of this feature by studying simple agent--based models of language\ndynamics, where each agent adopts an inflectional state for a verb and may\nchange it upon interaction with other agents. At the same time, agents are\nreplaced at some rate by new agents adopting the regular form. In models with\nonly two inflectional states (regular and irregular), we observe that either\nall verbs regularize irrespective of their frequency, or a continuous\ntransition occurs between a low frequency state where the lemma becomes fully\nregular, and a high frequency one where both forms coexist. Introducing a third\n(mixed) state, wherein agents may use either form, we find that a third,\nqualitatively different behavior may emerge, namely, a discontinuous transition\nin frequency. We introduce and solve analytically a very general class of\nthree--state models that allows us to fully understand these behaviors in a\nunified framework. Realistic sets of interaction rules, including the\nwell-known Naming Game (NG) model, result in a discontinuous transition, in\nagreement with recent empirical findings. We also point out that the\ndistinction between speaker and hearer in the interaction has no effect on the\ncollective behavior.

In this\npaper we show how these effects can be used to reliably switch perpendicularly\nmagnetized layers and to move domain walls. A drift-diffusion treatment of the\nanomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic magnetoresistance describes the spin\ncurrents that flow in directions perpendicular to the electric field. In\nsystems with two ferromagnetic layers separated by a spacer layer, an in-plane\nelectric field cause spin currents to be injected from one layer into the\nother, creating spin transfer torques. Unlike the related spin Hall effect in\nnon-magnetic materials, the anomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance allow control of the orientation of the injected spins, and\nhence torques, by changing the direction of the magnetization in the injecting\nlayer. The torques on one layer show a rich angular dependence as a function of\nthe orientation of the magnetization in the other layer. The control of the\ntorques afforded by changing the orientation of the magnetization in a fixed\nlayer makes it possible to reliably switch a perpendicularly magnetized free\nlayer. Our calculated critical current densities for a representative\nCoFe/Cu/FePt structure show that the switching can be efficient for appropriate\nmaterial choices. Similarly, control of the magnetization direction can drive\ndomain wall motion, as shown for NiFe/Cu/NiFe structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 15:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

We conduct a thorough numerical analysis\ndistinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits as well as between trapped\nand escaping orbits, considering only unbounded motion for several energy\nlevels. It is of particular interest to locate the escape basins towards the\ntwo exit channels and relate them with the corresponding escape times of the\norbits. For this purpose, we split our investigation into three cases depending\non the initial value of the $z$ coordinate which was used for launching the\nstars. The most noticeable finding is that the majority of stars initiated very\nclose to the primary $(x,y)$ plane move in chaotic orbits and they remain\ntrapped for vast time intervals, while orbits with relatively high values of\n$z_0$ on the other hand, form well-defined basins of escape. It was also\nobserved, that for energy levels close to the critical escape energy the escape\nrates of orbits are large, while for much higher values of energy most of the\norbits have low escape periods or they escape immediately to infinity.

While\nsuch coarse models are robust and allow for reliable object detection, they\ndiscard much of the information about objects' 3D shape and pose, and thus do\nnot lend themselves well to higher-level reasoning. Here, we propose to base\nscene understanding on a high-resolution object representation. An object class\n- in our case cars - is modeled as a deformable 3D wireframe, which enables\nfine-grained modeling at the level of individual vertices and faces. We augment\nthat model to explicitly include vertex-level occlusion, and embed all\ninstances in a common coordinate frame, in order to infer and exploit\nobject-object interactions. Specifically, from a single view we jointly\nestimate the shapes and poses of multiple objects in a common 3D frame. A\nground plane in that frame is estimated by consensus among different objects,\nwhich significantly stabilizes monocular 3D pose estimation. The fine-grained\nmodel, in conjunction with the explicit 3D scene model, further allows one to\ninfer part-level occlusions between the modeled objects, as well as occlusions\nby other, unmodeled scene elements. To demonstrate the benefits of such\ndetailed object class models in the context of scene understanding we\nsystematically evaluate our approach on the challenging KITTI street scene\ndataset. The experiments show that the model's ability to utilize image\nevidence at the level of individual parts improves monocular 3D pose estimation\nw.r.t. both location and (continuous) viewpoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 15:07:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-24"}
