These nodes are\ndistinct features that are not present in conventional superconductors. They\nappear as points or lines in the momentum space where the latter can have\nangular or radial geometries dictated by the dimensionality, the lattice\nstructure and the pairing interaction.\n  In this work we study the nodes in time reversal symmetry (TRS) preserving\nNCSs at the OP, the pair potential, and the energy spectrum levels. Nodes are\nexamined by using spin independent pairing interactions respecting the\nrotational $C_{\\infty v}$ symmetry in the presence of spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC). The pairing symmetries and the nodal topology are affected by the\nrelative strength of the pairing channels which is studied for the mixed\nsinglet-triplet, pure singlet, and pure triplet. Complementary to the angular\nline nodes widely present in the literature, the $C_{\\infty v}$ symmetry here\nallows radial line nodes (RLNs) due to the nonlinear momentum dependence in the\nOPs. The topology of the RLNs in the mixed case shows a distinctly different\ncharacterization than the half-spin quantum vortex at the Dirac point. We apply\nthis NCS physics to the inversion symmetry broken exciton condensates (ECs) in\ndouble quantum wells where the point and the RLNs can be found. On the other\nhand, for a pure triplet condensate, two fully gapped and topologically\ndistinct regimes exist, separated by a QSHI-like zero energy superconducting\nstate with even number of Majorana modes. We also remark on how the point and\nthe RLNs can be manipulated, enabling an external control on the\ntopology.tions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Nov 2014 16:08:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 11:02:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 15:08:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-26"}

Since these assumptions often fail in realistic scenarios,\nmany line segments are not detected or are fragmented. In more severe cases,\ni.e., many who use the Hough Transform, extraction can fail entirely. In this\npaper, we propose a method that tackles these issues. Its key aspect is the\ncombination of thresholded image derivatives obtained with filters of large and\nsmall footprints, which we denote as contextual and local edges, respectively.\nContextual edges are robust to noise and we use them to select valid local\nedges, i.e., local edges that are of the same type as contextual ones:\ndark-to-bright transition of vice-versa. If the distance between valid local\nedges does not exceed a maximum distance threshold, we enforce connectivity by\nmarking them and the pixels in between as edge points. This originates\nconnected edge maps that are robust and well localized. We use a powerful\ntwo-sample statistical test to compute contextual edges, which we introduce\nbriefly, as they are unfamiliar to the image processing community. Finally, we\npresent experiments that illustrate, with synthetic and real images, how our\nmethod is efficient in extracting complete segments of all lengths and widths\nin several situations where current methods fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Nov 2014 19:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

These two effects have different physical origins, yet they can lead to\nsimilar gap features in the electronic spectrum. Here we show how to\ndisentangle them experimentally in the iron superconductors with one Fe plane\nper unit cell. Although the splitting of the low energy doublet at the\nBrillouin zone center ($\\Gamma$-point) can be due to either the spin-orbit\ncoupling or the nematic order, or both, the degeneracy of each of the doublet\nstates at the zone corner ($M$-point) is protected by the space group symmetry\neven when spin-orbit coupling is taken into account. Therefore, any splitting\nat $M$ must be due to lowering of the crystal symmetry, such as due to the\nnematic order. We further analyze a microscopic tight-binding model with two\ndifferent contributions to the nematic order: $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ onsite energy\nanisotropy and the $d_{xy}$ hopping anisotropy. We find that a precise\ndetermination of the former, which has been widely used to characterize the\nnematic phase, requires a simultaneous measurement of the splittings of the\n$\\Gamma$-point doublet and at the two low-energy $M$-point doublets.

However,\nthe joint fluctuations relating cell size, doubling time and individual growth\nrate are only starting to be characterized. Recent studies in bacteria (i)\nrevealed the near constancy of the size extension in a single cell cycle (adder\nmechanism), and (ii) reported a universal trend where the spread in both size\nand doubling times is a linear function of the population means of these\nvariables. Here, we combine experiments and theory and use scaling concepts to\nelucidate the constraints posed by the second observation on the division\ncontrol mechanism and on the joint fluctuations of sizes and doubling times. We\nfound that scaling relations based on the means both collapse size and\ndoubling-time distributions across different conditions, and explain how the\nshape of their joint fluctuations deviates from the means. Our data on these\njoint fluctuations highlight the importance of cell individuality: single cells\ndo not follow the dependence observed for the means between size and either\ngrowth rate or inverse doubling time. Our calculations show that these results\nemerge from a broad class of division control mechanisms (including the adder\nmechanism as a particular case) requiring a certain scaling form of the\nso-called \"division hazard rate function\", which defines the probability rate\nof dividing as a function of measurable parameters. This gives a rationale for\nthe universal body-size distributions observed in microbial ecosystems across\nmany microbial species, presumably dividing with multiple mechanisms.\nAdditionally, our experiments show a crossover between fast and slow growth in\nthe relation between individual-cell growth rate and division time, which can\nbe understood in terms of different regimes of genome replication control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Nov 2014 23:09:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 10:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2015 07:03:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2015 18:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-25"}

It is\nomnipresent in psychology, economics, and even scientific practices. Prior\ntheoretical research of this phenomenon has mainly focused on its economic\nimplications possibly missing its potential connections with broader notions of\ncognitive science. Methodology/Principal Findings: We formulate a\n(non-Bayesian) model for revising subjective probabilistic opinion of a\nconfirmationally-biased agent in the light of a persuasive opinion. The\nrevision rule ensures that the agent does not react to persuasion that is\neither far from his current opinion or coincides with it. We demonstrate that\nthe model accounts for the basic phenomenology of the social judgment theory,\nand allows to study various phenomena such as cognitive dissonance and\nboomerang effect. The model also displays the order of presentation effect|when\nconsecutively exposed to two opinions, the preference is given to the last\nopinion (recency) or the first opinion (primacy)|and relates recency to\nconfirmation bias. Finally, we study the model in the case of repeated\npersuasion and analyze its convergence properties. Conclusions: The standard\nBayesian approach to probabilistic opinion revision is inadequate for\ndescribing the observed phenomenology of persuasion process. The simple\nnon-Bayesian model proposed here does agree with this phenomenology and is\ncapable of reproducing a spectrum of effects observed in psychology:\nprimacy-recency phenomenon, boomerang effect and cognitive dissonance. We point\nout several limitations of the model that should motivate its future\ndevelopment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Nov 2014 23:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

In the case of a\ncrossover phase transition, $m_D/T$ has a minimum similar to that found for the\nspeed of sound squared $c_s^2$. This holographic framework is also used to\nevaluate $m_D$ as a function of $\\eta/s$ in a strongly coupled conformal gauge\nplasma dual to Gauss-Bonnet gravity. In this case, $m_D/T$ decreases with\nincreasing $\\eta/s$ in accordance with extrapolations from weak coupling\ncalculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Nov 2014 23:40:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jan 2015 19:48:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-08"}

To achieve accurate and\nreliable estimation of the human pose, it is well-recognized that the clothing\nattributes are useful and should be utilized properly. Most previous\napproaches, however, require to manually annotate the clothing attributes and\nare therefore very costly. In this paper, we shall propose and explore a\n\\emph{latent} clothing attribute approach for HPE. Unlike previous approaches,\nour approach models the clothing attributes as latent variables and thus\nrequires no explicit labeling for the clothing attributes. The inference of the\nlatent variables are accomplished by utilizing the framework of latent\nstructured support vector machines (LSSVM). We employ the strategy of\n\\emph{alternating direction} to train the LSSVM model: In each iteration, one\nkind of variables (e.g., human pose or clothing attribute) are fixed and the\nothers are optimized.

We give a detailed description of the model, which is then applied\nto study the mechanism of short laser pulse melting of free standing Si films.\nThe effect of laser-induced pressure and temperature of the lattice on the\nmelting kinetics is investigated. Two competing melting mechanisms,\nheterogeneous and homogeneous, were identified. Apart of classical\nheterogeneous melting mechanism, the nucleation of the liquid phase\nhomogeneously inside the material significantly contributes to the melting\nprocess. The simulations showed, that due to the open diamond structure of the\ncrystal, the laser-generated internal compressive stresses reduce the crystal\nstability against the homogeneous melting. Consequently, the latter can take a\nmassive character within several picoseconds upon the laser heating. Due to\nnegative volume of melting of modeled Si material, -7.5%, the material\ncontracts upon the phase transition, relaxes the compressive stresses and the\nsubsequent melting proceeds heterogeneously until the excess of thermal energy\nis consumed. The threshold fluence value, at which homogeneous nucleation of\nliquid starts contributing to the classical heterogeneous propagation of the\nsolid-liquid interface, is found from the series of simulations at different\nlaser input fluences.

We used the Rayleigh integral to simulate the interactions\nbetween different guided modes at the aperture, with low time-consuming. This\nkind of guided-wave technique can be utilized to solve problems in diverse\nfields of wave science such as acoustics, electromagnetism and optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 05:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

This includes broadcasting of quantum entanglement as well as\ncorrelations that go beyond the notion of entanglement. It is quite well known\nfrom the \"No-Broadcasting theorem\" that perfect broadcasting of quantum\ncorrelation is not possible. However it does not rule out the possibility of\npartial broadcasting of correlations where we can get lesser correlated states\nfrom a given correlated state. In order to have a holistic view of\nbroadcasting, we investigate this problem by starting with most general\nrepresentation of two qubit mixed states in terms of the Bloch vectors. As a\ncloning transformation we have used universal symmetric optimal Buzek-Hillery\n(B-H) cloner both locally and nonlocally. More specifically, we obtain a set of\nranges in terms of Bloch vectors for which broadcasting of entanglement will be\npossible. In addition to the idea of broadcasting of entanglement for general\ntwo qubit mixed states, we explore broadcasting of quantum correlations that go\nbeyond entanglement with the help of both local and nonlocal cloners.\nRemarkably, we find that it is impossible to even partially broadcast such\ncorrelations by using both local and nonlocal quantum copying machines. Taking\ntwo different types Buzek-Hillery quantum cloners (state dependent and state\nindependent) we analytically prove the impossibility of even partial\nbroadcasting of correlation. Lastly, we generalize this impossibility result\nfor any symmetric or asymmetric cloning machines as well. This result brings\nout a fundamental difference between the correlation defined from the\nperspective of entanglement and the correlation measure which claims to go\nbeyond entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 09:25:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Apr 2015 18:24:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 06:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

Our\napproach is based on a slice decomposition of maps which relates the\ndistance-dependent two-point function to the coefficients of the continued\nfraction expansions of some distance-independent map generating functions.\nSpecial attention is paid to the case of vertex-bicolored quadrangulations and\nhexangulations, whose two-point functions are also obtained in a more direct\nway involving equivalences with hard dimer statistics. A few consequences of\nour results, as well as some extension to vertex-tricolored maps, are also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 09:56:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-02"}

But\nrich model classes may be too complex to admit estimators that converge to the\ntruth with convergence rates that can be uniformly bounded over the entire\ncollection of probability distributions comprising the model class, i.e. it may\nbe impossible to guarantee uniform consistency of such estimators as the sample\nsize increases. In such cases, it is conventional to settle for estimators with\nguarantees on convergence rate where the performance can be bounded in a\nmodel-dependent way, i.e. pointwise consistent estimators. But this viewpoint\nhas the serious drawback that estimator performance is a function of the\nunknown model within the model class that is being estimated, and is therefore\nunknown. Even if an estimator is consistent, how well it is doing at any given\ntime may not be clear, no matter what the sample size of the observations.\n  Departing from the classical uniform/pointwise consistency dichotomy that\nleads to this impasse, a new analysis framework is explored by studying rich\nmodel classes that may only admit pointwise consistency guarantees, yet all the\ninformation about the unknown model driving the observations that is needed to\ngauge estimator accuracy can be inferred from the sample at hand. We expect\nthat this data-derived estimation framework will be broadly applicable to a\nwide range of estimation problems by providing a methodology to deal with much\nricher model classes. In this paper we analyze the lossless compression problem\nin detail in this novel data-derived framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 10:02:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 22:47:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 06:46:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 May 2022 22:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-04"}

We introduce \"fracpairs\" as pairs subject\nto laws consistent with the use of the pair as a fraction, but do not exclude\ndenominators to be zero. We investigate fracpairs over a reduced commutative\nring (a commutative ring that has no nonzero nilpotent elements) and provide\nthese with natural definitions for addition, multiplication, and additive and\nmultiplicative inverse. We find that modulo a simple congruence these fracpairs\nconstitute a \"common meadow\", which is a commutative monoid both for addition\nand multiplication, extended with a weak additive inverse, a multiplicative\ninverse except for zero, and an additional element \"a\" that is the image of the\nmultiplicative inverse on zero and that propagates through all operations.\nConsidering \"a\" as an error-value supports the intuition.\n  The equivalence classes of fracpairs thus obtained are called common\ncancellation fractions (cc-fractions), and cc-fractions over the integers\nconstitute a homomorphic pre-image of the common meadow Qa, the field Q of\nrational numbers expanded with an a-totalized inverse. Moreover, the initial\ncommon meadow is isomorphic to the initial algebra of cc-fractions over the\ninteger numbers. Next, we define canonical term algebras for cc-fractions over\nthe integers and some meadows that model the rational numbers expanded with a\ntotalized inverse, and provide some negative results concerning their\nassociated term rewriting properties. Then we consider reduced commutative\nrings in which the sum of two squares plus one cannot be a zero divisor: by\nextending the equivalence relation on fracpairs we obtain an initial algebra\nthat is isomorphic to Qa.

We show that these two problems can be simultaneously solved by\nproposing a new method (called principal coefficients embedding, PCE). For a\ngiven data set $\\mathbf{D}\\in \\mathds{R}^{m\\times n}$, PCE recovers a clean\ndata set $\\mathbf{D}_{0}\\in \\mathds{R}^{m\\times n}$ from $\\mathbf{D}$ and\nsimultaneously learns a global reconstruction relation $\\mathbf{C}\\in\n\\mathbf{R}^{n\\times n}$ of $\\mathbf{D}_{0}$. By preserving $\\mathbf{C}$ into an\n$m^{\\prime}$-dimensional space, the proposed method obtains a projection matrix\nthat can capture the latent manifold structure of $\\mathbf{D}_{0}$, where\n$m^{\\prime}\\ll m$ is automatically determined by the rank of $\\mathbf{C}$ with\ntheoretical guarantees. PCE has three advantages: 1) it can automatically\ndetermine the feature dimension even though data are sampled from a union of\nmultiple linear subspaces in presence of the Gaussian noise, 2) Although the\nobjective function of PCE only considers the Gaussian noise, experimental\nresults show that it is robust to the non-Gaussian noise (\\textit{e.g.}, random\npixel corruption) and real disguises, 3) Our method has a closed-form solution\nand can be calculated very fast.

Mass,\nmetallicity, mass loss and rotation are the main drivers of stellar evolution.\nBinarity and magnetic field may also significantly affect the fate of massive\nstars. Our goal is to investigate the evolution of single O stars in the\nGalaxy. For that, we use a sample of 74 objects comprising all luminosity\nclasses and spectral types from O4 to O9.7. We rely on optical spectroscopy\nobtained in the context of the MiMeS survey of massive stars. We perform\nspectral modelling with the code CMFGEN. We determine the surface properties of\nthe sample stars, with special emphasis on abundances of carbon, nitrogen and\noxygen. Most of our sample stars have initial masses in the range 20 to 50\nMsun. We show that nitrogen is more enriched and carbon/oxygen more depleted in\nsupergiants than in dwarfs, with giants showing intermediate degrees of mixing.\nCNO abundances are observed in the range of values predicted by nucleosynthesis\nthrough the CNO cycle. More massive stars, within a given luminosity class,\nappear to be more chemically enriched than lower mass stars. We compare our\nresults with predictions of three types of evolutionary models and show that,\nfor two sets of models, 80% of our sample can be explained by stellar evolution\nincluding rotation. The effect of magnetism on surface abundances is\nunconstrained. Our study indicates that, in the 20-50 Msun mass range, the\nsurface chemical abundances of most single O stars in the Galaxy are fairly\nwell accounted for by stellar evolution of rotating stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 10:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The technique\nwas applied to ~120 supernova and ~800 spectra from the Nearby Supernova\nFactory. The ability of PCA to group together SNe Ia with similar spectral\nfeatures, already explored in previous studies, is greatly enhanced by two\nimportant modifications: (1) the initial data matrix is built using derivatives\nof spectra over the wavelength, which increases the weight of weak lines and\ndiscards extinction, and (2) we extract time evolution information through the\nuse of entire spectral sequences concatenated in each line of the input data\nmatrix. These allow us to define a stable PC parameter space which can be used\nto characterize synthetic SN Ia spectra by means of real SN features.

From the\ntheoretical point of view, these oscillations may be modeled by the process of\naccretion disk instability, driven by the dominant radiation pressure and\nenhanced heating of the plasma. Although the mean accretion rate in this source\nis probably below the Eddington limit, the oscillations will still have large\namplitudes. As the observations show, the source can exhibit strong wind\noutflow during the soft state. This wind may help to partially or even\ncompletely stabilize the heartbeat. Using our hydrodynamical code GLADIS, we\nmodeled the evolution of an accretion disk responsible for X-ray emission of\nthe source. We accounted for a variable wind outflow from the disk surface. We\nexamined the data archive from the Chandra and XMM-Newton satellites to find\nthe observed limitations on the wind physical properties, such as its velocity\nand ionization state. We also investigated the long-term evolution of this\nsource, which lasted over about 600 days of observations, using the data\ncollected by the Swift and RXTE satellites. During this long period, the\noscillations pattern and the observable wind properties changed systematically.\nWe found that this source probably exhibits observable outbursts of appropriate\ntimescales and amplitudes as a result of the disk instability.

Ingenuous localization is not possible in the presence of a\ncheating anchor node or a cheating node. Nowadays, its a challenging task to\nidentify the cheating anchor node or cheating node in a network.

The sail attitude can\nbe controlled and attitude maneuvers are possible by tether voltage modulation\nsynchronous with the sail rotation. Especially, the sail can be inclined with\nrespect to the solar wind direction to obtain transverse thrust to change the\nosculating orbit angular momentum. Such an inclination has to be maintained by\na continual control voltage modulation. Consequently, the tether voltage\navailable for the thrust is less than the maximum voltage provided by the power\nsystem. Using a spherical pendulum as a model for a single rotating tether, we\nderive analytical estimations for the control efficiency for two separate sail\ncontrol modes. One is a continuous control modulation that corresponds to\nstrictly planar tether tip motion. The other is an on-off modulation with the\ntether tip moving along a closed loop on a saddle surface. The novel on-off\nmode is introduced here to both amplify the transverse thrust and reduce the\npower consumption. During the rotation cycle, the maximum voltage is applied to\nthe tether only over two thrusting arcs when most of the transverse thrust is\nproduced. In addition to the transverse thrust, we obtain the thrusting angle\nand electric power consumption for the two control modes. It is concluded that\nwhile the thrusting angle is about half of the sail inclination for the\ncontinuous modulation it approximately equals to the inclination angle for the\non-off modulation. The efficiency of the on-off mode is emphasized when power\nconsumption is considered, and the on-off mode can be used to improve the\npropulsive acceleration through the reduced power system mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 11:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The first is to point out that the\nRestricted Isometry Property (RIP) does not hold in many applications where\ncompressed sensing is successfully used. This includes fields like Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (MRI), Computerized Tomography, Electron Microscopy, Radio\nInterferometry and Fluorescence Microscopy. We demonstrate that for natural\ncompressed sensing matrices involving a level based reconstruction basis (e.g.\nwavelets), the number of measurements required to recover all $s$-sparse\nsignals for reasonable $s$ is excessive. In particular, uniform recovery of all\n$s$-sparse signals is quite unrealistic. This realisation shows that the RIP is\ninsufficient for explaining the success of compressed sensing in various\npractical applications. The second purpose of the paper is to introduce a new\nframework based on a generalised RIP-like definition that fits the applications\nwhere compressed sensing is used. We show that the shortcomings that show that\nuniform recovery is unreasonable no longer apply if we instead ask for\nstructured recovery that is uniform only within each of the levels. To examine\nthis phenomenon, a new tool, termed the 'Restricted Isometry Property in\nLevels' is described and analysed. Furthermore, we show that with certain\nconditions on the Restricted Isometry Property in Levels, a form of uniform\nrecovery within each level is possible.

We formulate relation classification as completing the unknown\nlabels of testing items (entity pairs) in a sparse matrix that concatenates\ntraining and testing textual features with training labels. Our algorithmic\nframework is based on the assumption that the rank of item-by-feature and\nitem-by-label joint matrix is low. We apply two optimization models to recover\nthe underlying low-rank matrix leveraging the sparsity of feature-label matrix.\nThe matrix completion problem is then solved by the fixed point continuation\n(FPC) algorithm, which can find the global optimum. Experiments on two widely\nused datasets with different dimensions of textual features demonstrate that\nour low-rank matrix completion approach significantly outperforms the baseline\nand the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 12:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

It is explicitly shown that an accelerated charge,\ntaken to be a sphere of vanishingly small radius $r_{\\rm o} $, experiences at\nany time a self-force proportional to the acceleration it had at a time $r_{\\rm\no} /c$ earlier, while the rate of work done on the charge is obtained by a\nscalar product of the self-force with the instantaneous (present) value of its\nvelocity. Now if the retarded value of acceleration is expressed in terms of\nthe present values of acceleration, then we get the rate of work done according\nto the radiation reaction equation, however if we instead express the present\nvalue of velocity in terms of its time-retarded value, then we get back the\nfamiliar Larmor's radiation formula. From this simple relation between the two\nwe show that they differ because Larmor's formula, in contrast with the\nradiation reaction, is written not in terms of the real-time values of\nquantities specifying the charge motion but is instead expressed in terms of\nthe time-retarded values. Moreover, it is explicitly shown that the difference\nin the two formulas for radiative power loss exactly matches the difference in\nthe temporal rate of the change of energy in the self-fields between the\nretarded and real times. From this it becomes obvious that the ad hoc\nintroduction of an acceleration-dependent energy term, usually referred to in\nthe prevalent literature as Schott-term, in order to make the two formulas\ncomply with each other, is redundant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 12:52:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Nov 2014 12:51:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2015 14:16:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2015 03:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

The\ngeneralization lies in that the distance metric between clients and facilities\nchanges over time. This leads to a trade-off between optimizing the classic\nobjective function and the \"stability\" of the solution: there is a switching\ncost charged every time a client changes the facility to which it is connected.\nWhile the standard linear program (LP) relaxation for the classic problem\nnaturally extends to this problem, traditional LP-rounding techniques do not,\nas they are often sensitive to small changes in the metric resulting in\nfrequent switches.\n  We present a new LP-rounding algorithm for facility location problems, which\nyields the first constant approximation algorithm for the dynamic facility\nlocation problem. Our algorithm installs competing exponential clocks on the\nclients and facilities, and connect every client by the path that repeatedly\nfollows the smallest clock in the neighborhood. The use of exponential clocks\ngives rise to several properties that distinguish our approach from previous\nLP-roundings for facility location problems. In particular, we use \\emph{no\nclustering} and we allow clients to connect through paths of \\emph{arbitrary\nlengths}.

Here we propose to learn both jointly.\nSpecifically we learn the source subspace that best matches the target subspace\nwhile at the same time minimizing a regularized misclassification loss. We\nprovide an alternating optimization technique based on stochastic sub-gradient\ndescent to solve the learning problem and we demonstrate its performance on\nseveral domain adaptation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 14:29:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 15:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2015 02:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

In this paper, the ensemble property of the Fe K$\\alpha$ line in NLS1s\nis investigated by stacking the X-ray spectra of a large sample of 51 NLS1s\nobserved with {\\it XMM-Newton}. The composite X-ray spectrum reveals a\nprominent, broad emission feature over 4--7 keV, characteristic of the broad Fe\nK$\\alpha$ line. In addition, there is an indication for a possible\nsuperimposing narrow (unresolved) line, either emission or absorption,\ncorresponding to Fe XXVI or Fe XXV, respectively. The profile of the broad\nemission feature can well be fitted with relativistic broad-line models, with\nthe line energy consistent either with 6.4 keV (i.e., neutral Fe) or with 6.67\nkeV (i.e., highly ionized Fe), in the case of the narrow line being emission\nand absorption, respectively. Interestingly, there are tentative indications\nfor low or intermediate values of the average spins of the black holes\n($a<0.84$), as inferred from the profile of the composite broad line. If the\nobserved feature is indeed a broad line rather than resulting from partial\ncovering absorption, our results suggest that a relativistic Fe line may in\nfact be common in NLS1s; and there are tentative indications that black holes\nin NLS1s may not spin very fast in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 14:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

As a result, our LMA method can trade off between the size of the\nsupport set and the order of the Markov property to (a) incur lower\ncomputational cost than such sparse GP models while achieving predictive\nperformance comparable to them and (b) accurately represent features/patterns\nof any scale. Interestingly, varying the Markov order produces a spectrum of\nLMAs with PIC approximation and full-rank GP at the two extremes. An advantage\nof our LMA method is that it is amenable to parallelization on multiple\nmachines/cores, thereby gaining greater scalability. Empirical evaluation on\nthree real-world datasets in clusters of up to 32 computing nodes shows that\nour centralized and parallel LMA methods are significantly more time-efficient\nand scalable than state-of-the-art sparse and full-rank GP regression methods\nwhile achieving comparable predictive performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 15:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

As an example, the\nsemi-relativistic oscillator as a descriptive of the Landau levels for\nrelativistic electron in magnetic field is solved as an $f$-oscillator. By\nusing dispersion relation for $q$-oscillator we solve the linear\nq-Schr\\\"odinger equation and corresponding nonlinear complex q-Burgers\nequation. The same dispersion allows us to construct integrable q-NLS model as\na deformation of cubic NLS in terms of recursion operator of NLS hierarchy.\nPeculiar property of the model is to be completely integrable at any order of\nexpansion in deformation parameter around $q=1$. As another variation on the\ntheme, we consider hydrodynamic flow in bounded domain. For the flow bounded by\ntwo concentric circles we formulate the two circle theorem and construct\nsolution as the q-periodic flow by non-symmetric $q$-calculus. Then we\ngeneralize this theorem to the flow in the wedge domain bounded by two arcs.\nThis two circular-wedge theorem determines images of the flow by extension of\n$q$-calculus to two bases: the real one, corresponding to circular arcs and the\ncomplex one, with $q$ as a primitive root of unity. As an application, the\nvortex motion in annular domain as a nonlinear oscillator in the form of\nclassical and quantum f-oscillator is studied. Extending idea of q-oscillator\nto two bases with the golden ratio, we describe Fibonacci numbers as a special\ntype of $q$-numbers with matrix Binet formula.

The statistical\nmechanics of a micro-canonical ensemble of isochrone oscillators shows that the\ntemperature reaches a maximum as a function of the energy and then declines to\nzero at the escape energy. In that declining region adding heat (energy)\ndecreases the temperature, as occurs in star clusters. We then define the\ninternal temperature of an ensemble of binary stars all at the same (negative)\nenergy and show that they too get cooler when heated and hotter when cooled.\nWhen the internal temperature of a binary is less that the temperature of the\nstars it interacts with, then on average heat will flow into it, making it less\nbound and of still lower temperature. Conversely hard binaries have higher\ninternal temperatures than the local stars, so they lose energy and become\nhotter and yet more strongly bound, a process invoked by Michel Henon in his\nexplanation of star-cluster evolution. Finally we give an isochronal variation\nof Newton's exactly soluble N-body problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 15:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-19"}

Henceforth, the negative energy of binding of\npairs becomes a source of positive energy for the rest of the cluster which\nevaporate because of that. We examine under what conditions such a singularity\ncan occur, and what could happen afterwards.

The role\nthat resonant relaxation might play in globular clusters is still an open\nquestion, but the isochrone potential is guaranteed a role in dynamical\nastronomy because it is the most general potential in which closed-form\nexpressions for angle-action coordinates are available.
