To\nelucidate the structure of these connections, algorithms for tracking bundles\nof axonal fibers through the subcortical white matter rely on local estimates\nof the fiber orientation distribution function (fODF) in different parts of the\nbrain. These functions describe the relative abundance of populations of axonal\nfibers crossing each other in each location. Multiple models exist for\nestimating fODFs. The quality of the resulting estimates can be quantified by\nmeans of a suitable measure of distance on the space of fODFs. However, there\nare multiple distance metrics that can be applied for this purpose, including\nsmoothed $L_p$ distances and the Wasserstein metrics.

The system begins as a well separated\nnon-interacting binary system. Initially, the two stars evolve independently of\neach other. However, Roche lobe overflow begins as the MS star expands on its\nway to become a Red Giant. We follow the mass accreted onto the WD and the\nensuing nuclear runaways for several thousand flashes. The main finding is that\nthe Roche-Lobe mass transfer rate is modulated by oscillations in the MS star,\nwith a period that is somewhat shorter than the thermal time scale of the star.\nThis periodically modulates the rate of thermonuclear flashes on the WD,\nbetween once every 12000 yrs, such that the WD can cool, to once every 300 yrs,\nsuch that it cannot. The system is further complicated by the secular drift in\nthe secondary modulation. Such secondary modulation could explain systems like\nT Pyxidis.

The providers are incentivized by lower\nspectrum allocation fees from the regulators in return for proof-of-sharing.\nThe providers are offered discounted spectrum bands, potentially at different\nlocations, but will be asked to provide coverage to users that are not\nsubscribed to them so as to maintain their subsidy incentives from the\ngovernment. In a simplification of the model, analytical expressions for the\nproviders' perfect equilibrium strategies are derived, and we argue for the\nexistence of the government's part of a perfect equilibrium.

This enables the non-maximal\nsuppression (NMS) operation, previously treated as a separate post-processing\nstage, to be integrated into the model. This allows for discriminative training\nof our combined Convnet + DPM + NMS model in end-to-end fashion.

Thus, practical\ntechniques are based on approximations, where M provably captures the relevant\nentailments, but is not guaranteed to be minimal.

In this paper we propose a novel approach in which module\nextraction is reduced to a reasoning problem in datalog.

These configurations have a more\ngeneral character than the ones obtained with the traditional\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff, which impose the condition of local charge\nneutrality. The resulting configurations have a less massive and thinner crust,\nleading to a new mass-radius relation. Signatures of this new structure of the\nneutron star on the thermal evolution might be a potential test for this\ntheory. We compute the cooling curves by integrating numerically the energy\nbalance and transport equations in general relativity, for globally neutral\nneutron stars with crusts of different masses and sizes, according to this\ntheory for different core-crust transition interfaces. We compare and contrast\nour study with known results for local charge neutrality.

In particular, we find that the traditional increase\nof the relaxation time with the crust thickness holds only for configurations\nwhose density of the base of the crust is greater than $\\approx 5\\times\n10^{13}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The reason for this is that neutron star crusts with very\nthin or absent inner crust have some neutrino emission process blocked which\nkeep the crust hotter for longer times. Therefore, accurate observations of the\nthermal relaxation phase of neutron stars might give crucial information on the\ncore-crust transition which may aid us in probing the inner\ncomposition/structure of these objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 18:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Although\nbottom-up visual processing has been extensively studied, comparatively little\nis known about top-down signals. Here, we describe REVEAL (Representations\nEnvisioned Via Evolutionary ALgorithm), a method for visualizing an observer's\ninternal representation of a complex, real-world scene, allowing us to, for the\nfirst time, visualize the top-down information in an observer's mind. REVEAL\nrests on two innovations for solving this high dimensional problem: visual\nnoise that samples from natural image statistics, and a computer algorithm that\ncollaborates with human observers to efficiently obtain a solution. In this\nwork, we visualize observers' internal representations of a visual scene\ncategory (street) using an experiment in which the observer views the\nnaturalistic visual noise and collaborates with the algorithm to externalize\nhis internal representation. As no scene information was presented, observers\nhad to use their internal knowledge of the target, matching it with the visual\nfeatures in the noise. We matched reconstructed images with images of\nreal-world street scenes to enhance visualization. Critically, we show that the\nvisualized mental images can be used to predict rapid scene detection\nperformance, as each observer had faster and more accurate responses to\ndetecting real-world images that were the most similar to his reconstructed\nstreet templates. These results show that it is possible to visualize\npreviously unobservable mental representations of real world stimuli. More\nbroadly, REVEAL provides a general method for objectively examining the content\nof previously private, subjective mental experiences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 19:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

The core of\nsolving this inference task involves translating the logic program to a\npropositional theory and using a model counter.

Due to the difficulty of clock synchronization, many asynchronous\nprotocols based on wake-up scheduling have been developed over the years in\norder to enable timely neighbor discovery between neighboring sensors while\nsaving energy. However, existing protocols are not fine-grained enough to\nsupport all heterogeneous battery duty cycles, which can lead to a more rapid\ndeterioration of long-term battery health for those without support. Existing\nresearch can be broadly divided into two categories according to their\nneighbor-discovery techniques---the quorum based protocols and the co-primality\nbased protocols.In this paper, we propose two neighbor discovery protocols,\ncalled Hedis and Todis, that optimize the duty cycle granularity of quorum and\nco-primality based protocols respectively, by enabling the finest-grained\ncontrol of heterogeneous duty cycles. We compare the two optimal protocols via\nanalytical and simulation results, which show that although the optimal\nco-primality based protocol (Todis) is simpler in its design, the optimal\nquorum based protocol (Hedis) has a better performance since it has a lower\nrelative error rate and smaller discovery delay, while still allowing the\nsensor nodes to wake up at a more infrequent rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 01:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

When the training dataset consists of private information, it\nis natural to use a differentially private ERM algorithm, and this problem has\nbeen the subject of a long line of work started with Chaudhuri and Monteleoni\n2008. A private ERM algorithm outputs an approximate minimizer of the loss\nfunction and its error can be measured as the difference from the optimal value\nof the loss function. When the constraint set is arbitrary, the required error\nbounds are fairly well understood \\cite{BassilyST14}. In this work, we show\nthat the geometric properties of the constraint set can be used to derive\nsignificantly better results. Specifically, we show that a differentially\nprivate version of Mirror Descent leads to error bounds of the form\n$\\tilde{O}(G_{\\mathcal{C}}/n)$ for a lipschitz loss function, improving on the\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{p}/n)$ bounds in Bassily, Smith and Thakurta 2014. Here $p$ is\nthe dimensionality of the problem, $n$ is the number of data points in the\ntraining set, and $G_{\\mathcal{C}}$ denotes the Gaussian width of the\nconstraint set that we optimize over. We show similar improvements for strongly\nconvex functions, and for smooth functions. In addition, we show that when the\nloss function is Lipschitz with respect to the $\\ell_1$ norm and $\\mathcal{C}$\nis $\\ell_1$-bounded, a differentially private version of the Frank-Wolfe\nalgorithm gives error bounds of the form $\\tilde{O}(n^{-2/3})$. This captures\nthe important and common case of sparse linear regression (LASSO), when the\ndata $x_i$ satisfies $|x_i|_{\\infty} \\leq 1$ and we optimize over the $\\ell_1$\nball.

In the absence of\nstar-disk angular momentum coupling, such disk-tilting would provide a natural\nmechanism for production of primordial spin-orbit misalignments in the\nresulting planetary systems. However, owing to high accretion rates in the\nembedded phase of star formation, the inner edge of the circumstellar disk\nextends down to the stellar surface, resulting in efficient gravitational and\naccretional angular momentum transfer between the star and the disk. Here, we\ndemonstrate that the resulting gravitational coupling is sufficient to suppress\nany significant star-disk misalignment, with accretion playing a secondary\nrole. The joint tilting of the star-disk system leads to a stochastic wandering\nof star-aligned bipolar outflows. Such wandering widens the effective opening\nangle of stellar outflows, allowing for more efficient clearing of the\nremainder of the protostar's gaseous envelope.

Through off-resonant driving of a bus\nresonator, statically coupled qubits acquire a state-dependent phase. However,\nphoton loss leads to dephasing during the gate, and any residual entanglement\nbetween the resonator and qubits after the gate leads to decoherence. Here we\nconsider how to shape the drive pulse to minimize these unwanted effects.\nFirst, we review how the gate's entangling and dephasing rates depend on the\nsystem parameters and validate closed-form solutions against direct numerical\nsolution of a master equation. Next, we propose spline pulse shapes that reduce\nresidual qubit-bus entanglement, are robust to imprecise knowledge of the\nresonator shift, and can be shortened by using higher-degree polynomials.\nFinally, we present a procedure that optimizes over the subspace of pulses that\nleave the resonator unpopulated. This finds shaped drive pulses that further\nreduce the gate duration. Assuming realistic parameters, we exhibit shaped\npulses that have the potential to realize ~212 ns spline pulse gates and ~120\nns optimized gates with ~6e-4 average gate infidelity.

Compared to the parallel perceptron architecture trained by the\np-delta algorithm, which is the state of the art in terms of performance of\nreadout stages, our readout architecture and learning algorithm can attain\nbetter performance with significantly less synaptic resources making it\nattractive for VLSI implementation. Inspired by the nonlinear properties of\ndendrites in biological neurons, our readout stage incorporates neurons having\nmultiple dendrites with a lumped nonlinearity. The number of synaptic\nconnections on each branch is significantly lower than the total number of\nconnections from the liquid neurons and the learning algorithm tries to find\nthe best 'combination' of input connections on each branch to reduce the error.\nHence, the learning involves network rewiring (NRW) of the readout network\nsimilar to structural plasticity observed in its biological counterparts.

Ingenuous localization is not\npossible in the presence of a cheating anchor node or a cheating node.\nNowadays, it's a challenging task to identify the cheating anchor node or\ncheating node in a network. Even after finding out the location of the cheating\nanchor node, there is no assurance, that the identified node is legitimate or\nnot. This paper aims to localize the cheating anchor nodes using trilateration\nalgorithm and later associate it with maximum likelihood expectation technique\n(MLE), and Mahalanobis distance to obtain maximum accuracy in identifying\nmalicious or cheating anchor nodes during localization. We were able to attain\na considerable reduction in the error achieved during localization. For\nimplementation purpose we simulated our scheme using ns-3 network simulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 08:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}

A new\nmathematical entropy shows clearly the existence of two-velocity hydrodynamics\nwith a fixed mixture ratio. As an application of our result we first discuss a\nmodel of gaseous mixture extending the results of [P. Embid, Comm. Partial\nDiff. Eqs. 1987] to the global weak solutions framework. Second, we present the\nghost effect system studied by [C.D. Levermore, W. Sun, K. Trivisa, SIAM J.\nMath. Anal. 2012] and discuss a contribution of the density-dependent\nheat-conductivity coefficient to the issue of existence of weak solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 09:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 14:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-19"}

We\nintroduce a novel growth model that is motivated by time-warping models in\nfunctional data analysis and includes a nonmonotone time-warping component that\nallows the inclusion and description of boom-bust cycles and facilitates\ninsights into the dynamics of asset bubbles. The underlying idea is to model\nlongitudinal growth trajectories for house prices and other phenomena, where\ntemporal setbacks and deflation may be encountered, by decomposing such\ntrajectories into two components. A first component corresponds to underlying\nsteady growth driven by inflation that anchors the observed trajectories on a\nsimple first order linear differential equation, while a second boom-bust\ncomponent is implemented as time warping. Time warping is a commonly\nencountered phenomenon and reflects random variation along the time axis. Our\napproach to time warping is more general than previous approaches by admitting\nthe inclusion of nonmonotone warping functions. The anchoring of the\ntrajectories on an underlying linear dynamic system also makes the time-warping\ncomponent identifiable and enables straightforward estimation procedures for\nall model components. The application to the dynamics of housing prices as\nobserved for 19 metropolitan areas in the U.S. from December 1998 to July 2013\nreveals that the time setbacks corresponding to nonmonotone time warping vary\nsubstantially across markets and we find indications that they are related to\nmarket-specific growth rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 10:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-21"}

The degree is\nsensitive to the spin and the production mechanisms of the top quark. Measuring\nthe spin correlation allows to test the predictions.

A future fault-tolerant quantum computer\nwill use quantum error correction (QEC) to actively protect against both. In\nthe smallest QEC codes, the information in one logical qubit is encoded in a\ntwo-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space of multiple physical qubits.\nFor each code, a set of non-demolition multi-qubit measurements, termed\nstabilizers, can discretize and signal physical qubit errors without collapsing\nthe encoded information. Experimental demonstrations of QEC to date, using\nnuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, photons, superconducting qubits, and\nNV centers in diamond, have circumvented stabilizers at the cost of decoding at\nthe end of a QEC cycle. This decoding leaves the quantum information vulnerable\nto physical qubit errors until re-encoding, violating a basic requirement for\nfault tolerance. Using a five-qubit superconducting processor, we realize the\ntwo parity measurements comprising the stabilizers of the three-qubit\nrepetition code protecting one logical qubit from physical bit-flip errors. We\nconstruct these stabilizers as parallelized indirect measurements using\nancillary qubits, and evidence their non-demolition character by generating\nthree-qubit entanglement from superposition states. We demonstrate\nstabilizer-based quantum error detection (QED) by subjecting a logical qubit to\ncoherent and incoherent bit-flip errors on its constituent physical qubits.\nWhile increased physical qubit coherence times and shorter QED blocks are\nrequired to actively safeguard quantum information, this demonstration is a\ncritical step toward larger codes based on multiple parity measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 13:31:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-30"}

Judging by the\nprices and abundance of supply from PR firms this is an easy to implement and\nwidely used tactic, at least in Russian blogosphere. Aggregative analysis of\nsocial networks should at best mark those messages as spam or at least\ncorrectly downplay their importance as they represent opinions only of a few,\nif dedicated, users. Hence bot detection plays a crucial role in social network\nmining and analysis. In this paper we propose technique called RepRank which\ncould be viewed as Markov chain based model for reputation propagation on\ngraphs utilizing simultaneous trust and anti-trust propagation and provide\neffective numerical approach for its computation.

A prominent family of DB protocols are those\nbased on graphs, which were introduced in 2010 to resist both mafia and\ndistance frauds. The security analysis in terms of distance fraud is performed\nby considering an adversary that, given a vertex labeled graph $G = (V, E)$ and\na vertex $v \\in V$, is able to find the most frequent $n$-long sequence in $G$\nstarting from $v$ (MFS problem). However, to the best of our knowledge, it is\nstill an open question whether the distance fraud security can be computed\nconsidering the aforementioned adversarial model. Our first contribution is a\nproof that the MFS problem is NP-Hard even when the graph is constrained to\nmeet the requirements of a graph-based DB protocol. Although this result does\nnot invalidate the model, it does suggest that a \\emph{too-strong} adversary is\nperhaps being considered (i.e., in practice, graph-based DB protocols might\nresist distance fraud better than the security model suggests.) Our second\ncontribution is an algorithm addressing the distance fraud security of the\ntree-based approach due to Avoine and Tchamkerten. The novel algorithm improves\nthe computational complexity $O(2^{2^n+n})$ of the naive approach to\n$O(2^{2n}n)$ where $n$ is the number of rounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 16:06:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-19"}
