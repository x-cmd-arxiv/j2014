The second method is inspired by the image analogies approach. I\nintroduce the sparse representation model into image analogies. I first train\nrepresentative image patches (dictionaries) for pre-registered datasets from\ntwo different modalities, and then I use the sparse coding technique to\ntransfer a given image to a predicted image from one modality to another based\non the learned dictionaries. The final image registration is between the\npredicted image and the original image corresponding to the given image in the\ndifferent modality.

After recalling the basic properties of such classifying spaces, an\nimportant class of such varieties is introduced, the one of Bagnera-de Franchis\nvarieties, the quotients of an Abelian variety by the free action of a cyclic\ngroup. Moduli spaces of Abelian varieties and of algebraic curves enter into\nthe picture as examples of rational K(H,1)'s, through Teichmueller theory. The\nmain thrust of the paper is to show how in the case of K(H,1)'s the study of\nmoduli spaces and deformation classes can be achieved through by now classical\nresults concerning regularity of classifying maps. The Inoue type varieties of\nBauer and Catanese are introduced and studied as a key example, and new results\nare shown.

The disk thermodynamics and the turbulent dynamics at that\nlocation are entwined because of the importance of turbulent dissipation on\nthermal ionization and, conversely, of thermal ionisation on the turbulence.\nHowever, most previous work has neglected this dynamical coupling and have thus\nmissed a key element of the physics in this region. In this paper, we aim to\ndetermine how the the interplay between ionization and turbulence impacts on\nthe formation and evolution of vortices at the interface between the active and\nthe dead zones. Using the Godunov code RAMSES, we have performed a 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic global numerical simulation of a cylindrical model of an\nMRI--turbulent protoplanetary disk, including thermodynamical effects as well\nas a temperature-dependant resistivity. The comparison with an analogous 2D\nviscous simulation has been extensively used to help identify the relevant\nphysical processes and the disk's long-term evolution. We find that a vortex\nformed at the interface, due to Rossby wave instability, migrates inward and\npenetrates the active zone where it is destroyed by turbulent motions.\nSubsequently, a new vortex emerges a few tens of orbits later at the interface,\nand the new vortex migrates inward too. The sequence repeats itself, resulting\nin cycles of vortex formation, migration, and disruption. This behavior is\nsuccessfully reproduced using two different codes. In this paper, we\ncharacterize this vortex life cycle and discuss its implications for planet\nformation at the dead/active interface. Our simulations highlight the\nimportance of thermodynamical processes for the vortex evolution at the dead\nzone inner edge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 16:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Artificial Neural\nNetwork are a widely used class of algorithms for non-parametric system\nidentification, among them, the Nonlinear Auto Regressive eXogeneous input\nnetwork (NARX) model is very popular, but it also necessitates some in depth\nknowledge regarding the system being modeled.

Particular instances of this lemma (for\nconcrete filters) have been proven before (by Furstenberg,\nBergelson--McCutcheon, and others), with a somewhat different proof in each\ncase.

These magnitudes could trigger a phase where parity could be\nbroken in QCD. Analogies and differences with the expected behaviour in QCD are\ndiscussed besides the limitations of the model. We also consider the low energy\nrealization of QCD in terms of mesons when an axial chemical potential is\npresent. The eigenstates of strong interactions do not have a definite parity\nand interactions that would otherwise be forbidden compete with the familiar\nones. We focus on scalars and pseudoscalars that are described by a generalized\nlinear sigma model. Finally, we investigate how local parity breaking may\naffect vector physics. A modified dispersion relation is derived for the\nlightest vector mesons rho and omega. This effect predicts a natural\noverproduction of lepton pairs in the vicinity of the rho-omega resonance peak\nas well as a polarization asymmetry around this peak. The dilepton excess seems\nrelevant to explain the anomalous dielectron yield quoted by PHENIX/STAR. We\npresent a detailed analysis of the angular distribution associated to the\nlepton pairs created from these mesons searching for polarization dependencies.\nTwo angular variables are found to carry the main information related to the\nparity-breaking effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 19:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-13"}

We present a method to extract the momentum\ndistributions from experimental cross sections, which takes into account the\ntheoretical uncertainty from the various model constituents entering the\ncalculation.\n  Results: In order to test the extraction pseudo-data was generated, and the\nextracted \"experimental\" distribution, which has theoretical uncertainty from\nthe various model inputs, was compared with the theoretical distribution used\nto generate the pseudo-data.\n  Conclusions: In the examples we compared, the original distribution was\ntypically within the error band of the extracted distribution. The input wave\nfunctions do contain some outliers which are discussed in the text, but at\nleast this procedure can provide an upper bound on the deuteron momentum\ndistribution.

Furthermore, the\ngoal is rarely to find the \"true optimum\", but to identify many (if not all)\ndense substructures, understand their distribution in the graph, and ideally\ndetermine relationships among them. Current dense subgraph finding algorithms\nusually optimize some objective, and only find a few such subgraphs without\nproviding any structural relations. We define the nucleus decomposition of a\ngraph, which represents the graph as a forest of nuclei. Each nucleus is a\nsubgraph where smaller cliques are present in many larger cliques. The forest\nof nuclei is a hierarchy by containment, where the edge density increases as we\nproceed towards leaf nuclei.

With the right\nparameters, the nucleus decomposition generalizes the classic notions of\nk-cores and k-truss decompositions.

The advantages of using\na homogeneous concatenation of these datasets include meaningful measures of\nenvironment in the UDS, due to its large area (0.88 deg^2), and the high\nresolution deep imaging in CANDELS (H_160 > 26.0), affording us robust measures\nof structural parameters. We construct stellar mass functions for the entire\nsample as parameterised by the Schechter function, and find that there is a\ndecline in the values of phi and of alpha with higher redshifts, and a nearly\nconstant M* up to z~3. We divide the galaxy stellar mass function by colour,\nstructure, and environment and explore the links between environmental\nover-density, morphology, and the quenching of star formation. We find that a\ndouble Schechter function describes galaxies with high Sersic index (n>2.5),\nsimilar to galaxies which are red or passive. The low-mass end of the n>2.5\nstellar mass function is dominated by blue galaxies, whereas the high-mass end\nis dominated by red galaxies. This hints that possible links between\nmorphological evolution and star formation quenching are only present in\nhigh-mass galaxies. This is turn suggests that there are strong mass dependent\nquenching mechanisms. In addition, we find that the number density of high mass\nsystems is elevated in dense environments, suggesting that an environmental\nprocess is building up massive galaxies quicker in over densities than in lower\ndensities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 21:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Our setting\nis the category $\\mathbf{W}$ of archimedean lattice-ordered groups\n($\\ell$-groups) with designated weak order unit, with morphisms which preserve\nthe group and lattice operations and take units to units.\n  A main result is the appropriate analog of the Nakano-Stone Theorem: a\n(completely regular) locale $L$ has the feature that $\\mathcal{R}L$ is\nconditionally pointwise complete ($\\sigma $-complete), i.e., every bounded\n(countable) family from $\\mathcal{R}L$ has a pointwise supremum in\n$\\mathcal{R}L$, iff $L $ is boolean (a $P$-locale).\n  We adopt a maximally broad definition of unconditional pointwise completeness\n($\\sigma$-completeness): a divisible $\\mathbf{W}$-object $G$ is pointwise\ncomplete ($\\sigma$-complete) if it contains a pointwise supremum for every\nsubset which has a supremum in any extension. We show that the pointwise\ncomplete ($\\sigma$-complete) $\\mathbf{W}$-objects are those of the form\n$\\mathcal{R}L$ for $L$ a boolean locale ($P$-locale). Finally, we show that a\n$\\mathbf{W}$-object $G$ is pointwise $\\sigma$-complete iff it is epicomplete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 21:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-14"}

H-band methane images were collected for all three\nsources and an additional sample of 15 field T type dwarfs using LIRIS/WHT.\nJ-band spectra of resolution of ~500 were obtained for SOriJ0538-0213 with\nISAAC/VLT, and JH spectra of resolution of ~50 acquired with WFC3/HST were\nemployed for the spectroscopic classification of SOri70 and 73.

In this paper, we derive and study the\ndifferential algebraic equation (DAE) that characterizes the slow dynamics for\nsuch spot patterns for the Brusselator RD model on the surface of a sphere.\nAsymptotic and numerical solutions are presented for the system governing the\nspot strengths, and we describe the complex bifurcation structure and\ndemonstrate the occurrence of imperfection sensitivity due to higher order\neffects. Localized spot patterns can undergo a fast time instability and we\nderive the conditions for this phenomena, which depend on the spatial\nconfiguration of the spots and the parameters in the system. In the absence of\nthese instabilities, our numerical solutions of the DAE system for $N = 2$ to\n$N = 8$ spots suggest a large basin of attraction to a small set of possible\nsteady-state configurations. We discuss the connections between our results and\nthe study of point vortices on the sphere, as well as the problem of\ndetermining a set of elliptic Fekete points, which correspond to globally\nminimizing the discrete logarithmic energy for $N$ points on the sphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Nov 2014 22:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2015 14:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-22"}

The obtained experimental\ndata show prominent spin wave signal modulation (up to 20 dB for NiFe and 35 dB\nfor YIG) by the external magnetic field, where both the strength and the\ndirection of the magnetic field define the transport between the cross arms.

Focussing on the question of identifying macroscopic\nobjects, such as laboratory apparatus or even other observers, I show that the\nstandard quantum formalism of superposition is required to adequately represent\nthe classical information that an observer can obtain. I relate these results\nto supporting considerations from evolutionary biology, cognitive and\ndevelopmental psychology, and artificial intelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 00:38:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Nov 2014 02:51:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Jan 2015 23:48:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2015 14:21:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 19:51:35 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 03:46:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-11"}

The black hole corresponding to the observed off-centered\nAGN may form a binary system with a black hole located at the stellar bulge\ncenter. However, it is also possible that the displaced black hole is the\nmerged remnant of the binary system coalescence, after the \"kick\" caused by the\nasymmetric emission of gravitational waves. We propose that certain features in\nthe stellar velocity dispersion map are the result of perturbations caused by\nthe off-centered AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 04:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-14"}

While both spectra before and after the disk-disappearance\ntransition are well described by an exponentially cut-off power law, typical\nfor pulsars' emission in the Fermi's 0.2-300 GeV, a factor of 2 flux decrease\nrelated to the transition is detected.

The\ndiscovery of a Higgs boson with mass of about 125 GeV was clearly the most\nsignificant piece of news from CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In addition\nto representing the ultimate triumph of the SM, it shed new light on the\nhierarchy problem and opened up new ways of probing new physics. The various\nmeasurements performed at Run I of the LHC constrain the Higgs couplings to SM\nparticles as well as invisible and undetected decays. In this thesis, the\nimpact of the LHC Higgs results on various new physics scenarios is assessed,\ncarefully taking into account uncertainties and correlations between them.\nGeneric modifications of the Higgs coupling strengths, possibly arising from\nextended Higgs sectors or higher-dimensional operators, are considered.\nFurthermore, specific new physics models are tested. This includes, in\nparticular, the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. While a\nHiggs boson has been found, no sign of beyond the SM physics was observed at\nRun I of the LHC in spite of the large number of searches performed by the\nATLAS and CMS collaborations. The implications of the negative results obtained\nin these searches constitute another important part of this thesis. First,\nsupersymmetric models with a dark matter candidate are investigated in light of\nthe negative searches for supersymmetry at the LHC using a so-called\n\"simplified model\" approach. Second, tools using simulated events to constrain\nany new physics scenario from the LHC results are presented. Moreover, during\nthis thesis the selection criteria of several beyond the SM analyses have been\nreimplemented in the MadAnalysis 5 framework and made available in a public\ndatabase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 08:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-22"}

Our work marks a new era of optical lattices\nwhere orbital degrees of freedom play an essential role for the formation of\nexotic quantum matter, similarly as in electronic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 10:04:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2015 12:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-23"}

The key to efficiency is that we describe the equations\nof motion for the polymer in terms of the amplitudes of the polymer's\nfluctuation modes, as opposed to the use of the physical positions of the\nbeads.

It is shown that the so called anomalous luminescence of Ce-doped\nelpasolite Cs2LiLuCl6, which is characterized mainly by a very large Stokes\nshift and a very large band width, corresponds to an IVCT emission in Ce3+-Ce4+\npairs, from the 5deg orbital of Ce3+ to 4f orbitals of Ce4+. Its Stokes shift\nis the sum of the large reorganization energies of the Ce4+ and Ce3+ centers\nformed after the fixed-nuclei electron transfer and it is equal to the energy\nof the IVCT absorption commonly found in mixed-valence compounds, which is\npredicted to exist in this material and to be slightly larger than 10000 cm-1.\nThe large band width is the consequence of the large offset between the minima\nof the Ce3+-Ce4+ and Ce4+-Ce3+ pairs along the electron transfer reaction\ncoordinate. This offset is approximately 2*sqrt(3) times the difference of\nCe-Cl equilibrium distances in the Ce3+ and Ce4+ centers. It is shown that the\nenergies of the peaks and the widths of IVCT absorption and emission bands can\nbe calculated ab initio with reasonable accuracy from diabatic energy surfaces\nof the ground and excited states and that these can be obtained, in turn, from\nindependent calculations on the donor and acceptor active centers.

This makes\ndifficult to analyse dynamical properties. In particular, for logical models of\nbiological regulatory networks, it is of real interest to study attractors and\ntheir reachability from specific initial conditions, i.e. to assess the\npotential asymptotical behaviours of the system. Beyond the identification of\nthe reachable attractors, we propose to quantify this reachability.\n  Results: Relying on the structure of the state transition graph, we estimate\nthe probability of each attractor reachable from a given initial condition or\nfrom a portion of the state space. First, we present a quasi-exact solution\nwith an original algorithm called Firefront, based on the exhaustive\nexploration of the reachable state space. Then, we introduce an adapted version\nof Monte Carlo simulation algorithm, termed Avatar, better suited to larger\nmodels. Firefront and Avatar methods are validated and compared to other\nrelated approaches, using as test cases logical models of synthetic and\nbiological networks.\n  Availability: Both algorithms are implemented as Perl scripts that can be\nfreely downloaded from http://compbio.igc.gulbenkian.pt/nmd/node/59 along with\nSupplementary Material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 13:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-14"}

We assume that also neutrino masses satisfy\nm_{nu 3} > m_{nu 2} > m_{nu 1} and derive the consequences of the hierarchical\nspectra on the fermionic mixing patterns. The quark and lepton mixing matrices\nare built in a general framework with their matrix elements expressed in terms\nof the four fermion mass ratios m_u/m_c, m_c/m_t, m_d/m_s, and m_s/m_b and\nm_e/m_mu, m_mu/m_tau, m_{nu 1}/m_{nu 2}, and m_{nu 2}/m_{nu 3}, for the quark\nand lepton sector, respectively. In this framework, we show that the resulting\nmixing matrices are consistent with data for both quarks and leptons, despite\nthe large leptonic mixing angles. The minimal assumption we take is the one of\nhierarchical masses and minimal flavour symmetry breaking that strongly follows\nfrom phenomenology. No special structure of the mass matrices has to be assumed\nthat cannot be motivated by this minimal assumption. This analysis allows us to\npredict the neutrino mass spectrum and set the mass of the lightest neutrino\nwell below 0.01 eV. The method also gives the 1 sigma allowed ranges for the\nleptonic mixing matrix elements. Contrary to the common expectation, leptonic\nmixing angles are found to be determined solely by the four leptonic mass\nratios without any relation to symmetry considerations as commonly used in\nflavor model building.

The properties of\nthis interaction, which largely determine the non-thermal radiation in these\nsystems, strongly depend on the structure of the stellar wind, which can be\nclumpy or strongly anisotropic, as in Be stars. We study numerically the\ninfluence of inhomogeneities in the stellar wind on the structure of the\ntwo-wind interaction region.

For typical system parameters, and adopting a\nstellar wind inhomogeneity with a density contrast >~10, clumps with radii of a\nfew percent of the binary size can significantly perturb the two-wind\ninteraction region, pushing the two-wind interface to <~40% of the initial\ndistance to the pulsar. After it is shocked, the inhomogeneity quickly expands\nand is disrupted when it reaches the smallest distance to the pulsar. It\neventually fragments, being advected away from the binary system. The whole\ninteraction region is quite unstable, and the shocked pulsar wind can strongly\nchange under small perturbations. We confirm the sensitive nature of the\ntwo-wind interaction structure to perturbations, in particular when the stellar\nwind is inhomogeneous. For realistic over-dense regions of the stellar wind,\nthe interaction region may shrink by a factor of a few, with the shocked flow\npresenting a complex spatial and temporal pattern.

However, by increasing the size of the\nimpurity in a fixed-size host superconductor, we find a decreasing critical\ntemperature $T_c$ of the host superconductor, which agrees with the results in\ncondensed matter literatures. More importantly, the phase transition at the\ncritical impurity strength (or the critical temperature) is of zeroth order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 05:50:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 09:51:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 09:51:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 27 May 2015 02:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}

Furthermore, the lower bounds of the\ntransmission overhead for both the centralized and the distributed\narchitectures are derived. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of the resource\nallocation procedures of the aforesaid centralized and distributed\narchitectures to the changes in the number of users in the system is presented.\nBesides, a sensitivity analysis of the centralized and distributed approaches\nto the temporal changes in application usages are investigated.

In this work, the\nsynthesis of low oxygen content (< 2.5 +/-0.2 at %), few layer graphene\nnanosheets with lateral dimensions smaller than a few hundred nm was achieved\nusing a combination of ionic liquid assisted grinding of high purity graphite\ncoupled with sequential centrifugation. We show for the first time, that the\ngraphene nanosheets possessing a plethora of edges exhibited considerably\nhigher electron transfer numbers compared to the thicker graphene\nnanoplatelets. This enhanced ORR activity was accomplished by successfully\nexploiting the plethora of edges of the nanosized graphene as well as the\nefficient electron communication between the active edge sites and the\nelectrode substrate. The graphene nanosheets were characterized by an onset\npotential of -0.13 V vs. Ag/AgCl and a current density of -3.85 mA/cm2 at -1 V,\nwhich represent the best ORR performance ever achieved from an undoped carbon\nbased catalyst. This work demonstrates how low oxygen content nanosized\ngraphene synthesized by a simple route can considerably impact the ORR\ncatalytic activity and hence it is of significance in designing and optimizing\nadvanced metal-free ORR electrocatalysts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2014 10:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

In particular, we analyze\nthe biological effects of magnetic fields on soliton mediated charge transport\nin the redox processes in living organisms. Such solitons are described by\nnonlinear systems of equations and represent electrons that are self-trapped in\nalpha-helical polypeptides due to the moderately strong electron-lattice\ninteraction.
