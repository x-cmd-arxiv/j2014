This\neffect has previously been studied by Fern\\'andez & Reisenegger (2005) for\nnon-superfluid neutron stars and by Petrovich & Reisenegger (2010) for\nsuperfluid millisecond pulsars. Both studies found that pulsars reach a\nquasi-steady state in which the compression driving the matter out of beta\nequilibrium is balanced by the reactions trying to restore the equilibrium. We\nextend previous studies by considering the effect of density-dependence and\nanisotropy of the superfluid energy gaps, for the case in which the dominant\nreactions are the modified Urca processes, the protons are non-superconducting,\nand the neutron superfluidity is parametrized by models proposed in the\nliterature. By comparing our predictions with the surface temperature of the\nmillisecond pulsar PSR J0437-4715 and upper limits for twenty-one classical\npulsars, we find the millisecond pulsar can be only explained by the models\nwith the effectively largest energy gaps (type B models), the classical pulsars\nrequire with the gap models that vanish for some angle (type C) and two\ndifferent envelope compositions. Thus, no single model for neutron\nsuperfluidity can simultaneously account for the thermal emission of all\navailable observations of non-accreting neutron stars, possibly due to our\nneglect of proton superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 16:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The\nsetting allows the number of time varying regressors to be larger than the\nsample size. To make informative estimation and inference feasible, we require\nthat the overall contribution of the time varying variables after eliminating\nthe individual specific heterogeneity can be captured by a relatively small\nnumber of the available variables whose identities are unknown. This\nrestriction allows the problem of estimation to proceed as a variable selection\nproblem. Importantly, we treat the individual specific heterogeneity as fixed\neffects which allows this heterogeneity to be related to the observed time\nvarying variables in an unspecified way and allows that this heterogeneity may\nbe non-zero for all individuals. Within this framework, we provide procedures\nthat give uniformly valid inference over a fixed subset of parameters in the\ncanonical linear fixed effects model and over coefficients on a fixed vector of\nendogenous variables in panel data instrumental variables models with fixed\neffects and many instruments. An input to developing the properties of our\nproposed procedures is the use of a variant of the Lasso estimator that allows\nfor a grouped data structure where data across groups are independent and\ndependence within groups is unrestricted. We provide formal conditions within\nthis structure under which the proposed Lasso variant selects a sparse model\nwith good approximation properties.

Such effects can be observed when a glass of water is\nhandled carelessly and the fluid sloshes or even spills over the rims of the\ncontainer. However, beer does not slosh as readily as water, which suggests\nthat foam could be used to damp sloshing. In this work, we study experimentally\nthe effect on sloshing of a liquid foam placed on top of a liquid bath. We\ngenerate a monodisperse two-dimensional liquid foam in a rectangular container\nand track the motion of the foam. The influence of the foam on the sloshing\ndynamics is experimentally characterized: only a few layers of bubbles are\nsufficient to significantly damp the oscillations.

We start from\nthe generic Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) cosmology of general\nrelativity (GR) to establish a framework for the gravitational thermodynamics.\nThe Cai-Kim Clausius equation for the isochoric process of an instantaneous\napparent horizon indicates that, the Universe and its horizon entropies encode\nthe \\emph{positive heat out} thermodynamic sign convention, which encourages us\nto adjust the traditional positive-heat-in Gibbs equation into the\npositive-heat-out version $dE_m=-T_mdS_m-P_mdV$. It turns out that the standard\nand the generalized second laws (GSLs) of nondecreasing entropies are always\nrespected by the event-horizon system as long as the expanding Universe is\ndominated by nonexotic matter $-1\\leq w_m\\leq 1$, while for the\napparent-horizon simple open system the two second laws hold if $-1\\leq\nw_m<-1/3$; also, the artificial local equilibrium assumption is abandoned in\nthe GSL. All constraints regarding entropy evolution are expressed by the\nequation of state parameter, which show that from a thermodynamic perspective\nthe phantom dark energy is less favored than the cosmological constant and the\nquintessence.

In-situ\ndata from STEREO-A revealed the arrival of a fast forward shock with a speed of\nmore than 2200 km s$^{-1}$ followed by a magnetic structure moving with almost\n1900 km s$^{-1}$. We investigate the propagation behavior of the CME shock and\nmagnetic structure with the aim to reproduce the short transit time and high\nimpact speed as derived from in-situ data. We carefully measure the 3D\nkinematics of the CME using the graduated cylindrical shell model, and obtain a\nmaximum speed of 2580$\\pm$280 km s$^{-1}$ for the CME shock and of 2270$\\pm$420\nkm s$^{-1}$ for its magnetic structure. Based on the 3D kinematics, the\ndrag-based model (DBM) reproduces the observational data reasonably well. To\nsuccessfully simulate the CME shock, we find that the ambient flow speed should\nbe of average value close to the slow solar wind speed (450 km s$^{-1}$), and\nthe initial shock speed at a distance of 30 $R_{\\odot}$ should not exceed\n$\\approx$2300 km s$^{-1}$, otherwise it would arrive much too early at\nSTEREO-A. The model results indicate that an extremely low aerodynamic drag\nforce is exerted on the shock, smaller by one order of magnitude compared to\nthe average. As a consequence, the CME hardly decelerates in interplanetary\nspace and maintains its high initial speed. The low aerodynamic drag can only\nbe reproduced when reducing the density of the ambient solar wind flow, in\nwhich the massive CME propagates, to $\\rho_{\\rm sw}$=1-2 cm$^{-3}$ at the\ndistance of 1 AU. This result is consistent with the preconditioning of\ninterplanetary space owing to a previous CME.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 18:27:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

The nonlinear interaction of two traveling waves: a\nlow-amplitude 500 kHz P-wave probe and a high-amplitude 50 kHz S-wave pump has\nbeen studied on a room-dry 15 x 15x 3 cm slab of Berea sandstone.

Additional\ninformation can be gained from higher-order statistics like the bispectrum,\nespecially to break the degeneracy between the linear halo bias $b_1$ and the\namplitude of fluctuations $\\sigma_8$. We propose new simple, computationally\ninexpensive bispectrum statistics that are near optimal for the specific\napplications like bias determination. Corresponding to the Legendre\ndecomposition of nonlinear halo bias and gravitational coupling at second\norder, these statistics are given by the cross-spectra of the density with\nthree quadratic fields: the squared density, a tidal term, and a shift term.\nFor halos and galaxies the first two have associated nonlinear bias terms $b_2$\nand $b_{s^2}$, respectively, while the shift term has none in the absence of\nvelocity bias (valid in the $k \\rightarrow 0$ limit). Thus the linear bias\n$b_1$ is best determined by the shift cross-spectrum, while the squared density\nand tidal cross-spectra mostly tighten constraints on $b_2$ and $b_{s^2}$ once\n$b_1$ is known. Since the form of the cross-spectra is derived from optimal\nmaximum-likelihood estimation, they contain the full bispectrum information on\nbias parameters.

Our results point to the possibility of selectively controlling the\nwetting behavior by engineering the surface structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 20:39:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-25"}

A similar\nprocess has recently also been seen in simplified (e.g., isothermal) models of\nflux concentrations from the negative effective magnetic pressure instability.\nWe study the effects of partial ionization near the radiative surface on the\nformation of such magnetic flux concentrations. We first obtain one-dimensional\n(1D) equilibrium solutions using either a Kramers-like opacity or the ${\\rm\nH}^{-}$ opacity. The resulting atmospheres are then used as initial conditions\nin two-dimensional (2D) models where flows are driven by an imposed gradient\nforce resembling a localized negative pressure in the form of a blob. To\nisolate the effects of partial ionization and radiation, we ignore turbulence\nand convection. In 1D models, due to partial ionization, an unstable\nstratification forms always near the surface. We show that the extrema in the\nspecific entropy profiles correspond to the extrema in degree of ionization. In\nthe 2D models without partial ionization, flux concentrations form close to the\nheight where the blob is placed. In models with partial ionization, such flux\nconcentrations form at the surface much above the blob. This is due to the\ncorresponding unstable layer in specific entropy. With ${\\rm H}^{-}$ opacity,\nflux concentrations are weaker due to the stably stratified deeper parts. We\ndemonstrate that, together with density stratification, the imposed source of\nnegative pressure drives the formation of flux concentrations. We find that the\ninclusion of partial ionization affects entropy profiles causing the strong\nflux concentrations to form closer to the surface. We speculate that turbulence\nis needed to limit the strength of flux concentrations and homogenize the\nspecific entropy to a more nearly marginal stratification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 20:51:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-08"}

This attenuation introduces bias to the resulting features\nand generates ill-conditioned feature matrices. The Gaussian Pyramid has been\nused as a feature enhancing technique that encodes scale-invariant\ncharacteristics into the feature space in an attempt to deal with this\nattenuation. However, at the core of the Gaussian Pyramid is a convolutional\nsmoothing operation, which makes it incapable of generating new features at\ncoarse scales. In order to address this problem, we propose a novel feature\nenhancing technique called Multi-skIp Feature Stacking (MIFS), which stacks\nfeatures extracted using a family of differential filters parameterized with\nmultiple time skips and encodes shift-invariance into the frequency space. MIFS\ncompensates for information lost from using differential operators by\nrecapturing information at coarse scales. This recaptured information allows us\nto match actions at different speeds and ranges of motion. We prove that MIFS\nenhances the learnability of differential-based features exponentially. The\nresulting feature matrices from MIFS have much smaller conditional numbers and\nvariances than those from conventional methods. Experimental results show\nsignificantly improved performance on challenging action recognition and event\ndetection tasks. Specifically, our method exceeds the state-of-the-arts on\nHollywood2, UCF101 and UCF50 datasets and is comparable to state-of-the-arts on\nHMDB51 and Olympics Sports datasets. MIFS can also be used as a speedup\nstrategy for feature extraction with minimal or no accuracy cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 21:40:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2015 19:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2015 19:25:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 19 Apr 2015 19:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-07-14"}

To zeroth order this is a\nreasonable approximation.

Thus, it is time to abandon the\nthree pillars approach and to seek more physically-realistic interstellar dust\nanalogues. The analy- sis of the pre-solar grains extracted from meteorites,\ninterplanetary dust particles and from the Stardust mission, and the\ninterpretation of x-ray scattering and absorption observations, supports the\nview that our current view of the interstellar dust composition(s) is indeed\ntoo naive.

A way to test this hypothesis is to make a\ndirect comparison of an ensemble of solutions obtained by conventional methods\nwith an ensemble of true solutions. In order to make this possible, we wrote an\nN-body code called Brutus, that uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic. In\ncombination with the Bulirsch--Stoer method, Brutus is able to obtain converged\nsolutions, which are true up to a specified number of digits. We perform\nsimulations of democratic 3-body systems, where after a sequence of resonances\nand ejections, a final configuration is reached consisting of a permanent\nbinary and an escaping star. We do this with conventional double-precision\nmethods, and with Brutus; both have the same set of initial conditions and\ninitial realisations. The ensemble of solutions from the conventional\nsimulations is compared directly to that of the converged simulations, both as\nan ensemble and on an individual basis to determine the distribution of the\nerrors. We find that on average at least half of the conventional simulations\ndiverge from the converged solution, such that the two solutions are\nmicroscopically incomparable. For the solutions which have not diverged\nsignificantly, we observe that if the integrator has a bias in energy and\nangular momentum, this propagates to a bias in the statistical properties of\nthe binaries. In the case when the conventional solution has diverged onto an\nentirely different trajectory in phase-space, we find that the errors are\ncentred around zero and symmetric; the error due to divergence is unbiased, as\nlong as the time-step parameter, eta <= 2^(-5) and when simulations which\nviolate energy conservation by more than 10% are excluded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 22:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

The development of resistance is commonly attributed to genetic\nheterogeneity. However, heterogeneity of drug penetration of the tumor\nmicroenvironment both on the microscopic level within solid tumors as well as\non the macroscopic level across metastases may also contribute to acquired drug\nresistance. Here we use mathematical models to investigate the effect of drug\nheterogeneity on the probability of escape from treatment and time to\nresistance. Specifically we address scenarios with sufficiently efficient\ntherapies that suppress growth of all preexisting genetic variants in the\ncompartment with highest drug concentration. To study the joint effect of drug\nheterogeneity, growth rate, and evolution of resistance we analyze a multitype\nstochastic branching process describing growth of cancer cells in two\ncompartments with different drug concentration and limited migration between\ncompartments. We show that resistance is more likely to arise first in the low\ndrug compartment and from there populate the high drug compartment. Moreover,\nwe show that only below a threshold rate of cell migration does spatial\nheterogeneity accelerate resistance evolution, otherwise deterring drug\nresistance with excessively high migration rates. Our results provide new\ninsights into understanding why cancers tend to quickly become resistant, and\nthat cell migration and the presence of sanctuary sites with little drug\nexposure are essential to this end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 23:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-08-19"}

Under this\nformulation, the turbulent velocity field is expressed as a linear\nsuperposition of propagating modes, identified via a gain-based decomposition\nof the Navier-Stokes equations. Compliant surfaces, modeled as a complex\nwall-admittance linking pressure and velocity, affect the gain and structure of\nthese modes. With minimal computation, this framework accurately predicts the\nemergence of the quasi-2D propagating waves observed in recent direct numerical\nsimulations. Further, the analysis also enables the rational design of\ncompliant surfaces, with properties optimized to suppress flow structures\nenergetic in wall turbulence. It is shown that walls with unphysical negative\ndamping are required to interact favorably with modes resembling the energetic\nnear-wall cycle, which could explain why previous studies have met with limited\nsuccess. Positive-damping walls are effective for modes resembling the\nso-called very large-scale motions (VLSMs), indicating that compliant surfaces\nmay be better suited for application at higher Reynolds number. Unfortunately,\nwalls that suppress structures energetic in natural turbulence are also\npredicted to have detrimental effects elsewhere in spectral space. Consistent\nwith previous experiments and simulations, slow-moving spanwise-constant\nstructures are particularly susceptible to further amplification. Mitigating\nthese adverse effects will be central to the development of compliant coatings\nthat have a net positive influence on the flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 00:20:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Feb 2015 15:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-09"}

They are formal\ncanonical relations of a special form, constructed with the help of formal\npower expansions in cotangent directions. The result is a formal category so\nthat its composition law is also specified by a formal power series. A\nmicroformal morphism acts on functions by an operation of pullback, which is in\ngeneral a nonlinear transformation. More precisely, it is a formal mapping of\nformal manifolds of even functions (bosonic fields), which has the property\nthat its derivative for every function is a ring homomorphism. This suggests an\nabstract notion of a \"nonlinear algebra homomorphism\" and the corresponding\nextension of the classical \"algebraic-functional\" duality. There is a parallel\nfermionic version.\n  The obtained formalism provides a general construction of\n$L_{\\infty}$-morphisms for functions on homotopy Poisson ($P_{\\infty}$-) or\nhomotopy Schouten ($S_{\\infty}$-) manifolds as pullbacks by Poisson microformal\nmorphisms. We also show that the notion of the adjoint can be generalized to\nnonlinear operators as a microformal morphism.

His theory states that to erase one binary\nbit of information from a physical memory element in contact with a heat bath\nat a given temperature, at least kT ln(2) of heat must be dissipated from the\nmemory into the environment, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the\ntemperature.

The most common\ninterpretation of this phenomenon is that massive galaxies have grown in size\nby a factor of about five since redshift z=2. An alternative explanation is\nthat recently quenched massive galaxies are larger (a \"progenitor bias\"). In\nthis paper we explore the importance of progenitor bias by looking for\nsystematic differences in the stellar populations of compact early-type\ngalaxies in the DEEP2 survey as a function of size. Our analysis is based on\napplying the statistical technique of bootstrap resampling to constrain\ndifferences in the median ages of our samples and to begin to characterize the\ndistribution of stellar populations in our co-added spectra. The light-weighted\nages of compact early-type galaxies at redshifts 0.5 < z < 1.4 are compared to\nthose of a control sample of larger galaxies at similar redshifts. We find that\nmassive compact early-type galaxies selected on the basis of red color and high\nbulge-to-total ratio are younger than similarly selected larger galaxies,\nsuggesting that size growth in these objects is not driven mainly by progenitor\nbias, and that individual galaxies grow as their stellar populations age.\nHowever, compact early-type galaxies selected on the basis of image smoothness\nand high bulge-to-total ratio are older than a control sample of larger\ngalaxies. Progenitor bias will play a significant role in defining the apparent\nsize changes of early-type galaxies if they are selected on the basis of the\nsmoothness of their light distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 05:42:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2014 18:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Experiments were performed on\nEAST and J-TEXT for ohmic plasmas with net counter- and co-current toroidal\nacceleration generated by density ramping up and ramping down.

This represents a Distributed Information SHaring\n(DISH) mechanism for cooperation and suggests new ways of designing cooperative\nprotocols. However, what is lacking is a theoretical understanding of this new\nnotion of cooperation. In this paper, we view cooperation as a network resource\nand evaluate the availability of cooperation via a metric, $p_{co}$, the\nprobability of obtaining cooperation. First, we analytically evaluate $p_{co}$\nin the context of multi-channel multi-hop wireless networks. Second, we verify\nour analysis via simulations and the results show that our analysis accurately\ncharacterizes the behavior of $p_{co}$ as a function of underlying network\nparameters. This step also yields important insights into DISH with respect to\nnetwork dynamics. Third, we investigate the correlation between $p_{co}$ and\nnetwork performance in terms of collision rate, packet delay, and throughput.\nThe results indicate a near-linear relationship, which may significantly\nsimplify performance analysis for cooperative networks and suggests that\n$p_{co}$ be used as an appropriate performance indicator itself. Throughout\nthis work, we utilize, as appropriate, three different DISH contexts ---\nmodel-based DISH, ideal DISH, and real DISH --- to explore $p_{co}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 06:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-26"}

It can also be described by a purely phenomenological\nmodel such as a broken power-law or a power-law with an exponential cutoff,\nthough these descriptions lack physical motivation.

Usually, such generalization are obtained\nby introducing a \"relaxation\" variable, where the original problem corresponds\nto setting this variable to a constant value. For instance, the problem of\npacking sets of size at most $p$ into a given universe generalizes the Maximum\nMatching problem, which is recovered by taking $p=2$. Most often, the\ncomplexity of the problem increases with the relaxation variable, but very\nrecently Abasi et al. have given a surprising example of a problem ---\n$r$-Simple $k$-Path --- that can be solved by a randomized algorithm with\nrunning time $O^*(2^{O(k \\frac{\\log r}{r})})$. That is, the complexity of the\nproblem decreases with $r$. In this paper we pursue further the direction\nsketched by Abasi et al. Our main contribution is a derandomization tool that\nprovides a deterministic counterpart of the main technical result of Abasi et\nal.: the $O^*(2^{O(k \\frac{\\log r}{r})})$ algorithm for $(r,k)$-Monomial\nDetection, which is the problem of finding a monomial of total degree $k$ and\nindividual degrees at most $r$ in a polynomial given as an arithmetic circuit.\nOur technique works for a large class of circuits, and in particular it can be\nused to derandomize the result of Abasi et al. for $r$-Simple $k$-Path. On our\nway to this result we introduce the notion of representative sets for\nmultisets, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we give two more\nexamples of problems that were already studied in the literature, where the\nsame relaxation phenomenon happens. The first one is a natural relaxation of\nthe Set Packing problem, where we allow the packed sets to overlap at each\nelement at most $r$ times.

An attractive feature of such a\npossibility is that, it can reconcile dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) in\nterms of a single component, accommodated in the context of a polytropic-DM\nfluid. Accordingly, we explore the time evolution and the dynamical\ncharacteristics of a spatially-flat cosmological model, in which, in principle,\nthere is no DE at all. Instead, in this model, the DM itself possesses some\nsort of fluid-like properties, i.e., the fundamental units of the Universe\nmatter-energy content are the volume elements of a DM fluid, performing\npolytropic flows. In this case, the energy of this fluid's internal motions is\nalso taken into account as a source of the universal gravitational field. This\nform of energy can compensate for the extra energy needed to compromise spatial\nflatness, namely, to justify that, today, the total-energy density parameter is\nexactly unity. The polytropic cosmological model, depends on only one free\nparameter, the corresponding exponent, \\Gamma. What makes this model\nparticularly interesting, is that, for \\Gamma < 0.541, the (conventional)\npressure becomes negative enough, so that the Universe accelerates its\nexpansion at cosmological redshifts below a transition value. Several physical\nreasons impose further constraints on the value of \\Gamma, which, eventually,\nis settled down to the range -0.089 < \\Gamma < 0. Such a cosmological model\ndoes not suffer either from the age problem or from the coincidence problem. At\nthe same time, this model reproduces to high accuracy the distance measurements\nperformed with the aid of the supernovae Type Ia standard candles, and most\nnaturally interprets, not only when, but also, why the Universe transits from\ndeceleration to acceleration, thus arising as a mighty contestant for a DE\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 10:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-25"}

We find a\nnear-linear relationship between $p_{co}$ and the metrics, which suggests that\n$p_{co}$ can be used as an appropriate performance indicator itself.

Above a\nthreshold density the polaritons macroscopically occupy the same quantum state,\nforming a condensate.

In particular we\nexamine topics such as the difference between a polariton BEC, a polariton\nlaser, and a photon laser, as well as physical phenomena such as superfluidity,\nvortex formation, BKT (Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless) and BCS\n(Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) physics. We also discuss the physics and\napplications of engineered polariton structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 11:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Determining the location, structure, and evolution of\nwrinkles in these problems have important implications in design and is an area\nof increasing interest in the fields of physics and engineering. In this work,\nseveral numerical approaches previously proposed to model equilibrium\ndeformations in thin elastic sheets are compared. These include standard finite\nelement-based static post-buckling approaches as well as a recently proposed\nmethod based on dynamic relaxation, which are applied to the problem of an\nannular sheet with opposed tractions where wrinkling is a key feature.\nNumerical solutions are compared to analytic predictions, enabling a\nquantitative evaluation of the predictive power of the various methods. Results\nindicate that static finite element approaches are highly sensitive to initial\nimperfections, relying on \\textit{a priori} knowledge of the equilibrium\nwrinkling pattern to generate optimal results.

Furthermore, newly formed accretion disks are\nthreaded by the magnetic field dragged from the parent core during the\ngravitational collapse. These disks are expected to rotate with a sub-Keplerian\nspeed because they are partially supported by magnetic tension against the\ngravity of the central star. We discuss how sub-Keplerian rotation makes it\ndifficult to eject disk winds and accelerates the process of planet migration.\nMoreover, magnetic fields modify the Toomre criterion for gravitational\ninstability via two opposing effects: magnetic tension and pressure increase\nthe disk local stability, but sub-Keplerian rotation makes the disk more\nunstable. In general, magnetized disks are more stable than their nonmagnetic\ncounterparts; thus, they can be more massive and less prone to the formation of\ngiant planets by gravitational instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 12:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

It is trivial to construct an\nindependent set in a graph. It is easy to (greedily) construct a maximal\nindependent set. However, it is NP-hard to construct a globally-optimal\n(maximum) independent set. In general, constructing a locally-optimal structure\nis somewhat more difficult than constructing an arbitrary structure, and\nconstructing a globally-optimal structure is more difficult than constructing a\nlocally-optimal structure. The same situation arises with listing. The\ndifferences between the problems become obscured when we move from listing to\ncounting because nearly everything is #P-complete. However, we highlight an\ninteresting phenomenon that arises in approximate counting, where the situation\nis apparently reversed. Specifically, we show that counting maximal independent\nsets is complete for #P with respect to approximation-preserving reductions,\nwhereas counting all independent sets, or counting maximum independent sets is\ncomplete for an apparently smaller class, $\\mathrm{\\#RH}\\Pi_1$ which has a\nprominent role in the complexity of approximate counting. Motivated by the\ndifficulty of approximately counting maximal independent sets in bipartite\ngraphs, we also study the problem of approximately counting other\nlocally-optimal structures that arise in algorithmic applications, particularly\nproblems involving minimal separators and minimal edge separators. Minimal\nseparators have applications via fixed-parameter-tractable algorithms for\nconstructing triangulations and phylogenetic trees.

As a consequence of permanent\npolarization, the membrane capacitor is discharged at a voltage different from\nzero.

In\nthis paper, we present two contributions on time-reversal (TR) wireless\nbeamforming for single-user indoor wideband MISO systems. First, we provide\nnovel analyses of a baseband TR system using two commonly used indoor\npropagation channel models. We derive closed-form approximations for the\ninter-symbol interference (ISI) with these channel models in order to\ncharacterize the influence of propagation conditions (such as the power-delay\nprofile, delay spread, and bandwidth) on TR performance metrics. In particular,\nwe analyze spatial focusing and time compression performance of TR beamforming,\nand their impact on the bit error rate (BER). As a second contribution, we\nintroduce an equalized TR (ETR) technique that mitigates the ISI of\nconventional TR. The proposed ETR utilizes a zero-forcing pre-equalizer at the\ntransmitter in a cascade configuration with the TR pre-filter. Unlike previous\napproaches to ISI mitigation in TR systems, we derive theoretical performance\nbounds for ETR and show that it greatly enhances the BER performance of\nconventional TR with minimal impact to its beamforming capabilities. By means\nof numerical simulations, we verify our closed-form approximations and show\nthat the proposed ETR technique outperforms conventional TR with respect to the\nBER under any SNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Nov 2014 20:26:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Feb 2015 18:30:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Feb 2015 22:52:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2017 01:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

We show that in HDE cosmologies the growth factor\n$g(a)$ and the linear overdensity parameter $\\delta_{\\rm c}$ fall behind the\nvalues for a $\\Lambda$CDM universe while the virial overdensity $\\Delta_{\\rm\nvir}$ is larger in HDE models than in the $\\Lambda$CDM model. We also show that\nthe ratio between the radius of the spherical perturbations at the\nvirialization and turn-around time is smaller in HDE cosmologies than that\npredicted in a $\\Lambda$CDM universe. Hence the growth of structures starts\nearlier in HDE models than in $\\Lambda$CDM cosmologies and more concentrated\nobjects can form in this case. It has been shown that the non-vanishing surface\npressure leads to smaller virial radius and larger virial overdensity\n$\\Delta_{\\rm vir}$. We compare the predicted number of halos in HDE cosmologies\nand find out that in general this value is smaller than for $\\Lambda$CDM models\nat higher redshifts and we compare different mass function prescriptions.\nFinally, we compare the results of the HDE models with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Nov 2014 02:35:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jan 2015 19:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-27"}

Yet in many cases the connection between antibiotic\nsusceptibility and pathogen physiology remains unclear. We show that for\nribosome-targeting antibiotics acting on Escherichia coli, a complex interplay\nexists between physiology and antibiotic action; for some antibiotics within\nthis class faster growth indeed increases susceptibility, but for other\nantibiotics the opposite is true. Remarkably, these observations can be\nexplained by a simple mathematical model that combines drug transport and\nbinding with physiological constraints. Our model reveals that growth-dependent\nsusceptibility is controlled by a single parameter characterizing the\n`reversibility' of antibiotic transport and binding. This parameter provides a\nspectrum-classification of antibiotic growth-dependent efficacy that appears to\ncorrespond at its extremes to existing binary classification schemes. In these\nlimits the model predicts universal, parameter-free limiting forms for growth\ninhibition curves. The model also leads to non-trivial predictions for the drug\nsusceptibility of a translation-mutant strain of E. coli, which we verify\nexperimentally.
