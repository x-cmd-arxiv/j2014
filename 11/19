The main tool, which\ngoes back to the work of Garland, are arguments that relate the eigenvalues of\nthese matrices to those of graphs that arise as links of $(k-2)$-dimensional\nfaces. Garland's result concerns the Laplacian; we develop an analogous result\nfor the adjacency matrix.

The special case of triangle counting has received much\nattention. Getting results for 4-vertex patterns is highly challenging, and\nthere are few practical results known that can scale to massive sizes. Indeed,\neven a highly tuned enumeration code takes more than a day on a graph with\nmillions of edges. Most previous work that runs for truly massive graphs employ\nclusters and massive parallelization.\n  We provide a sampling algorithm that provably and accurately approximates the\nfrequencies of all 4-vertex pattern subgraphs.

The proposed action is invariant\nunder both diffeomorphism and conformal transformations. Using the variational\nmethod, a generalization of the Einstein equation is obtained, wherein the\nconventional tensors are replaced by their conformally invariant counterparts,\nliving in metric measure space. The invariance of the geometrical part of the\naction under a diffeomorphism leads to a generalized contracted second Bianchi\nidentity. In metric measure space, the covariant derivative is the same as it\nis in the Riemannian space. Hence, in contrast to the Weyl space, the metricity\nand integrability are maintained. However, it is worth noting that in metric\nmeasure space the divergence of a tensor is not simply the contraction of the\ncovariant derivative operator with the tensor that it acts on. Despite the fact\nthat metric measure space and integrable Weyl space, are constructed based on\ndifferent assumptions, it is shown that some relations in these spaces, such as\nthe contracted second Bianchi identity, are completely similar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 20:18:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2014 17:43:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2015 06:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-06"}

This type of problems are\nNP-hard in general, and still considered a challenge in the design of efficient\napproximation algorithms for their solutions. The purpose of this paper is to\ninvestigate the approximability for a class of such problems where the\nconstraint matrices are {\\it completely positive} and have low {\\it cp-rank}.\nIn the first part of the paper, we show that a completely positive rational\nfactorization of such matrices can be computed in polynomial time, within any\ndesired accuracy. We next consider binary quadratic programming problems of the\nfollowing form: Given matrices $Q_1,...,Q_n\\in\\mathbb{R}_+^{n\\times n}$, and a\nsystem of $m$ constrains $x^TQ_ix\\le C_i^2$ ($x^TQ_ix\\ge C_i^2$), $i=1,...,m$,\nwe seek to find a vector $x^*\\in \\{0,1\\}^n$ that maximizes (minimizes) a given\nfunction $f$. This class of problems generalizes many fundamental problems in\ndiscrete optimization such as packing and covering integer programs/knapsack\nproblems, quadratic knapsack problems, submodular maximization, etc. We\nconsider the case when $m$ and the cp-ranks of the matrices $Q_i$ are bounded\nby a constant.\n  Our approximation results for the maximization problem are as follows. For\nthe case when the objective function is nonnegative submodular, we give an\n$(1/4-\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, for any $\\epsilon>0$; when the\nfunction $f$ is linear, we present a PTAS.

This Comment shows that superconductivity occurs by\ninteractions between the chlorine layers of the TiNCl structure and the layers\ncontaining A$_x$, wherein the transverse A$_x$-Cl separation distance {\\zeta}\nis smaller than $d$. In the absence of pair-breaking interactions, the optimal\ntransition temperature is modeled by T$_{C0}$ $\\propto$\n({\\sigma}/$A$)$^{1/2}$$\\zeta$$^{-1}$, where {\\sigma}/$A$ is the fractional\ncharge per area per formula unit. Particularly noteworthy are the rather\nmarginally-metallic trends in resistivities of A$_x$(S)$_y$TiNCl, indicating\nhigh scattering rates, which are expected to partially originate from remote\nCoulomb scattering (RCS) from the A$_x$ ions. By modeling a small fraction of\nthe RCS as inducing pair-breaking, taken to cut off exponentially with {\\zeta},\nobservations of T$_C$ < T$_{C0}$ are quantitatively described for compounds\nwith {\\zeta} < 4 {\\AA}, and T$_C$ $\\approx$ T$_{C0}$ for\nNa$_{0.16}$(S)$_y$TiNCl with propylene carbonate and butylene carbonate\nco-intercalants for which {\\zeta} > 7 {\\AA}. Since a spatially separated\nalkali-ion layer is not formed in Li$_{0.13}$TiNCl, the observed T$_C$ of 5.9 K\nis attributed to an intergrowth phase related to TiN (T$_C$ = 5.6 K).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 2014 23:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

In this study, an\nalternative of non-parametric method based on Binned Kernel Density Estimation\nthat accounts measurements errors (simply called BKDE-e) is proposed. This\nmethod is applied upon proper motions data to determine cluster's membership\nkinematically and estimate the average proper motions of the cluster. Monte\nCarlo simulations show that the average proper motions determination using this\nproposed method is statistically more accurate than ordinary Kernel Density\nEstimator (KDE). By including measurement errors in the calculation, the mode\nlocation from the resulting density estimate is less sensitive to non-physical\nor stochastic fluctuation as compared to ordinary KDE that excludes measurement\nerrors. For the typical mean measurement error of 7 mas/yr, BKDE-e suppresses\nthe potential of miscalculation by a factor of two compared to KDE.

Both\nanalytic and numerical models have previously shown that Alfv\\'enic turbulence\nmay play a key role not only in the generation of the fast solar wind, but in\nthe heating of coronal loops. In an effort to bridge the gap between theory and\nobservations, we expand on a recent study [De Moortel et al., ApJL, 782:L34,\n2014] by analyzing thirty-seven clearly isolated coronal loops using data from\nthe Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) instrument.

While excesses of high frequency wave-power are\nobserved near the apex of some loops (tentatively supporting the onset of\nAlfv\\'enic turbulence), we show that this excess depends on loop length and the\nwavelength of the observed oscillations. In deriving a proportional\nrelationship between the loop length/wavelength ratio and the enhanced wave\npower at the loop apex, and from the analysis of the line-widths associated\nwith these loops, our findings are supportive of the existence of Alfv\\'enic\nturbulence in coronal loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 02:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-20"}

Here we\nattempt to model one of the key mechanisms of human intermittent control,\ncontrol activation, using as an example the task of overdamped stick balancing.\nIn so doing, we focus on the concept of noise-driven activation, a more general\nalternative to the conventional threshold-driven activation. We describe\ncontrol activation as a random walk in an energy potential, which changes in\nresponse to the state of the controlled system. By way of numerical\nsimulations, we show that the developed model captures the core properties of\nhuman control activation observed previously in the experiments on overdamped\nstick balancing. Our results demonstrate that the double-well potential model\nprovides tractable mathematical description of human control activation at\nleast in the considered task, and suggest that the adopted approach can\npotentially aid in understanding human intermittent control in more complex\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 06:39:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 14:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-27"}

This motivates a simple compression scheme: specify the sorted\npermutation of the data along with a representation of the sorted data\ncompressed recursively. The sorted permutation can be specified by recording\nthe decisions made by quicksort. If the size of the data is known, then the\nquicksort decisions describe the data at a rate that is nearly as efficient as\nthe minimal prefix-free code for the distribution, which is bounded by the\nentropy of the distribution. This is possible even though the distribution is\nunknown ahead of time. Used in this way, quicksort acts as a universal code in\nthat it is asymptotically optimal for any stationary source. The Shannon\nentropy is a lower bound when describing stochastic, independent symbols.\nHowever, it is possible to encode non-uniform, finite strings below the entropy\nof the sample distribution by also encoding symbol counts because the values in\nthe sequence are no longer independent once the counts are known.

Muon tomography essentially works like medical X-ray scan and\nintegrates density information along elongated narrow conical volumes while\ngravimetry measurements are linked to density by a 3-dimensional integral\nencompassing the whole studied domain.

As a possible explanation, the\nhydrodynamic description of the collision process was tentatively proposed.\nHowever, such effect, (albeit much weaker) also exists in the ratio of\ndata/fits, both in nuclear $Pb+Pb$ collisions, and in the elementary $p+p$ data\nin the same range of transverse momenta for which such an explanation is\ndoubtful.

In recent years, different non-parametric estimators of\nthe variation of a log-price process have appeared. These were developed by\nmany authors and were motivated by the existence of complete records of price\ndata. Among them are the realized quadratic (co-)variation which is perhaps the\nmost well known example, providing a consistent estimator of the integrated\n(co-)volatility when the logarithmic price process is continuous. Limit results\nsuch as the weak law of large numbers or the central limit theorem have been\nproved in different contexts. In this paper, we propose to study the large\ndeviation properties of realized (co-)volatility (i.e., when the number of high\nfrequency observations in a fixed time interval increases to infinity.

Further, this observation\nequally applies to other mainstream nominally-typed OO languages (such as C#,\nC++ and Scala) where generics and wildcards (or some other form of 'variance\nannotations') are standard features. Accordingly, the shape of the subtyping\nrelation in these OO languages is more complex than a tree or a simple DAG, and\nindeed is also a fractal. Given the popularity of fractals, the fractal\nobservation may help OO software developers keep a useful and intuitive mental\nimage of their software's subtyping relation, even if it is a little more\nfrightening, and more amazing one than before. With proper support from IDEs,\nthe fractal observation can help OO developers in resolving type errors they\nmay find in their code in lesser time, and with more confidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 10:20:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Dec 2014 13:17:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 06:32:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 14:39:00 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2017 17:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-01"}

HXR observations presented by using the Ramaty High-Energy Solar\nSpectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) have shown that HXR source sizes are 3-6 times\nmore extended in height than those predicted by the standard collisional thick\ntarget model (CTTM). Several possible explanations have been put forward\nincluding the multi-threaded nature of flare loops, pitch-angle scattering, and\nmagnetic mirroring. However, the nonuniform ionisation (NUI) structure along\nthe path of the electron beam has not been fully explored as a solution to this\nproblem. Ionised plasma is known to be less effective at producing nonthermal\nbremsstrahlung HXRs when compared to neutral plasma. If the peak HXR emission\nwas produced in a locally ionised region within the chromosphere, the intensity\nof emission will be preferentially reduced around this peak, resulting in a\nmore extended source. Due to this effect, along with the associated density\nenhancement in the upper chromosphere, injection of a beam of electrons into a\npartially ionised plasma should result in a HXR source which is substantially\nmore vertically extended relative to that for a neutral target. Here we present\nthe results of a modification to the CTTM which takes into account both a\nlocalised form of chromospheric NUI and an increased target density. We find 50\nkeV HXR source widths, with and without the inclusion of a locally ionised\nregion, of ~3 Mm and ~0.7 Mm, respectively.

Noise Targeting a\nfraction of nodes preserves the transitions but introduces shattered\nfragmentation with its characteristic fraction of isolated nodes and one or two\ngiant components. Both the lack of absorbing state for homogenous noise and the\nshift in the absorbing transition to higher rewiring for targeted noise are\nsupported by analytical approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 11:12:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2015 22:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-09-14"}

The standard NWA,\nhowever, does not account for interference terms. Therefore, we introduce a\ngeneralisation of the NWA (gNWA) which allows for a consistent treatment of\ninterference effects between nearly mass-degenerate particles. Furthermore, we\napply the gNWA at the tree and 1-loop level to an example process where the\nneutral Higgs bosons $h$ and $H$ are produced in the decay of a heavy\nneutralino and subsequently decay into a fermion pair. The $h-H$ propagator\nmixing is found to agree well with the approximation of Breit-Wigner\npropagators times finite wave-function normalisation factors, both leading to a\nsignificant interference contribution. The factorisation of the interference\nterm based on on-shell matrix elements reproduces the full interference result\nwithin a precision of better than 1% for the considered process.

Typically materials have an incremental\nstiffness that is fixed and positive, but recent technologies, such as\nsuper-lenses, low frequency band gap materials and acoustic cloaks, are based\non materials with zero, negative or extremely high incremental stiffness. So\nfar, demonstrations of this behavior have been limited either to a narrow range\nof frequencies, temperatures, stiffness or to specific deformations. Here we\ndemonstrate a mechanism to tune the static incremental stiffness that overcomes\nthose limitations. This tunability is achieved by driving a nonlinear defect\nmode in a lattice. As in thermal expansion, the defect's vibration amplitude\naffects the force at the boundary, hence the lattice's stiffness. By using the\nhigh sensitivities of nonlinear systems near bifurcation points, we tune the\nmagnitude of the incremental stiffness over a wide range: from positive, to\nzero, to arbitrarily negative values.

The main problem is that on an infinite dimensional group there is no\nanalogue of the Lebesgue measure, in a strict sense. There are however some\nanalogues, quite natural and easy to define: the Malliavin-Shavgulidze measures\nprovide an example and constitute the main character of this text. The first\nresults show that there is no actual disagreement of general features of the\ndynamics in the topological and probabilistic frames: it is the realm of\nhyperbolicity! The most interesting questions remain however unanswered... This\nwork, coming out from the author's Ph.D. thesis, constitutes an opportunity to\nreview interesting results in mathematical topics that could interact more\noften: stochastic processes and one-dimensional dynamics. After an introductory\noverview, the following three chapters are a pedagogical summary of classical\nresults about measure theory on topological groups, Brownian Motion, theory of\ncircle diffeomorphisms. Then we present the construction of the\nMalliavin-Shavgulidze measures on the space of interval and circle $C^1$\ndiffeomorphisms, and discuss their key property of quasi-invariance. The last\nchapter is devoted to the study of dynamical features of a random\nMalliavin-Shavgulidze diffeomorphism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 15:54:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 14:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-12-01"}

SySt-2 is only possibly a SySt because the Ne VII Raman\nscattered line at 4881 A, recently identified in a well studied Galactic\nsymbiotic as another very conspicuous property of symbiotic, could as well be\nidentified as N III or [Fe III]. Finally, SySt-3 is likely a symbiotic binary\nbecause in the red part of the spectrum it shows the continuum of a late giant,\nand forbidden lines of moderate- to high-ionization, like [Fe v] 4180 A.

It is a very hard task, however, which is\ncomplicated by the presence of circumstellar matter in these systems. So far,\nonly a small number of systems with accurate values of component masses, radii,\nand other properties are known. Here, we report the first detailed study of a\nnew representative of this class of binaries, BR CMi, based on the analysis of\nradial velocities and multichannel photometry from several observatories, and\ncompare its physical properties with those for other well-studied systems. BR\nCMi is an ellipsoidal variable seen under an intermediate orbital inclination\nof ~51 degrees, and it has an orbital period of 12.919059(15) d and a circular\norbit. We used the disentangled component spectra to estimate the effective\ntemperatures 9500(200) K and 4655(50) K by comparing them with model spectra.\nThey correspond to spectral types B9.5e and G8III. We also used the\ndisentangled spectra of both binary components as templates for the 2-D\ncross-correlation to obtain accurate RVs and a reliable orbital solution. Some\nevidence of a secular period increase at a rate of 1.1+/-0.5 s per year was\nfound. This, together with a very low mass ratio of 0.06 and a normal mass and\nradius of the mass gaining component, indicates that BR CMi is in a slow phase\nof the mass exchange after the mass-ratio reversal. It thus belongs to a still\npoorly populated subgroup of Be stars for which the origin of Balmer emission\nlines is safely explained as a consequence of mass transfer between the binary\ncomponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 06:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-14"}

That is, they consist of two node types, with each edge\nconnecting a node of one type with a node of the other type.
