However, due to the multivalent nature of vanadium and\nthe lack of a good understanding on growth control of the oxidation state,\nstabilization of phase pure vanadium oxides with a single oxidation state is\nextremely challenging. Here, we systematically varied the growth conditions to\nclearly map out the growth window for preparing phase pure epitaxial vanadium\noxides by pulsed laser deposition for providing a guideline to grow high\nquality thin films with well-defined oxidation states of V2(+3)O3, V(+4)O2, and\nV2(+5)O5. A well pronounced MIT was only observed in VO2 films grown in a very\nnarrow range of oxygen partial pressure P(O2). The films grown either in lower\n(< 10 mTorr) or higher P(O2) (> 25 mTorr) result in V2O3 and V2O5 phases,\nrespectively, thereby suppressing the MIT for both cases. We have also found\nthat the resistivity ratio before and after the MIT of VO2 thin films can be\nfurther enhanced by one order of magnitude when the films are further oxidized\nby post-annealing at a well-controlled oxidizing ambient. This result indicates\nthat stabilizing vanadium into a single valence state has to compromise with\ninsufficient oxidation of an as grown thin film and, thereby, a subsequent\noxidation is required for an improved MIT behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 16:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

Each synthesized channel corresponds to a particular\ninput to the encoder. For large $n$, the synthesized channels become either\nessentially noiseless or almost perfectly noisy, but in total carry as much\ninformation as the original $n$ channels. Capacity can therefore be achieved by\ntransmitting messages over the essentially noiseless synthesized channels.\nUnfortunately, the set of inputs corresponding to reliable synthesized channels\nis poorly understood, in particular how the set depends on the underlying\nphysical channel. In this work, we present two analytic conditions sufficient\nto determine if the reliable inputs corresponding to different discrete\nmemoryless channels are aligned or not, i.e. if one set is contained in the\nother.

Each core has been evolved\nonce with no radiative feedback from stars, once with continuous radiative\nfeedback, and once with episodic radiative feedback.

With episodic radiative\nfeedback, (i) the multiplicity frequency is ~60% higher than in the field; (ii)\nthe multiplicity frequency and the mean semi-major axis both increase with\nprimary mass; (iii) one third of multiple systems are hierarchical systems with\nmore than two components; (iv) in these hierarchical systems the inner pairings\ntypically have separations of a few au and mass ratios concentrated towards\nunity, whereas the outer pairings have separations of order 100 au and a\nflatter distribution of mass ratios. The binary statistics are compatible with\nobservations of young embedded populations, and -- if wider orbits are\ndisrupted preferentially by external perturbations -- with observations of\nmature field populations. With no radiative feedback, the results are similar\nto those from simulations with episodic feedback. With continuous radiative\nfeedback, brown dwarfs are under-produced, the number of multiple systems is\ntoo low, and the statistical properties of multiple systems are at variance\nwith observation.

In particular, the high\nfrequency peaks which are often attributed to combination frequencies can also\nbe caused by the modulation of the m=2 mode frequency in the merger phase. As a\nconsequence for GW data analysis, the offset of the high frequency peak does\nnot necessarily carry information about the radial oscillation frequency.\nFurther, the low frequency peak in our simulations is dominated by the\ncontribution of the plunge and the first 1-2 bounces. The amplitude of the\nradial oscillations depends on the initial NS spin, which therefore has a\ncomplicated influence on the spectrum. Another important result is that HMNSs\ncan consist of a slowly rotating core with an extended, massive envelope\nrotating close to Keplerian velocity, contrary to the common notion that a\nrapidly rotating core is necessary to prevent a prompt collapse.

In this paper, we establish a theoretical\nguarantee for the factorization formulation to correctly recover the underlying\nlow-rank matrix. In particular, we show that under similar conditions to those\nin previous works, many standard optimization algorithms converge to the global\noptima of a factorization formulation, and recover the true low-rank matrix.

More recently, it has been demonstrated that a tight constraint on an\nindividual planet's eccentricity can sometimes be derived from the light curve\nvia the \"photoeccentric effect,\" the effect of a planet's eccentricity on the\nshape and duration of its light curve. This has only been studied for large\nplanets and high signal-to-noise scenarios, raising the question of how well it\ncan be measured for smaller planets or low signal-to-noise cases. We explore\nthe limits of the photoeccentric effect over a wide range of planet parameters.\nThe method hinges upon measuring $g$ directly from the light curve, where $g$\nis the ratio of the planet's speed (projected on the plane of the sky) during\ntransit to the speed expected for a circular orbit. We find that when the\nsignal-to-noise in the measurement of $g$ is $< 10$, the ability to measure\neccentricity with the photoeccentric effect decreases. We develop a \"rule of\nthumb\" that for per-point relative photometric uncertainties $\\sigma = \\{\n10^{-3}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-5} \\}$, the critical values of planet-star radius ratio\nare $R_p / R_\\star \\approx \\{ 0.1, 0.05, 0.03 \\}$ for Kepler-like 30-minute\nintegration times.

Such systems may be constructed, for example, by coupling a\ngapped two dimensional state of matter that carries edge states to a gapless\ntwo dimensional system in which the spectrum is composed of a number of Dirac\ncones. We find that in the absence of disorder the edge states could be\nprotected even when the two systems are coupled, due to momentum and energy\nconservation. We distinguish between weak and strong edge states by the level\nof their mixing with the bulk. In the presence of disorder, the edge states may\nbe stabilized when the bulk is localized or destabilized when the bulk is\nmetallic. We analyze the conditions under which these two cases occur.

The core is due to primary protons which suffer\nmultiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) and slow down by multiple collisions with\natomic electrons (Bethe-Bloch theory). The halo is due to charged secondaries,\nmany of them protons, from elastic interactions with H, elastic and inelastic\ninteractions with O, and nonelastic interactions with O. We show that the halo\nradius is roughly one third of the beam range. The aura is due to neutral\nsecondaries (neutrons and gamma rays). Spray denotes dose, avoidable in\nprinciple, coming in from the beam line.\n  We have measured the absolute dose at 177 MeV using a test beam in a water\ntank. The beam monitor was a PPIC 'proton counter' and the field IC a dose\ncalibrated Exradin T1. We took depth-dose scans at ten displacements from the\nbeam axis ranging from 0 to 10 cm.

We argue that its use of T(w), a mass stopping power which includes\nenergy deposited by nuclear secondaries, is incorrect. The electromagnetic\n(Bethe-Bloch) mass stopping power should be used instead. In consequence,\n'Bragg peak chamber' measurements and associated corrections are, in our view,\nirrelevant. Furthermore, using T(w) leads to spurious excess dose on the axis\nof the core around midrange, which may be significant in fields involving\nrelatively few pencil beams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Nov 2014 22:35:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 16:17:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 May 2015 16:37:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-01"}

However, they mainly\ncapture middle-level representations, such as pose of pedestrian, but confuse\npositive with hard negative samples, which have large ambiguity, e.g. the shape\nand appearance of `tree trunk' or `wire pole' are similar to pedestrian in\ncertain viewpoint. This ambiguity can be distinguished by high-level\nrepresentation. To this end, this work jointly optimizes pedestrian detection\nwith semantic tasks, including pedestrian attributes (e.g. `carrying backpack')\nand scene attributes (e.g. `road', `tree', and `horizontal'). Rather than\nexpensively annotating scene attributes, we transfer attributes information\nfrom existing scene segmentation datasets to the pedestrian dataset, by\nproposing a novel deep model to learn high-level features from multiple tasks\nand multiple data sources. Since distinct tasks have distinct convergence rates\nand data from different datasets have different distributions, a multi-task\nobjective function is carefully designed to coordinate tasks and reduce\ndiscrepancies among datasets.

Raman active, zero-momentum inter Landau level excitations\nin graphene are sensitive to electron-electron interactions due to the\nnon-applicability of the Kohn theorem in this system, with a clearly\nnon-parabolic dispersion relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Nov 2014 15:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-01"}

Using the relations, we establish a few\nparametrization-independent equations, by which the matrix elements of the CKM\nmatrix can be completely fixed up to a universal parameter. If it is true, we\nexpect that there should exist a hidden symmetry in the nature which determines\nthe relations. Moreover, it requires a universal parameter, naturally it would\nbe the famous Jarlskog invariant which is also parametrization independent.\nThus the four parameters (three mixing angles and one CP phase) of the CKM\nmatrix are not free, but determined by the symmetry and the universal\nparameter. As we generalize the rules to the PMNS matrix for neutrino mixing,\nthe CP phase of the lepton sector is predicted to be within a range of $0\\sim\n59^\\circ$ centered at $39^\\circ$ (in the P$_a$ parametrization) which will be\ntested in the future experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Nov 2014 15:19:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2015 12:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-12-09"}
