Under the assumptions of (i)\npositive definiteness of the Hessian of the objective projected on the null\nspace of equality constraints (reduced Hessian), and (ii) linear independence\nconstraint qualification holding at the optimal solution, we derive an upper\nbound on the rate of convergence to the solution at each iteration.

In this paper, we explore the extremality of individual\nand common apparent horizons for merging, rapidly spinning binary black holes.\nWe consider simulations of merging black holes with equal masses $M$ and\ninitial spin angular momenta aligned with the orbital angular momentum,\nincluding new simulations with spin magnitudes up to $S/M^2 = 0.994$. We\nmeasure the area and (using approximate Killing vectors) the spin on the\nindividual and common apparent horizons, finding that the inequality $8\\pi S <\nA$ is satisfied in all cases but is very close to equality on the common\napparent horizon at the instant it first appears. We also introduce a\ngauge-invariant lower bound on the extremality by computing the smallest value\nthat Booth and Fairhurst's extremality parameter can take for any scaling.\nUsing this lower bound, we conclude that the common horizons are at least\nmoderately close to extremal just after they appear.

Ballooning is a part of memory reclamation technique operations used by\na hypervisor to allow the physical host system to retrieve unused memory from\ncertain guest virtual machines (VMs) and share it with others. Memory\nballooning allows the total amount ofRAM required by guest VMs to exceed the\namount ofphysical RAM available on the host. Memory overcommitment enables a\nhigher consolidation ratio in a hypervisor. Using memory overcommitment, users\ncan consolidate VMs on a physical machine such that physical resources are\nutilized in an optimal manner while delivering good performance. Hence memory\nreclamation is an integral component ofmemory overcommitment. In this paper, we\naddress that the basic cause of memory that ballooning is memory overcommitment\nfrom using memory-intensive virtual machines.

A transition in the number of\nparticipants or cells is identified by means of a measure and the corresponding\nphenomenon is further analyzed by a generalization of Wigner functions to\ndiscrete variables and crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2014 20:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-27"}

In this paper we consider an alternative view of\nparallelism in the form of an ultra-wide word processor. We introduce the\nUltra-Wide Word architecture and model, an extension of the word-RAM model that\nallows for constant time operations on thousands of bits in parallel. Word\nparallelism as exploited by the word-RAM model does not suffer from the more\ndifficult aspects of parallel programming, namely synchronization and\nconcurrency. For the standard word-RAM algorithms, the speedups obtained are\nmoderate, as they are limited by the word size. We argue that a large class of\nword-RAM algorithms can be implemented in the Ultra-Wide Word model, obtaining\nspeedups comparable to multi-threaded computations while keeping the simplicity\nof programming of the sequential RAM model. We show that this is the case by\ndescribing implementations of Ultra-Wide Word algorithms for dynamic\nprogramming and string searching. In addition, we show that the Ultra-Wide Word\nmodel can be used to implement a nonstandard memory architecture, which enables\nthe sidestepping of lower bounds of important data structure problems such as\npriority queues and dynamic prefix sums.

Adding more qubits improves the preservation\nby guaranteeing increasingly larger clusters of errors will not cause logical\nfailure - a key requirement for large-scale systems. Using QEC to extend the\nqubit lifetime remains one of the outstanding experimental challenges in\nquantum computing. Here, we report the protection of classical states from\nenvironmental bit-flip errors and demonstrate the suppression of these errors\nwith increasing system size. We use a linear array of nine qubits, which is a\nnatural precursor of the two-dimensional surface code QEC scheme, and track\nerrors as they occur by repeatedly performing projective quantum non-demolition\n(QND) parity measurements.

The planet\nitself has a high total density, suggesting that it may also have a high\nmetallicity in its atmosphere. We analyze two eclipses of the planet in each of\nthe 3.6- and 4.5 micron bands of Warm Spitzer. These data exhibit intra-pixel\ndetector sensitivity fluctuations that were resistant to traditional\ndecorrelation methods. We have developed a simple, powerful, and radically\ndifferent method to correct the intra-pixel effect for Warm Spitzer data, which\nwe call pixel-level decorrelation (PLD). PLD corrects the intra-pixel effect\nvery effectively, but without explicitly using - or even measuring - the\nfluctuations in the apparent position of the stellar image. We illustrate and\nvalidate PLD using synthetic and real data, and comparing the results to\nprevious analyses. PLD can significantly reduce or eliminate red noise in\nSpitzer secondary eclipse photometry, even for eclipses that have proven to be\nintractable using other methods. Our successful PLD analysis of four HAT-P-20b\neclipses shows a best-fit blackbody temperature of 1134 +/-29K, indicating\ninefficient longitudinal transfer of heat, but lacking evidence for strong\nmolecular absorption. We find sufficient evidence for variability in the 4.5\nmicron band that the eclipses should be monitored at that wavelength by\nSpitzer, and this planet should be a high priority for JWST spectroscopy. All\nfour eclipses occur about 35 minutes after orbital phase 0.5, indicating a\nslightly eccentric orbit. A joint fit of the eclipse and transit times with\nextant RV data yields e(cos{omega}) = 0.01352 (+0.00054, -0.00057), and\nestablishes the small eccentricity of the orbit to high statistical confidence.\nGiven the existence of a bound stellar companion, HAT-P-20b is another\nexcellent candidate for orbital evolution via Kozai migration or other\nthree-body mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2014 21:35:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2015 19:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-04"}

Our main results concern\nthe nontriviality of this map. We prove that for $2n \\geq 6$, the natural\n$KO$-orientation from the infinite loop space of the Madsen--Tillmann--Weiss\nspectrum factors (up to homotopy) through the space of metrics of positive\nscalar curvature on any $2n$-dimensional spin manifold.

Such prolonged runaway\ngreenhouses can lead to planetary evolution divergent from that of Earth.\nDuring this early runaway phase, photolysis of water vapor and hydrogen/oxygen\nescape to space can lead to the loss of several Earth oceans of water from\nplanets throughout the habitable zone, regardless of whether the escape is\nenergy-limited or diffusion-limited. We find that the amount of water lost\nscales with the planet mass, since the diffusion-limited hydrogen escape flux\nis proportional to the planet surface gravity. In addition to undergoing\npotential desiccation, planets with inefficient oxygen sinks at the surface may\nbuild up hundreds to thousands of bars of abiotically produced O$_2$, resulting\nin potential false positives for life.

Using the technique of reconstructing lensing\nsignals involved in CMB maps, this curl mode can be measured in an unbiased\nmanner, offering an independent confirmation of the gravitational waves\ncomplementary to the B-mode polarization experiments.

Our model of the\nsolar atmosphere is constructed by adopting a realistic temperature\ndistribution and specifying the curved magnetic field lines that constitute a\ncoronal loop. This loop is described by 2D, ideal magnetohydro- dynamic\nequations that are numerically solved by the FLASH code. Results. The vertical\nkink oscillations are excited by a periodic driver in the vertical component of\nvelocity, acting at the top of the photosphere.

This is achieved by\nadopting a new technique proposed in this paper called\ncross-convolutional-layer pooling.

These behaviors are undesirable in the sense\nthat agents make clearly suboptimal decisions over optimal ones. To capture\nsuch behaviors and more importantly, to quantify inefficiency caused by such\nbehaviors, [Kleinberg & Oren 2014] propose a graph model which is essentially\nsame as the standard planning model except for the cost structure.

It has a practically useful interpretation as the expected\nremaining lifetime given survival up to a particular time point, and it also\ncharacterizes the survival distribution. However, it has received limited\nattention in terms of inference methods under a probabilistic modeling\nframework. We seek to provide general inference methodology for mean residual\nlife regression. Survival data often include a set of predictor variables for\nthe survival response distribution, and in many cases it is natural to include\nthe covariates as random variables into the modeling. We thus employ Dirichlet\nprocess mixture modeling for the joint stochastic mechanism of the covariates\nand survival responses. This approach implies a flexible model structure for\nthe mean residual life of the conditional response distribution, allowing\ngeneral shapes for mean residual life as a function of covariates given a\nspecific time point, as well as a function of time given particular values of\nthe covariate vector. To expand the scope of the modeling framework, we extend\nthe mixture model to incorporate dependence across experimental groups, such as\ntreatment and control groups. This extension is built from a dependent\nDirichlet process prior for the group-specific mixing distributions, with\ncommon locations and weights that vary across groups through latent bivariate\nBeta distributed random variables.

Here we aim to\nderive the surface magnetic field geometry and chemical abundance distributions\nfor the extraordinary Ap star HD 75049. This object hosts a surface field of\n~30 kG, one of the strongest known for any non-degenerate star. We used\ntime-series of high-resolution HARPS intensity and circular polarisation\nobservations. These data were interpreted with the help of magnetic Doppler\nimaging and model atmospheres incorporating effects of a non-solar chemical\ncomposition and a strong magnetic field. We refined the rotational period of HD\n75049 to Prot=4.048267+/-0.000036 d. We also derived basic stellar parameters,\nTeff=10250+/-250 K and logg=4.3+/-0.1. Magnetic Doppler imaging revealed that\nthe field topology of HD 75049 is poloidal and dominated by a dipolar\ncontribution with a peak surface field strength of 39 kG. At the same time,\ndeviations from the classical axisymmetric oblique dipolar configuration are\nsignificant. Chemical surface maps of Si, Cr, Fe, and Nd show abundance\ncontrasts of 0.5-1.4 dex, which is low compared with many other Ap stars. Nd is\nfound to be enhanced close to the magnetic pole, whereas Si and Cr are\nconcentrated predominantly at the magnetic equator. The iron distribution shows\nlow-contrast features both at the magnetic equator and the pole. The morphology\nof the magnetic field and the properties of chemical spots in HD 75049 are\nqualitatively similar to those of Ap stars with weaker fields. Consequently,\nwhatever mechanism forms and sustains global magnetic fields in\nintermediate-mass main-sequence stars, it operates in the same way over the\nentire observed range of magnetic field strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 09:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

We\nprove that for LDPC codes, even if we include all redundant checks,\nasymptotically there is no gain in the LP decoder threshold on the BSC under\ncertain conditions on the base Tanner graph. First, we show that if the graph\nhas bounded check-degree and satisfies a condition which we call asymptotic\nstrength, then including high degree redundant checks in the LP does not\nsignificantly improve the threshold in the following sense: for each constant\ndelta>0, there is a constant k>0 such that the threshold of the LP decoder\ncontaining all redundant checks of degree at most k improves by at most delta\nupon adding to the LP all redundant checks of degree larger than k.

For submodular problems, cuts based methods can be employed to\nefficiently solve large-scale problems. However, general nonsubmodular problems\nare significantly more challenging to solve. Finding a solution when the\nproblem is of large size to be of practical interest, however, typically\nrequires relaxation. Two standard relaxation methods are widely used for\nsolving general BQPs--spectral methods and semidefinite programming (SDP), each\nwith their own advantages and disadvantages. Spectral relaxation is simple and\neasy to implement, but its bound is loose. Semidefinite relaxation has a\ntighter bound, but its computational complexity is high, especially for large\nscale problems. In this work, we present a new SDP formulation for BQPs, with\ntwo desirable properties. First, it has a similar relaxation bound to\nconventional SDP formulations. Second, compared with conventional SDP methods,\nthe new SDP formulation leads to a significantly more efficient and scalable\ndual optimization approach, which has the same degree of complexity as spectral\nmethods. We then propose two solvers, namely, quasi-Newton and smoothing Newton\nmethods, for the dual problem. Both of them are significantly more efficiently\nthan standard interior-point methods. In practice, the smoothing Newton solver\nis faster than the quasi-Newton solver for dense or medium-sized problems,\nwhile the quasi-Newton solver is preferable for large sparse/structured\nproblems. Our experiments on a few computer vision applications including\nclustering, image segmentation, co-segmentation and registration show the\npotential of our SDP formulation for solving large-scale BQPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 12:05:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2015 23:27:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 02:19:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 00:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

In\nparticular, we prove that this strong condition is fulfilled by applying the\nso-called conformal Laplace-Beltrami quantization prescription, where the\nconformal Laplacian operator contains the usual Laplace-Beltrami operator on\nthe underlying manifold plus a term proportional to its scalar curvature (which\nin both cases has non-constant value). In this way, the eigenvalue problems for\nthe quantum counterparts of ${\\cal H}_\\lambda$ and ${\\cal H}_\\eta$ can be\nrigorously solved, and it is found that their discrete spectrum is just a\nsmooth deformation (in terms of the parameters $\\lambda$ and $\\eta$) of the\noscillator and Coulomb spectrum, respectively. Moreover, it turns out that the\nmaximal degeneracy of both systems is preserved under deformation. Finally, new\nfurther multiparametric generalizations of both systems that preserve their\nsuperintegrability are envisaged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 12:16:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Dec 2014 20:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-15"}

Our\nstudy is solely based on Markovian environments where quantum channels are\nwithout memory and each qubit is coupled to its own environment. We start with\nmixed GHZ, mixed W, mixture of separable states, a mixed biseparable state, as\nthe initial states and mostly observe that the decay of quantum dissension is\nasymptotic in contrast to sudden death of quantum entanglement in similar\nenvironments. This is a clear indication of the fact that quantum correlation\nin general is more robust against the effect of noise. However, for a given\nclass of initial mixed states we find a temporary leap in quantum dissension\nfor a certain interval of time. More precisely, we observe the revival of\nquantum correlation to happen for certain time period. This signifies that the\nmeasure of quantum correlation such as quantum discord, quantum dissension,\ndefined from the information theoretic perspective is different from the\ncorrelation defined from the entanglement-separability paradigm and can\nincrease under the effect of the local noise.

This suggests that galaxies\nshould have inhomogeneous metal distributions with strong radial gradients, but\nobservations of present-day galaxies show only shallow gradients with little\nazimuthal variation, implying the existence of a redistribution mechanism. We\nstudy the role of gravitational instability-driven turbulence as a mixing\nmechanism by simulating an isolated galactic disc at high resolution, including\nmetal fields treated as passive scalars. Since any cylindrical field can be\ndecomposed into a sum of Fourier-Bessel basis functions, we set up initial\nmetal fields characterized by these functions and study how different modes\nmix. We find both shear and turbulence contribute to mixing, but the mixing\nstrongly depends on the symmetries of the mode. Non-axisymmetric modes have\ndecay times smaller than the galactic orbital period because shear winds them\nup to small spatial scales, where they are erased by turbulence. The decay\ntimescales for axisymmetric modes are much greater, though for all but the\nlargest-scale inhomogeneities the mixing timescale is still short enough to\nerase chemical inhomogeneities over cosmological times. These different\ntimescales provide an explanation for why galaxies retain metallicity gradients\nwhile there is almost no variation at a fixed radius. Moreover, the\ncomparatively long timescales required for mixing axisymmetric modes may\nexplain the greater diversity of metallicity gradients observed in high\nredshift galaxies as compared to local ones: these systems have not yet reached\nequilibrium between metal production and diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 13:23:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Feb 2015 20:09:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2015 08:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-23"}

These helix-like structures possess a\nhigh degree of flexibility that gives the biopolymers a unique extendibility.\nThis has been considered beneficial for piliated bacteria adhering to host\nsurfaces in the presence of a fluid flow. We show in this work that helix-like\npili have the ability to act as efficient dampers of force that can, for a\nlimited time, lower the load on the force-mediating adhesin-receptor bond on\nthe tip of an individual pilus.

In this paper, given a single input image of an\nobject, we synthesize new features for other views of the same object. To\naccomplish this, we introduce an aligned set of 3D models in the same class as\nthe input object image. Each 3D model is represented by a set of views, and we\nstudy the correlation of image patches between different views, seeking what we\ncall surrogates --- patches in one view whose feature content predicts well the\nfeatures of a patch in another view. In particular, for each patch in the novel\ndesired view, we seek surrogates from the observed view of the given image. For\na given surrogate, we predict that surrogate using linear combination of the\ncorresponding patches of the 3D model views, learn the coefficients, and then\ntransfer these coefficients on a per patch basis to synthesize the features of\nthe patch in the novel view. In this way we can create feature sets for all\nviews of the latent object, providing us a multi-view representation of the\nobject.

We develop an analytic solution for the topological properties\nof the integrated network produced by the model, finding that the time\ntranslation invariance of the degree distribution is broken. We validate our\npredictions against numerical simulations, and we check for the presence of\naging effects in a empirical temporal network, ruled by bursty social\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 15:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-24"}

Inherent\nuncertainty and natural variability of load models make the stability\nassessment especially difficult and may compromise the security of the system.\nWe propose a novel mathematical \"robust stability\" criterion for the assessment\nof small-signal stability of operating points. Whenever the criterion is\nsatisfied for a given operating point, it provides mathematical guarantees that\nthe operating point will be stable with respect to small disturbances for any\ndynamic response of the loads. The criterion can be naturally used for\nidentification of operating regions secure from the occurrence of Hopf\nbifurcation. Several possible applications of the criterion are discussed, most\nimportantly the concept of Robust Stability Assessment (RSA) that could be\nintegrated in dynamic security assessment packages and used in contingency\nscreening and other planning and operational studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Nov 2014 23:32:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 04:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-04-15"}

Following the classical\ndefinitions of identifiability and indistinguishability, we first derive a\ncondition that ensure the identifiability of the edge weights of $\\mathcal G$\nin terms of the associated transfer function. Using this characterization, we\npropose a sensor placement algorithm that guarantees identifiability of the\nedge weights.

Given that partisans are not likely to convert\nto a different party, a main goal for a party could be to mobilize independent\nvoters toward the party with the help of strong leadership, mass media,\npartisans, and effects of peer-to-peer influence. Based on the exact solution\nof the classical voter model dynamics in the presence of perfectly partisan\nvoters (i.e., zealots), we propose a computational method to maximize the share\nof the party in a social network of independent voters by pinning control\nstrategy. The party, corresponding to the controller or zealots, optimizes the\nnodes to be controlled given the information about the connectivity of\nindependent voters and the set of nodes that the opponent party controls. We\nshow that controlling hubs is generally a good strategy, whereas the optimized\nstrategy is even better. The superiority of the optimized strategy is\nparticularly eminent when the independent voters are connected as directed\nrather than undirected networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Nov 2014 10:54:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2015 15:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-03-31"}
